Looking back on their campaign platforms, we asked our elected officials to tell us about their successes and shortfalls throughout their terms in office.</em></p>\n<p>Although elected as A.S. president in April of last year, Austin Hechler was not sworn in until late August.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">His incumbency of the office was borne out of a months-long deliberation over a bribery scandal involving UC Santa Barbara’s fraternities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Elections Board claimed soon after election night in April that the Interfraternity Council (IFC) gave “monetary incentives” to its members who voted, alleging the organization believed votes could be “bought and sold.” The board called for a revote of the entire spring ballot.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77392\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77392\" data-attachment-id=\"77392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/as-austin-candidate-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=1400%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1400,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS-austin-Candidate-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?fit=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77392\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9-700x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C878\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=700%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1 171w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1123&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-austin-Candidate-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Former A.S. president Jimmy Villarreal, alongside the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department, launched an investigation into the claims but determined in late May that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of IFC.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler believes he might be the “shortest-term president” in A.S. history.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think we got a lot done, though,” he said in an interview on Monday. “I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler ran on four platform items last spring: launch an alternative transportation program for disabled students, reform campus sexual assault policy, push for the establishment of the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) and make course readers more affordable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After several months, the alternative transportation program has become what is now Gaucho Rides, a pilot program that offers disabled students free rides to and from campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler, along with former senator Jerel Constantino, proposed the program approximately two years ago when he served in A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In April 2016, the two senators reached out to Lyft, a rideshare app that allows users to hail a taxi on demand, and were able to secure a partnership with the company. A month later, A.S. Senate passed a resolution to allocate $40,000 to the alternative transportation program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Applications opened for the first time in September to enroll 20 disabled students for free Lyft rides between home and campus. Hechler’s office named the program “Gaucho Rides.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The pilot program shut down in the third week of Winter Quarter, and the <i>Nexus</i> is currently verifying the causal factors. Meanwhile, Hechler said his office is developing a “backup plan” in which students can receive rides without the use of codes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of the A.S. President will most likely re-launch Gaucho Rides later this week, Hechler said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> in September that, depending on how the program ran in the next two quarters, he and other advocates would consider pushing for a lock-in fee for it. This week’s A.S. Elections ballot does not include such a measure.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s next platform item — sexual assault reform — has resurfaced intermittently throughout his political career.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The issue arose in April 2015 during an A.S. candidate forum when Hechler was running for a seat on A.S. Senate. An anonymous audience member asked the candidates how they plan to address campus sexual assault, and Hechler answered in response that he intended to extend sexual assault prevention training to the Greek community.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything,” he said in 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler incorporated the same policy into his platform when running for president last year, calling it “one of the bigger parts of [his] platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said on Monday that this year, he spearheaded a campaign to have fraternities and sororities learn how to prevent sexual assault through the Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program was funded by Hechler’s office and solicited approximately 120 men and women from IFC and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alejandra Melgoza, who vied against Hechler in 2016, said she is yet to see Hechler involved in any of the monthly conversations with university administration concerning sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said Hechler has not yet released a statement about Sexual Assault Awareness Month or attended any events hosted by Take Back the Night, a student group dedicated to preventing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As President, he was also unable to keep his own senators who ran on a platform of sexual assault accountable,” Melgoza said in an email. “Sexual assault is not an issue that can be put on a platform to earn political capital. It affects many students personally, including myself.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said he has often sent representatives from his office to various meetings addressing campus sexual assault.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also promised in April 2016 to lead the push in A.S. for a CSD in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He and Ashcon Minoiefar, the A.S. external vice president of local affairs, worked closely together to gather volunteers for Yes on E&amp;F, a campaign which sought to establish the CSD through Measure E and fund the CSD with a special tax through Measure F.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As it turns out, voters in November overwhelmingly approved Measure E, thus creating the CSD, but did not pass Measure F, taking away the CSD’s main funding source.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fourth and final part of Hechler’s presidential campaign platform was to provide to students the least expensive course reader materials through a partnership with A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It was, like, a long process because at first we didn’t how to do it,” he said on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler’s office began work on this plan early on, sending out emails en masse to every professor at the university. The emails asked that faculty primarily use A.S. Publications instead of Alternative Digital Printing, the private printing business in the UCen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">His office later opted to contact academic department heads instead. He said some departments, such as the political science and environmental studies departments, responded positively. Others did not reply at all, he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The goal at the end of the day was to create a bank through Pubs where, I guess, professors could upload their things and students wouldn’t even have to buy it. It would just be on the internet; you know, environmentally friendly,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler said David Miller, the A.S. Publications staff member who died in March, told him that his office more than doubled the amount of course readers published through A.S. Publications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The plan to increase student use of A.S. Publications “died out,” Hechler said, after Miller passed away.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler also took up a few other projects outside of his platform items, including an initiative to expand the A.S. Food Bank and a push to give priority registration to ROTC students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Breanna Jones, the A.S. Food Bank committee chair, told the <i>Nexus</i> in early April that Hechler advocated strongly to university administration for the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[He] really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened,” she said in April.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Senate passed a bill earlier this month to give priority registration to ROTC students, and the resolution now awaits approval from the Academic Senate. Senator Alex Giolito, who introduced the bill alongside senator Riley Hobson, said two weeks ago that Hechler “brought this all together by reaching out to ROTC students first.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This year I’ve really tried to hold the senators accountable in ways that I never thought I would have to,” Hechler told the <i>Nexus</i> on Monday.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Melgoza said she found Hechler’s platform items to be “inherently hollow” and “lacked substance,” saying he had “no personal connection to anything on his platform.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She added that she never viewed Hechler as “someone with conviction” when they both served on A.S. Senate, and she said her views have not changed since.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There were other senators who I definitely disagreed with at the table but I still admired their dedication to their beliefs,” Melgoza said in an email. “Hechler on the other hand was constantly passive.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Arielle Kronovet, Hechler’s chief of staff, said Hechler’s kindness can often be mistaken for passivity and that he is actually “firm to his beliefs.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“He’s serious about leaving this school a better place, and I’ve seen him doing this throughout the year,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Talia Stringfellow, the A.S. president’s deputy chief of staff, said she found Hechler to be more decisive and communicative than his predecessor Villarreal, whom she worked for as an A.S. fellow the year before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sometimes [Villarreal] changed his mind and was not a big communicator,” she said. “Communication has been a huge, sweet [and] influential part of why I think Austin’s such a good president.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler will finish his term in the next few weeks, handing the presidency to whomever students elect Thursday night. In the meantime, Hechler said, he is applying for jobs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s funny because I bet everyone thinks, ‘Oh you have a nice title; you’re going to find a job easily.’ It’s not that easy. It’s really not,” he said. “Honestly I had no idea you had to apply to jobs so early.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hechler looks to receive his degree in political science in June. Wherever he ends up in the next few years, he said, he wants to continue in public service.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I really just want to give back to communities,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been so privileged to have so many great opportunities in my life, and I want to give that back to people wherever I am.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-a-s-president-austin-hechler/","id":3953,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3952,3951,3950],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Despite Calif.

A series of sustained rains could be the only remedy for Southern California’s drought. <em> Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>For the past five years, Lake Cachuma has been shriveling in size as rain levels drop to historical lows, measured as the driest five years on record. Despite promises of heavy El Niño rains in 2016, the Santa Barbara area received only 70 percent of the expected precipitation, resulting in wildfires and rapidly diminishing reservoirs.</p>\n<p>Large amounts of rain at the beginning of 2017 left many hopeful for a swift end to California’s six-year drought. According to the Santa Barbara County Reservoir and Rainfall report, the county has received 135 percent of normal rainfall this year.</p>\n<p>Storms beginning this week may affect the drought classification in Santa Barbara; even large storms last week did not abate a D4 status which classifies Santa Barbara as in “exceptional drought.” The rest of the state, however, is down to two percent D4 conditions from over 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The National Weather Forecast estimated peak precipitation levels between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. the night of Jan. 18, when the county was projected to receive between 0.26 and 0.49 inches of rain. A second storm is expected to arrive Thursday evening and continue through mid-Friday with an estimated one to three inches of rain.</p>\n<p>The third and largest storm is expected to arrive Sunday, which at minimum will have as much precipitation as the storm before it.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, the deputy public works director for Santa Barbara County, said he feels “cautiously optimistic” about the upcoming storms’ effects on Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>“The drought’s not over, but a little bit of relief is good,” Fayram said. “We will see some inflow into Lake Cachuma; it stands to put water in the reservoir for the first time since 2011.”</p>\n<p>KK Holland, from the Goleta Water District, said, “The biggest potential impact will likely be not from local rainfall here, but an increased state water allocation due to the heavy rains in the northern part of the state.”</p>\n<p>Despite the seeming lack of impact, Holland said, the district is “obviously thrilled to see much needed rain.”</p>\n<p>The last drought report released Jan. 12 by the National Drought Mitigation Center showed “major changes were made” across California due to the increased precipitation this year, but water supply in Santa Barbara County still lags way below normal with a “measly” increase in Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>According to a report from the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District released last week, Lake Cachuma was over 753 feet in elevation in 2011, and it stored over 193,300 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>Today, Lake Cachuma is at 651.79 foot elevation and is storing 17,757 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>This is only 9.2 percent of capacity, which is 193,305 acre-feet. In order for Santa Barbara to move down to D3, which means the area is in “extreme drought,” there would need to be more hydrological impact on Lake Cachuma, which fulfills around half the water needs of the South Coast.</p>\n<p>David Miskus, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and author of last week’s drought report, said, as far as “hydrological improvement,” Santa Barbara is “not very affected.”</p>\n<p>Tim DeVries, an assistant professor in the UCSB geography department, said the county will need double the expected rainfall in 2017 and 2018 to offset the drought. The average rainfall in 2016 was half the expected average, meaning an end to the drought would require four times that value for the next two years.</p>\n<p>“This year, we got 18 inches of rain, and what we’d need is essentially two consecutive years of 30 inches of rain,” DeVries said. “Right now, we’re perhaps on track for that this year, it’s kind of too early to say.”</p>\n<p>Much of the status of the drought will be contingent on February, which has historically been California’s wettest month.</p>\n<p>Goleta Water District declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency in May 2015, with a target of decreasing water usage by 35 percent. The district has imposed restrictions on outdoor watering, agricultural water usage and mandates that hotels and other lodging post notices of water shortage.</p>\n<p>Conservation in Goleta to date has been around 27 percent, though for some months conservation has been as high as 40 percent, with “single family consumers” conserving the most.</p>\n<p>According to Holland, the rainfall totals to date for the year are eight inches for Goleta.</p>\n<p>“That isn’t enough to offset the previous years of below average rainfall,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We are still early in the rainy season and the watershed is so dry that until this last storm, there wasn’t enough rain to get any inflow into the lake.”</p>\n<p>There are five different water shortage stages, with stage one requesting voluntary conservation and stage two beginning to mandate conservation, especially of outdoor watering.</p>\n<p>Despite the large amounts of rain, Holland said she remains pessimistic about the future of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“The most recently released drought index shows the South Coast as one of the only remaining areas of the state to still be in exceptional drought,” she said in an email. “If anything, additional restrictions on outdoor watering may become necessary by summer.”</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether this drought is a symptom of human-caused climate change because of the relatively short time period; climate change is generally observed over the course of several decades.</p>\n<p>“If we go into a 30-year dry spell, then we can pretty much say, okay, this is climate change, this is not due to natural climate variability, this is human caused,” DeVries said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

are on the precipice of a major set of election victories here in California.”</p>\n<p>“Now more than ever, this country needs a blue beacon of hope like California,” he said, and with Democratic candidates sweeping California polls, that is what it became.</p>\n<p>Because California’s system gives the general election spot to the top two primary winners regardless of party, the senator replacing Barbara Boxer was guaranteed to be a Democrat.</p>\n<p>Endorsed by the Democratic Party and Barack Obama, Kamala Harris was the party’s top choice. She won in a landslide victory, with 62.5 percent of votes, sweeping even her opponent Loretta Sanchez’s home county.</p>\n<p>Democratic candidate Carbajal won the race for the House of Representatives, defeating Republican opponent Justin Fareed. He will be representing California’s 24th District, which covers Santa Barbara County, San Luis Obispo County and part of Ventura County.</p>\n<p>Responding to dejected Democrats after Clinton’s loss, he exclaimed, “Don’t cry, get involved,” a statement that encompasses the tone of Carbajal’s race and statement after his victory.</p>\n<p>He ran on a platform of equality, promising to tackle LGBTQ discrimination and the wage gap, along with championing for the environment and the middle class.</p>\n<p>“I’m committed to all those issues,” he announced at Tuesday’s Democratic watch party. “Let’s stay positive; we’re gonna get there”.</p>\n<p>On the statewide level, incumbent Jackson ran unopposed for state senator for the 19th district, cinching another term at the state legislature.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74101\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74101\" data-attachment-id=\"74101\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/local-democrats-sweep-elections/dems-by-jenny-luo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Salud Carbajal\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74101 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dems-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74101\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Newly elected U.S. Representitive of the 24th District of California, Salud Carbajal, delivers his acceptance speech at The Mill in Santa Barbara.

She will replace incumbent Das Williams, who sought a seat on the Santa Barbara County board of supervisors rather than reelection.</p>\n<p>“You have just elected the first Latina from Santa Barbara and Ventura County to represent you,” Limón said to a cheering crowd before going on to thank the UCSB and SBCC students who “volunteered countless hours” to help the Democratic campaigns.</p>\n<p>Addressing Clinton’s loss, she said, “It just means we’re going to have to fight harder, and that is what we will continue to do.”</p>\n<p>At the Santa Barbara Democratic watch party Tuesday night, Sommer Marcela expressed her support for Limón.<br>\n“I followed her trajectory for years” she said. “She has been a member of the community, she grew up here and I think she is the right person to represent me and the community.”</p>\n<p>After a close race, Joan Hartmann won a decisive victory over Bruce Porter for county supervisor of the Third District.<br>\nUCSB students played a big role in Hartmann’s victory. In the primary election, she had received 59.6 percent of the Isla Vista and UCSB vote, while Porter only received 9.2 percent.</p>\n<p>“It’s because of the very, very hard work of the Democratic activists,” Williams said of Isla Vista’s high voter turnout.  “I think we’re going to see some great things. I think we’re going to see Joan elected because of it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

She said she will work with the UCSA in a UC-wide effort to address affordability, focusing first on public knowledge and making students aware of the rising tuition fees that face them.</p>\n<p>Khabra said she does not have much experience with Isla Vista and, in her interview with the <em>Nexus, </em>she mostly discussed her intention to streamline A.S. and make sure communication was improved between departments.</p>\n<p>Hieu Le and Nawar Nemeh, the two A.S. president candidates from Campus United and Isla Vista Party, respectively, said they welcomed Khabra’s campaign.</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he is glad Khabra share some similar values to the Isla Vista Party, while Le said he approves of any student’s ability to participate in student elections.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77292\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/navpreet-khabra-announces-write-in-candidacy-for-a-s-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77292\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/navpreet-khabra-announces-write-in-candidacy-for-a-s-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/navpreet-khabra-announces-write-in-candidacy-for-a-s-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/navpreet-khabra-announces-write-in-candidacy-for-a-s-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/navpreet-khabra-announces-write-in-candidacy-for-a-s-president/","id":3952,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3951,3950,3949],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
