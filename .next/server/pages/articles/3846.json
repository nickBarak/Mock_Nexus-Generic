As an afterthought, the man told the officers the sickly squatter was also bleeding from the forehead.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, the deputies followed the man to his house and into the bathroom. There, they found an 18-year old girl sitting atop a pile of her own puke, completely in the nude, blood trickling down from an eyebrow piercing.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the drunken CSU Northridge student if she knew where she was or whose house she was in, but she didn’t have any idea. Furthermore, the puking princess could not tell the deputies where she staying nor where she lived.</p>\n<p>When asked how much alcohol she had consumed, she said five shots and told the officers she was feeling “drunk.” She did not know how she had caused her piercing to bleed, though the deputies suspected a tumble had caused the injury.</p>\n<p>Fearing that the nude Northridger would end up somewhere she would regret, the officers decided to arrest her for public intoxication. After collecting her clothing, the deputies transported the out-of-towner to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., Jan. 31, 10:03 p.m. – Officers on 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were alerted to possible trouble by the sound of a car horn.</p>\n<p>Looking down the street, the deputies spotted a young man staggering down the center of the street, with a yellow taxi right on his heels. The taxi driver was unable to get around the sloppy stroller and, out of frustration, had reverted to repeated use of his horn.</p>\n<p>Despite the ruckus behind him, the inebriated 21-year old refused to step aside. When the officers approached and told the young man to get out of the street, he replied, “Well, you’re walking in the road.”</p>\n<p>The deputies, brushing the failed attempt at argument aside, escorted the man, and the girl that was with him, to the sidewalk. The officers then informed the drunken reveler of the dangers associated with walking down the middle of the street and told him to head straight home. His female counterpart, who the officers learned was his girlfriend, ensured the deputies he would do so and they walked off in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, less than a minute later an argument ensued and the officers watched as the childlike 21-year old pulled away from his girlfriend, shouting that he wasn’t going to go home.</p>\n<p>Having escaped the grasp of his woman, the young man fell right into the hands of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who arrested him for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Wild Alaska<br>\nSun., Feb. 1, 2:05 a.m. – A young woman walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive – swaying as she went – caught the eye of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the clearly intoxicated female stumbled down the center of the street, cell phone in hand. The 19-year old then made for the sidewalk, but when she attempted to step up onto the curb, her foot got caught on the curb and she face-planted onto the cement. The deputies then watched as she sat up and promptly returned to her phone conversation.</p>\n<p>   The officers approached the sidewalk sitter and asked her if she knew where she was. She replied she was either in Las Vegas or Alaska, but could not decide which.</p>\n<p>Somewhat befuddled, the deputies asked if there was anyone she could call to come and get her, and the inebriated UCSB student was quick to dial a number. Explaining it was her brother, and that he would take care of her, she handed the phone to the officer, who introduced himself.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the line, the brother informed the officer that he could not come and get his sister since he was in his home state of Alaska.</p>\n<p>With no other option, the deputies arrested the severely misplaced women and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, however, the Las Vegas native vomited in the back seat of the car. Once out of the car, she fell over, hit her head, and temporarily lost consciousness.</p>\n<p>A nurse attended to the fallen reveler and determined she was too drunk to spend the night in jail and the young woman was subsequently transported to the hospital.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18233\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18233\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/","id":3846,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3845,3844,3843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Could You Help Me Zip Up?\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. - Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Could You Help Me Zip Up?<br>\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. – Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for a place to relieve himself.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old man found a wall, unzipped and started to drunkenly write his name in urine on the bricks. The officer approached the man and stood behind him as he finished. Ten seconds later, the man was done peeing and face to face with Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officer escorted him to the curb and asked for his name and date of birth. The piss-drunk pee-er told the officers his name was George Douglas McClaren – a fake – and that his date of birth was 9-21-88 – also fake.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, it didn’t take the officer long to determine he was being lied to and even less time to the arrest the dishonest urinator.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the drunken reveler was transported to the Isla Vista Station while the arrested deputy did the paperwork. A minute later, the dams burst open and Mr. McClaren vomited all over himself and the floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed him outside, where he continued to intermediately upchuck on himself. Then the 20-year-old sat motionless with his eyes closed and pissed himself.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Have You Seen My Wife?<br>\nFri., Jan. 2, 4:43 a.m. – Officers working the late shift received a report of two middle-aged men hiding in and shouting from the bushes in front of 6621 Abrego Rd.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the deputies spotted the two men walking westbound down Abrego. The officers contacted the former bush-lovers, and one of them – a heavily intoxicated 58-year-old – immediately became argumentative and combative.</p>\n<p>Since his age was clearly not a concern, the deputies started by asking why the man was out walking around I.V. at 5 in the morning. His answer was frank, albeit completely untrue. He told the officers he had gotten into a fight with his wife earlier in the night and that she had kicked him out of the house.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that he had been trying to walk his intoxicated friend home when they fell into the bushes.</p>\n<p>A quick call to the Mrs., however, revealed a much different story. She told the officers that she and her husband no longer lived together and that he was currently residing in downtown Santa Barbara. The estranged wife added that her husband had also taken to sleeping in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park with the local transient population.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the officers had plenty to work with and arrested the twiggy man, transporting him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You Guys Got a Light?<br>\nMon., Jan. 12, 1:49 a.m. – While on patrol, two officers spotted a man staggering down the middle of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The two officers stood at the corner of Abrego and Camino Del Sur and watched as the man approached. The clearly inebriated man then proceeded to stumble into the middle of the intersection – with two cars fast approaching – and addressed the deputies.</p>\n<p>“You got a light for my cigarette?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The officers kindly asked the man to walk out of the street. The 31-year-old SBCC student refused, however, and shouted, “Fuck you guys,” at the officers.</p>\n<p>Even though the cops had ignored his request for a light, shouting profanities at the police – especially when drunk – is almost never a smart call. The officers walked over to the man, took him by the arm and escorted him to the sidewalk. Once there, they arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18026\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18026\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/","id":3843,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3842,3841,3840],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Bringing Down the House\n\nFri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. - Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Bringing Down the House</p>\n<p>Fri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.</p>\n<p>Once inside the house, the two inebriated men were overtaken by drunken douchebaggery. The deputies watched as they proceeded to destroy an assortment of objects in the house by throwing them to the ground.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached, the two troublemakers made for the backdoor and out into the backyard. While one of the males was able to get away, the second got tripped up and fell into the arms of the law.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the intoxicated man why he was in the abandoned house and he replied, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.” Confused, the officer asked a second time but the man just repeated himself, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.”</p>\n<p>Having taken note of his strange answer, the officer then asked the 23-year old to recite his alphabet. “A, B, C,” he started, “E, G, H, I, H, Z.”</p>\n<p>Feeling certain the man was too intoxicated to take care of himself, the officers arrested and transported him to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station. While waiting for his paperwork to be completed, the man was placed on a chair in the station’s drunk tank. However, he was too drunk to sit in a chair properly, and, after a few minutes, he fell off the chair and landed on the side of his head, which caused a few small abrasions on his ear and cheek.</p>\n<p>The man was treated for his injuries and then taken to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Go Slugs!</p>\n<p>Sat., Jan 17, 3:08 a.m. – An intoxicated female nearly got run over by two officers driving their patrol car on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>The 19-year old woman was stumbling down the street with her head down and apparently did not see the approaching police car. Just as the car was about to pass, the inebriated stroller staggered to the side and directly in front of the squad car.</p>\n<p>The officers hit the brakes and backed up the vehicle to talk with the drunken UC Santa Cruz student. The deputies tried to ask the young lady about her condition but had trouble understanding her answers. It seemed to the deputy that the woman’s mouth was filled with something and he asked why. She told the officer she had “cottonmouth” and when asked why she said, “‘Cause there was so much to drink.”</p>\n<p>While she was able to correctly recite her alphabet, the drunken out-of-towner was otherwise at a total loss. She could not understand why she was talking with the police or why they were asking so many questions.</p>\n<p>Despite her confusion, the officers asked the woman, who weighed about 120 pounds, how much alcohol she had consumed. She replied, “Seven shots of vodka and five beers.” With ample evidence, the deputies arrested the Banana Slug for public intoxication and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending a good salting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/","id":3844,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3843,3842,3841],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Approximately 10 males at the corner of Embarcadero Del Norte and Segovia Road who were surrounding a young woman with her back against a fence sparked the interest of patrolling officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Third Time’s the Charm</p>\n<p>Thurs., Nov. 20, 1:06 a.m. — Approximately 10 males at the corner of Embarcadero Del Norte and Segovia Road who were surrounding a young woman with her back against a fence sparked the interest of patrolling officers.</p>\n<p>The deputies interrupted the lopsided powwow and inquired into the young lady’s welfare. She drunkenly informed the officers she was going to a nearby sorority.</p>\n<p>Despite being unable to complete her ABCs, the deputies allowed the inebriated 18-year-old to go after instructing her to walk straight to the sorority with a man she indicated was her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>The officers then rode their bikes a block away and turned to watch the drunken sorority sister. Instead of walking toward her sorority, however, the young woman and her boy-toy – driven by the drunchies – headed straight for Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the pair again and reminded the hungry girl of her instructions. After another failed alphabet test, the deputies let her go once more and continued to watch.</p>\n<p>The pair then walked toward campus and headed into the Pardall tunnel. The deputies stopped her for a third time and asked what she was doing. This time, she informed the officers that she was returning to her dorm room.</p>\n<p>The deputies explained that this was their third time talking with her and asked her how much she had imbibed. She responded by saying, “More than I should have.” At this point, the officers had no option but to arrest her, which they did.</p>\n<p>She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>But I’m Just Drunk</p>\n<p>Fri., Nov. 21, 5:55 p.m. — A man was spotted stumbling down the sidewalk in front of Berrilicious, forcing Isla Vista’s finest into action.</p>\n<p>Deputies watched as the older male attempted to put one foot in front of the other without much success. On several occasions, the inebriated man lost his balance and nearly fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the 43-year-old transient and immediately concluded he was exceedingly intoxicated.</p>\n<p>When the deputies attempted to question him, his words were so severely slurred that he could not be understood. After several failed attempts at human conversation, the day-drinking drunk finally admitting to drinking “a beer.” The officers concluded he was either an extreme lightweight, or he was lying about his consumption.</p>\n<p>Either way, a few minutes later he stated that all he had done was “get drunk” and could not understand why he was getting arrested. The officers calmly explained that public intoxication was a crime and subsequently arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Dare to D.A.R.E.</p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 22, 5:15 p.m. — An officer was on duty at UCSB’s Robertson Gym when he was informed that someone may have been jumping on the hood of a D.A.R.E. patrol car.</p>\n<p>As the deputy was walking out to the car, he noticed a middle-aged male moving away from the vehicle. He stopped the suspect and detained him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the 36-year-old man what he was doing, but the individual said nothing at first. The deputy asked again, and the suspect said, “I was going to smash the D.A.R.E. vehicle.” He then went on to say, “I wanted to talk to Gregg Wilson so I could see my old swim records. They wouldn’t let me so I jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. I told them I was going to smash it.”</p>\n<p>When asked what the D.A.R.E. car had to do with Gregg Wilson, the seemingly sober man said, “I’m the named assistant swim coach for Gregg Wilson,” and offered no other reasoning.</p>\n<p>The deputy then inspected the car and noticed that the suspect had caused two small dents in the hood.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed the man under arrest and escorted him to his patrol car. Still not understanding, the officer asked once more why the man had jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. The swim-obsessed man replied that he was upset because he couldn’t see his old records. When asked again why jumping on the car had anything to do with seeing the swim records, he said, “I don’t know, I was upset.”</p>\n<p>The man was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending anger management.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/","id":3845,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3844,3843,3842],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
