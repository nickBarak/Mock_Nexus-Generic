Passersby stared into the space in front of the tower, wondering why the crowd had gathered — especially since it was prime time for lunch or afternoon classes. The eager group, some of whom had sacrificed both food and learning, was awaiting an afternoon set from Homeshake, the synth-pop project of singer and multi-instrumentalist Peter Sagar.</p>\n<p>Homeshake, currently on tour behind Fresh Air, made a quick stop here in Santa Barbara, presented as part of the noon concert series. This show continues a tradition that is 30 years strong; Program Board’s noon Storke shows started in the early ’80s. The campus population’s music tastes have, of course, changed since then, so the ASPB team tries to account for our wide variety of tastes. Justin Taing, Program Board’s special events assistant, said that his goal is to “get a good mix of local and traveling bands, a combination of my own tastes and people I think would be a good fit.” It is also important for himself and ASPB as a whole to keep in mind the flexibility that the open space of Storke provides in terms of audience accessibility and movement. As anticipation for Homeshake grew, the crowd was visibly pleased, content with Program Board’s appeal to their indie sensibilities.</p>\n<p>Homeshake began in 2013 with the release of The Homeshake Tape. Another cassette followed, and the project was eventually signed to indie label Sinderlyn, which released Homeshake’s debut album In The Shower. Before departing to focus on Homeshake, his misleading moniker for work that is mostly solo, Sagar was a guitarist for Mac DeMarco’s backing band. Echoes of DeMarco’s brand of slacker rock can occasionally be heard in Homeshake’s easygoing sound. In fact, Homeshake and DeMarco are part of a festival-favorite group of Canadian acts, including folk-pop singer Andy Shauf and dream rock band Alvvays.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While setting up the various pedals and effects boxes necessary for his woozy, warm sound, Sagar did not participate in much banter with the audience. He quietly worked on getting everything positioned just right, his thick yellow sweatshirt and khaki-colored pants almost inappropriate for the early April heat. Five minutes past noon, he signaled up to the makeshift soundbooth perched at the top step above Storke, and launched into the instrumental “Hello Welcome,” the opening track from Fresh Air. His bite-sized songs are a good fit for the hour-long slots for Storke shows, creating a set jam packed with tasty sounds.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76892\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2105788950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76891\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76892\" data-attachment-id=\"76892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/homeshake-brings-silky-sounds-to-storke/homeshake/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"homeshake\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Min Xie / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Next on Homeshake’s short setlist was “Call Me Up,” a single that has become one of their most popular tracks. This song belongs on the suggestive playlists of college kids, particularly if they want to impress a girl or guy that’s into cool music. Over catchy, staccato synth notes that replicate the melody of the song, Sagar sings, “Any time you want to just call me up, and I’ll answer you.” His falsetto, manipulated heavily by his ensemble of electronics, melted seamlessly into the day. However, a few songs into the set, he commented that it was “weird playing in the sunlight.” Homeshake does not boast a sound that is daytime-ready, but nonetheless, the soulful melodies were pleasantly warm.</p>\n<p>At the first notes of “Khmlwugh,” a few cheers came from the front of the audience. The track is one of Homeshake’s sexiest and most instantly recognizable. Homeshake’s entire catalog flirts heavily with the sensual, but this song brings it to the forefront with a steady drum beat, unhurried keyboards and Sagar’s voice in its lower register. “Kissing, hugging, making love, waking up, getting high” is what the letters of the song’s unpronounceable title stand for. Homeshake has a charming way of marrying jazz fluidity and R&amp;B chill with soulful grooves. The songs’ warbling instrumentals paired with Sagar’s soft vocals serve as a foil to one another, but these elements are able to create contrast without tension.</p>\n<p>“Making a Fool of You,” from Homeshake’s debut In The Shower, was another familiar track, centered around a jam session bass line. By the middle of the set, a sizable group of people had formed in front of the speakers of the outdoor, makeshift stage, most of them having ditched their Vans to dance barefoot on the pavement.</p>\n<p>Although Sagar and his band moved through the set with little banter, presumably due to obvious time constraints, he did take time to thank everyone who was watching. Peering through his oversized, round, black sunglasses, he commented, “Pretty nice campus, congratulations. I hope you all have an easy time getting out of debt.” His dry sense of humor seems stifled in writing, but his joke was tinged with sincerity.</p>\n<p>Homeshake closed the show with the sunny, midtempo “Home at Last.” As I looked around at the moving bodies, tapping feet and nodding heads, I felt at home: a few weeks into a Santa Barbara spring with the sun shining like it never left in the first place.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

In the dim light of Campbell Hall, I could see smiles and mouths agape in awe and after every song or hear people gasp and whisper words of astonished praise. This kind of reaction comes from an appreciation of a time-honored American tradition: a celebration of 20th century culture and the musical legacy of people from across the nation. At the finale of UCSB’s Jazz series, artists Aaron Diehl, Adam Birnbaum and Cécile McLorin Salvant brought that musical tradition to life.</p>\n<p>UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures concluded a collection of jazz performances on Tuesday night with “Jelly and George: Celebrating the Music of Jelly Roll Morton &amp; George Gershwin.” The event featured a group of prominent contemporary jazz musicians, including Diehl and Birnbaum on the piano and Salvant as the ensemble’s vocalist. The performance showcased some of Morton and Gershwin’s more obscure jazz compositions, written at the beginning of the jazz age in the 1910s and 1920s.</p>\n<p>“These are two very important American composers,” Diehl explained, “but they never knew each other. I imagine if they did, they would be what we would call ‘frenemies.’”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The “Jelly Roll Blues” demonstrated the dynamics of Morton’s music with growing volume and complexity throughout the piece. The song began with the dual pianos, Diehl and Birnbaum, joining in counter melody. Birnbaum’s hands flowed down the keys, creating a sound effect like something falling. Diehl countered the other pianist’s flair with high, magical-sounding trills. The song transitioned to a steadier, more forceful rhythm as Paul Sikivie increased his volume on the bass.</p>\n<p>Lawrence Leathers on the drums gave the song a New Orleans vibe with heavy use of the snare. The southern jazz style was complete as three other musicians on trombone, trumpet and clarinet emerged from backstage, playing with clear, bright tones.</p>\n<p>The next Morton song, “Sidewalk Blues,” used the full ensemble to create a different musical atmosphere. The song began with Leathers blowing a train whistle and honking a car horn, while the rest of the musicians shouted and called to each other from across the stage. The cacophony of noise mimicked the soundscape of a downtown city street. The song transitioned from a steady beat that built with the whine of the trumpet to a peaceful, lulling duet between trumpet and clarinet, like a leisurely stroll. The soothing melody was continuously interrupted, however, by the train and car sounds. Through music, the band was able to recreate the environment of urban 20th century America.</p>\n<p>As Salvant took the stage, the audience roared with excitement, signifying her presence and success within the jazz community. Low, pounding piano began the song “I Hate A Man Like You,” creating a dark, angry tone. Salvant’s vocals started off slow and sassy, getting higher and more nasal, as though mocking someone. As the song continued, her voice grew louder and deeper with stylishly retro vibrato and rich, full low notes. She grinded her voice fiercely at the beginning of the third verse, mirroring the song’s spiteful lyrics. Her vocals carried the emotional weight of the song and told its story through inflection.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76321\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"495809154\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76320\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76321\" data-attachment-id=\"76321\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/aarondiehl_cecilemcloransalvant_930x400/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=930%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"930,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=888%2C382&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76321\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400-250x108.jpg?resize=250%2C108\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"108\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?w=930&amp;ssl=1 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Kuumbwa Jazz</p></div>\n<p>The tone of the performance changed completely with the next number, “Black Bottom Stomp.” Diehl felt that the piece “combines the best of New Orleans and Chicago jazz.” The clip-clopping percussion complimented the upbeat and cheery melody with Brandon Lee blasting high notes on the trumpet. Diehl and Birnbaum’s piano solos recalled the ragtime style with energetic and quick piano chords and a mixture of both high and low notes.</p>\n<p>After the whirlwind of the upbeat tune, Corey Wilcox thrilled the audience with an elaborate trombone solo. The number was filled with anticipation as Wilcox began with low, vibrating tones and slowly began to climb to higher notes. The other band members began clapping along and shouting words of encouragement as the trombone wailed through clear, high notes. Wilcox demonstrated his control of the sound with trills and stylistic wavering in the notes. After each sustained wail, audience members gasped and a few even hooted with approval. When the piece ended, the crowd went wild with applause and whistles.</p>\n<p>The final song, “I Got Rhythm,” served as a reminder of jazz’s role in American popular culture. The number started with a deconstructed melody, with each instrument playing a fragment of the familiar tune. The band members comically interacted with each other, Leathers using his train whistle and car horn again, while Evan Christopher squeaked out high notes on his clarinet. The musicians hollered and shouted at one another and began the upbeat, catchy tempo with heavy percussion and a steady baseline. Salvant returned to the stage with a clear, sweet voice as she sang the nostalgic lyrics with a friendly smile. The entire band finished together with one final appreciation for jazz music and jazz culture.</p>\n<p>The show inspired both admiration and awe in audience members as the crowd leapt up in an immediate standing ovation after the finale. Music lovers of all ages buzzed with excitement and words of praise as they left the theatre, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of jazz on the entire country. This final installment of the Jazz series represented the legacy of musical talent: combining classic music with new prominent artists.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76320\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76320\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/","id":6694,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6693,6692,6691],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rising Duo Joyzu Bring Bright Sounds to SB","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103725_1871483653063170_206836207472671305_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103725_1871483653063170_206836207472671305_n.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While witnessing Joyzu play live at M8TRX nightclub, the one thing that stood out most was the joy they shared on stage, which their stage name aptly foreshadows.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a cold Thursday night, a packed crowd filled the dimly lit dance floor at M8TRX nightclub in downtown Santa Barbara. The club goers were rowdy and ready for Joyzu to play their set. Many were there because they were familiar with the duo’s name but weren’t sure how they would perform live. As the two small-town kids took over the reins, a Joyzu remix of “We Will Rock You” by Queen started to play. With heavy themes centered around trap styles, the build up to the song established high-tension energy in the room. Suddenly, the carbon dioxide cannons filled with cold air fired off on the dance floor as the drop hit. The lights, lasers and specially made Joyzu graphics danced and supplemented the beat and drops in breathtaking fashion: they came to rock the people of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joyzu, an EDM music group from the small town of El Dorado Hills, Calif., features two young producers, Carson Willms and Quinton Pope. At the respective ages of 22 and 21 years old, the two small-town kids have already built an impressive résumé that is making big-city crowds take notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After releasing their hit single “Hear You Say,” the group gained momentum, even garnering major-label attention. Willms and Pope, as you know now, are not your typical college DJs, but are your common college students. Willms and Pope attend college, work jobs, occasionally talk to girls and are busy making their way through the EDM music scene.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been best friends ever since middle school, but got into dance music around the beginning of high school,” Willms and Pope said in a joint interview.  “We fell in love with the genre so much that is pushed us to pursue production and DJing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The love and passion they share for the music definitely shows in their product. While witnessing Joyzu play live at M8TRX nightclub, the one thing that stood out most was the joy they shared on stage, which their stage name aptly foreshadows. The duo danced around on stage, head banged and threw their hands up and down as epic beats dropped on their audience in epic fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Joyzu had so much fun with their music, the crowd responded with relentless energy. Of course the music itself was incredible, but the true difference was the distinct feel in the crowd once Joyzu took the stage and started playing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are many inspirations that inspire us to keep pursuing music. One being our favorite artists that we look up to who continue to push boundaries, such as Porter Robinson, Skrillex, Zeds Dead, What so Not, Chance the Rapper and Childish Gambino, just to name a few,” they said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of their artistic influences can be heard in their music. Still, the music Joyzu produces maintains a unique sound that must be heard to fully understand. As someone who admittedly does not listen to much EDM music, their music can best be described as high energy, with amazing drops that are not too over the top — a nice change of pace from the music of most electronic duos. The music is also complemented with precise vocals and lyrics that extend the energy of the music even further. The music itself, let alone the incredibly fun atmosphere the two producers create, will leave you wondering how these guys get paid to have this much fun. Next time they are in town, which may be sooner than you think, do not miss the opportunity to see two young kids from a small town in California live out their dreams.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76489\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76489\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/","id":6695,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Oh man, oh man. Not again. Drake came back with his heavily anticipated </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “playlist,” which means Twitter and Spotify may need to increase bandwidth to accommodate the massive influx of traffic for the foreseeable future. The lengthy follow-up to the 6 God’s fourth studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Views</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, features some heavy-hitters such as Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Travis Scott and more. The project is eclectic and dynamic, providing listeners with a little taste of every side of one of pop culture’s most captivating figures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank Ocean once asked, “What’s a king to a god?” Well, in 2017, content is king, and Drake is a self-proclaimed god (of the 6 variety). So to answer your question, Frank, in the context of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-era Drizzy, the king is everything to the god. Twenty-two tracks is Drake’s longest project to date. It could take months to consume all of that content. And it will. It’s all part of the plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake is a calculated artist. We must not forget that when the rest of the rap game sleeps, the 6 God schemes. And plots. All of this on the low, of course. He is a poster child for post-modernism; in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘s 80-minute lifespan, he crosses over to pop, switches back to rap, reveals insecurities, displays confidence and even borrows cultural accents. By calling the project a “playlist,” he grants himself immunity and freedom from the pressures of typical album expectations.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tsunami of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reviews will have already clogged your newsfeed by the time this is published. Don’t pay attention to most of them. Too many internet-dwellers simply turn a first impression into an arbitrary letter grade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reviewing the work of an artist as big as Drake, there is a major “micro vs. macro” distinction that must be addressed. A micro-level review pits an artist’s new release against his/her own discography, while a macro-level review compares a new project’s quality to that of recent releases from other contemporary artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the most part, today’s Drake-related micro-level reviews would suggest that he can’t win. Just take a look at the Fifth Estate’s reaction to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Views</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite its unprecedented streaming success, the album caused many to long for an earlier incarnation of the artist. Old projects like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Care</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing Was the Same</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> set the bar high and left the door open for new releases to be overly scrutinized. Yes, some nostalgia-laden Drake reviews touch on valid points, but as with any bias reporting, viewer discretion is advised, at least to some degree.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is within the macro-level arena that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> evaluations can easily garner positive acclaim. Drake has become a master recording artist as both a singer and a rapper; he delivers contagious melodies and captivating flows. His unmatched versatility as a vocalist allows him to successfully execute multiple styles. From rap to R&amp;B to dancehall, he does it all on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and he does it well. There is a track for everyone, which is a major feat in and of itself. Name another rapper who can achieve such wide-ranging appeal … Now cue the crickets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the irresistibility of Drake’s content is largely due to the holistic quality of his compositions. Executive producer and long-time collaborator 40 delivers a signature OVO sound on a handful of the project’s tracks. Boi-1da, T-Minus and Nineteen85 are a few more usual suspects on the production side of the operation. Within today’s popular music climate, an all-star caliber personnel, like the one backing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, provides the closest thing to a satisfaction guarantee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, whether or not you’re a Drake fanatic, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is certainly worth your attention. But there is a right and wrong way to consume this project. Adopt the macro-level scrutinization mindset and you will not be disappointed. Drake has delivered one of the best collections in recent memory and perhaps the most exciting release of 2017.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/","id":6696,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6695,6694,6693],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
