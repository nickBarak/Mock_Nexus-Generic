Santa Barbara’s 65-47 victory against the Titans was their first road win of the year. In addition, their 65-49 win over CSUN helped UCSB achieve back-to-back conference wins for the first time since the 2012-13 season.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-12, 3-1 in Big West action and has won five of its last six games. Northridge has now lost seven consecutive games, falling to 2-15 overall and 0-3 in conference play following losses to Hawaii and UCSB. Fullerton also sits at 2-15, 0-3 in the Big West after losses to UCSB and Cal Poly, extending its losing streak to 15 games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos’ ballhandling over the two games was most valuable as they finished with a season-low 10 against Fullerton to end their six-game streak of 20-plus turnovers. They followed this performance with a second-best total of 12 at CSUN.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 42.9 three-point percentage against the Matadors marked the third time over its six-game span in which it shot over 40 percent from beyond the arc. It was a shooting clinic for the Gauchos in the first quarter of Saturday’s game as they went 5-6 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>After an early 6-2 lead to open the quarter and an eventual 9-9 tie, the Matadors would go on to trail for the remainder of the game. The abundance of perimeter shots helped UCSB put together a 22-4 scoring run to close out the quarter with a 31-13 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four different Gauchos drained at least one three-point attempt during the run with freshman guard Coco Miller, going 2-2 from long range for her only three-point field goals of the game to finish with 12 points and tied her career-high in steals with a game-high five.</p>\n<p>Another one of those Gauchos was senior guard Jasmine Ware. In just 23 minutes of play, Ware scored a game-high 17 points off the bench on an 8-11 shooting effort to go along with three assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its run in the second quarter with a 7-2 scoring stretch to begin the quarter, forcing a Northridge timeout. CSUN’s 12-4 run led to it trailing 27-45 to enter halftime.</p>\n<p>Despite being down for the entirety of the game, CSUN’s advantage on the boards helped it to remain in the game. It outrebounded UCSB 40-31 as freshman center Channon Fluker recorded a game-high 15 rebounds and guard Cheyenne Allen finished with 11.</p>\n<p>The closest Northridge came within UCSB’s lead was a 12-point deficit of 42-54. Helping CSUN in its comeback attempt was junior guard Emily Cole. Responsible for two of the Matadors’ total of three perimeter shots in the game, Cole led the Matadors in scoring with 14 points.</p>\n<p>Still, CSUN’s edge on the glass would not be enough as UCSB’s consistent scoring offense ended with a 45.8 field goal percentage versus CSUN’s 35.8 shooting percentage. Along with Ware and Miller, sophomore guard Makala Roper (10) and junior center Je zhe Newton (11) finished with double-figures in scoring as UCSB secured its 65-49 victory.</p>\n<p>It was a solid outing for Newton after having her best performance of the season at Cal State Fullerton on Thursday. She set a season-high in scoring with 15 points against the Titans, tallying her third-straight game with double-figures. Newton also had seven rebounds and three blocks on the night.</p>\n<p>It was a quick start to the game by Fullerton, opening with a 5-0 scoring run for the lead. At the helm of the Titans’ swift start was freshman forward Michelle Berry and freshman guard Jade Vega. In spite of her inefficient shooting (6-23), Berry earned a double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds while Vega finished with 11 points.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB responded with a 5-0 run of its own to tie the game up. A 22-13 lead was the Gauchos’ largest lead of the first half, but CSUF persevered with an 8-0 run as UCSB managed to maintain a 26-24 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB held Fullerton to a 32.7 field goal percentage on the night. Most importantly, it limited the Titans’ three-point shot as they shot 27.8 percent from long range. The Gauchos’ defense enhanced their offense as they ended the game shooting 49 percent from the field. Notably, their 58.3 field goal percentage in the second half enabled them to take a substantial lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara outscored Fullerton 39-23 in the final two quarters of the game. It was a breakout half for Ware as she scored 11 of her 13 points in the latter portion of the game on 5-8 shooting. Roper made half of the Gauchos’ three-point field goals to finish with 13 points as well.</p>\n<p>Unable to establish a perimeter presence, Fullerton’s offense was out of sync and could not prevent UCSB from scoring as the Gauchos cruised to a 65-45 win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to end UC Davis’ undefeated conference record (3-0) as it will face the Aggies on Thursday, Jan. 21 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It’s really nice knowing that we have a team with five players that could score one night and five different players who could score the next night.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Valentine led the Gauchos with 16 rebounds while adding eight points and two blocks. The bench posted its second consecutive 23-point effort.</p>\n<p>“Our game plan was to make it hard for their top two scorers tonight,” Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. “Our pressure put them out of a rhythm and they missed a lot of shots early. We executed the game plan well and competed for a full 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held Irvine forward Mikah Maly-Karros and guard Jade Smith-Williams in check throughout the game, holding the duo to 16 points, well below their combined average of 33.</p>\n<p>“It was a phenomenal defensive effort by our team,” Gottlieb said. “Mekia set the tone early and didn’t let [Maly-Karros] get anything easy. She was able to control the game from the start and the rest of the players did a great job helping on the double-team.”</p>\n<p>Irvine was held to under 33 percent shooting on the night, highlighted by Smith-Williams’ two of 10 from the field. The Gauchos shot 51 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“I haven’t been hitting a lot of my shots, especially threes,” Zornig said. “But in this game, I started taking it to the basket more. It felt really good to start hitting those shots out there tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded Irvine by 15 in the game. Sophomore forward Sweets Underwood continued to play well with nine points and six rebounds while filling in for senior forward Margaret Johnson, who has missed the last three games due to an injury.</p>\n<p>However, turnovers continued to be a concern for the Gauchos as they committed a season high of 27.</p>\n<p>“We need to give ourselves a chance to score, and turnovers take away those opportunities.,” Gottlieb said. “Tonight was a situation where it unraveled with the turnovers, but we were able to still win despite not taking care of the ball.”</p>\n<p>After a good night’s rest, the Gauchos will continue the road trip and prepare for another tough opponent, this time facing defending Big West champion UC Riverside. The Highlanders’ record of 9-7 (3-1 in conference) is identical to UCSB’s.</p>\n<p>“I think they are a tough team,” Zornig said. “We need to stop them defensively. We are going to get a game plan going tomorrow, and hopefully it will be effective and we can knock them off because they were Big West champs last year.”</p>\n<p>Riverside is coming off of an 85-67 victory over Long Beach State on Thursday night. Sophomore guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham leads the team with over 10 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The game plan for Riverside is totally different,” Gottlieb said. “We know they are the defending tournament champs and we need to focus on our prep and play with same the same intensity and energy as we did tonight. It’s going to be key for us to control the boards, and clean up the offense obviously, but overall continue to be a lockdown defensive team.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Riverside is scheduled for 5 p.m. on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31697\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31697\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-14/ucsb-upsets-irvine/","id":354,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[353,352,351],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivals Look for First Big West Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos went 3-0 against Cal Poly in 2015, but can they defeat the Mustangs in a hostile road environment with both teams looking for their first conference win?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67354\" style=\"width: 197px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67354\" data-attachment-id=\"67354\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/mbball_vsohio-20151121-dustinharris-2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Gabe Vincent tries to gain control after he slips through some players.

The Mustangs enter with an identical record of 6-8, 0-1, also having lost at Hawai’i last week.</p>\n<p>“We just need to have the same mindset we had during that four-game winning streak. We were focused and playing together and we worked on a couple different things in practice to be more cohesive,” sophomore forward Alex Hart said. “With Cal Poly it’s a rivalry, so I think that’s been fueling the guys in practice this week to take care of that.”</p>\n<p>Last season, UCSB went undefeated in its three games against Cal Poly, including a 54-50 win in the Big West Tournament Quarterfinals. However, none of those wins came in particularly convincing fashion, as the Gauchos managed only a 5.67 average margin of victory, with current leading scorer in senior guard Michael Bryson averaged just eight points in each of those games.</p>\n<p>That average will likely be surpassed tonight, as Bryson has shined as UCSB’s top offensive option so far this season. The 6’4″ guard leads the Big West in scoring at 19.5 points per game, shooting at a highly efficient clip of 47.3 percent from the field, third-best among guards.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for Cal Poly is senior guard David Nwaba, who averages team-highs in points (11.5 ppg), rebounds (5.8 rpg), assists (4.5 apg) and steals (1.64 spg).</p>\n<p>After a slow start to the season for UCSB, reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent has found his shot in recent games, going 15-31 on three-pointers in his last five outings. The sophomore guard backs up Bryson as the team’s second-leading scorer, putting in 12.6 ppg. Vincent ranks fifth in the conference at 2.3 three-point makes per game, hitting 40 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is virtually tied with Cal Poly for sixth in shooting percentage at just under 44 percent, but the Mustangs average the second most points in the conference at 75.4 a game. That mark can be attributed to their taking good care of the ball, averaging a conference-best 10.5 TO per game, as well as their 37.9 percent shooting from deep, which ranks second. On the other side, the Gauchos average just 70.4 ppg and convert 33.7 percent of their threes, both good for seventh in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Further bringing down the UCSB offense is its inability to get to the free throw line. The Gauchos average just 15.2 FTA per game, putting them miles behind conference leader Cal State Fullerton’s average of 25.9.</p>\n<p>“Free throws have been a big thing all year,” Hart said. “I think we’ve been starting to catch up with the rest of the conference though, especially with our guards attacking a lot more, getting to the rim and getting contact. I think we’re on the right track.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ inability to get to the line hurt them down the stretch in their opener against Hawai’i, as they were outshot 13-2 in the second half from the charity stripe in a game that went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>“We need to work on starting the second half strong,” Hart said. “A lot of times, we come out lacking energy. If we come out strong and get off to a good start in the second half it’ll really help us finish out games.”</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Mustangs haven’t fared quite as well from the line, making just 2.78 more free throws per game than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, Cal Poly has struggled, allowing the most points to opponents in the conference at 75.9 per game. The Gauchos meanwhile have been solid when they don’t have possession, ranking third in opponent field goal defense (40.6%)  and second in three-point defense (31%). However, no matter if the offense has been hot or cold this season, Head Coach Bob Williams’ team has continued to emphasize defense and refused to get complacent with its effort.</p>\n<p>“We need to keep making defensive improvements,” Lakoju said. “Offense is something we can improve every day, but if we lock down defensively then our offense should be able to translate.”</p>\n<p>This will be the last of a two-game road trip for the Gauchos before they return home for three straight, starting with UC Irvine this Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal Poly are set to tip-off at 7 p.m. tonight at the Mott Athletics Center in San Luis Obispo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67360\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67360\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/mens-basketball-6/","id":355,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[354,353,352],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Three-Game Streak Ends in 92-81 Loss at UCR, 4-2 in Big West Standings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WBBall-5-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With first-place in the Big West standings on the line, the UCSB women's basketball team was unable to extend its three-game winning streak after a 92-81 loss to UC Riverside on Saturday.

Yet, the Highlanders dominated the paint by outrebounding UCSB 36-19, a season-low for UCSB, and outscored the Gauchos in the paint 44-30.</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders’ interior offense was Rejane Verin. The redshirt junior forward justified her third selection as Big West Player of the Week nearly finishing with a triple-double. Verin registered a game-high 25 points, 16 rebounds and led UCR in assists with seven.</p>\n<p>Four of the Highlanders’ starters finished with double-figures in scoring. In addition to Verin and Curry, senior guards Brittany Crain and Annelise Ito added to UCR nearly matching its season-high of 93 points. Despite just six points in the first half, Crain ended with 23 points while Ito notched 17 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>Riverside’s control of the post became even more advantageous in getting to the free-throw line in which it finished 23-25. UCSB was efficient at the free-throw line as well, but had less attempts making 13-16.</p>\n<p>UCR finished with 10 free-throw attempts in the first quarter, but it was the early production of 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year Michelle Curry that helped the Highlanders gain a double-figure lead. She scored nine of her 15 total points in the opening quarter, making half of the Highlanders’ free-throw attempts as Riverside took an 18-8 lead.</p>\n<p>Ware helped UCSB rally from its 10-point deficit, scoring the Gauchos’ last two field goals from beyond the arc to trim UCR’s lead to 26-21 to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>Neither team could score a basket to open the second quarter as the two registered just one field goal apiece through nearly four minutes of play. Yet, the scoring outburst of Jemerigbe and freshman guard Coco Miller helped UCSB stay within a close margin of the Highlanders’ lead.</p>\n<p>The two accounted for eight of Santa Barbara’s last nine field goals, combining for 16 of the Gauchos’ total of 20 points in the quarter on 7-10 shooting from the field. Miller concluded Saturday’s contest with 18 points while shooting 7-15, 4-10 from behind the three-point line to go along with two steals. Still, UCSB entered halftime down 41-47.</p>\n<p>Riverside increased its lead to 10 in the early minutes of the second half. But a 9-2 UCSB run brought the Gauchos within three at 50-53, forcing a UCR timeout. Santa Barbara came as close as a one-point deficit at 56-57, but could not prevent UCR’s 12-2 run to close out the third quarter with a 69-58 lead.</p>\n<p>After a made free-throw by junior forward Inara Nyingifa, UCR earned its largest lead of 17 points at 78-61. A total of 10 points from Ware helped UCSB in its comeback attempts as a three-pointer by Miller with 4:08 remaining in regulation trimmed the Gauchos’ deficit to seven at 73-80.</p>\n<p>However, the scoring duo of Crain and Verin helped UCR secure its victory as the two combined for 18 points and three steals helping lead the Highlanders to their 92-81 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its road stint with a game at UC Davis on Saturday, Jan. 30 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/ucsbs-three-game-streak-ends-in-92-81-loss-at-ucr-4-2-in-big-west-standings/","id":356,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[355,354,353],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
