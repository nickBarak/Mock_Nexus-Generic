Green and smooth-shelled, brown and bulbous, cream-colored and comma-shaped. Sometimes they are purchased in their original forms, pried from their husks and ingested as is. More often, they team up with other ingredients or shapeshift forms: butters, brittles, candies, extracts, flours, makeup, milk, oils, pastries, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purée</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s, soaps, spreads, syrups and almost anything vegan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve never thought about the ubiquity of peanuts and tree nuts, it’s probably because you don’t have to.

Two bites into a baguette smeared with vegan cream cheese (what did I tell you?), the alarm bells started ringing. All the telltale signs were there: the itchiness on my tongue; the feeling of sand filling my throat as it constricts; my lips going pillowy with numbness; my swollen eyelids reducing my eyes to slits; and worst of all, the panic that sends adrenaline pinballing through my body, drumming up my heart rate and alighting every nerve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I checked the label on the container. Sure enough, the first ingredient listed was “RAW CASHEWS.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A moment of callousness and two bites of cream cheese. That’s all it took to launch my immune system into shutdown and my body into the bathroom, where I spent the next hour with my head in the toilet. This time I got lucky: With the aid of some Benadryl, my breathing returned to normal and the vomiting subsided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a thousand ways this situation could have played out, a thousand parallel universes determined by a single detail. What if I hadn’t been with friends who live minutes away from a drugstore? What if I’d been at a party surrounded by strangers? Or in a foreign country? What if my body went into </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anaphylaxis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I didn’t have my </span><a href=\"https://www.epipen.com/what-is-anaphylaxis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Epi-Pen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with me? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have experienced all of these scenarios in some form or another. From hives at holiday parties to barfing at the beach, I’ve seen it all. So it goes without saying that I am grateful my most recent reaction didn’t land me in the hospital, or worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, a tiny, irrational part of me wishes it did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, there is a disparity — a chasm, really — between the emotional and physical scars left by a traumatic event. Each time, my body outpaces my mind in the recovery process; my eyes de-puff before my tears dry. My allergy is life-threatening, meaning that every time I have a reaction, I am faced with the possibility of my own death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That such a serious medical condition is called an “allergy” strikes me as wildly inappropriate. “Allergy” is a silly word that conjures up images of snot-nosed kids and springtime pollen. It undercuts the terror that seizes me when I realize that something tastes “off.” It makes it difficult for others to empathize with my experiences. No, I don’t live with chronic pain or have to inject myself with medicine on a daily basis. Yes, I am otherwise healthy and able-bodied. But when you live your whole life thinking you could die at any meal, it takes an emotional toll.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, the more drastic the reaction, the easier it is to cope with it. In the wake of a reaction fraught with dramatic details — pastries, Greece, family vacation, deserted island, paramedic tent, no Epi-Pen — I received an outpouring of sympathy from my friends and family. The intensity of their concern matched the misery of the experience. However, this was an exception, not the rule. Reactions that occur under ordinary circumstances, such as Sunday brunch, don’t elicit the same response even though they are no less terrifying for me. This can be extremely isolating, to say the least.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feeling of being heard but not understood makes me want to exaggerate the details of my reactions the way I sometimes embellish stories, a trait at which my friends and family often poke fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck by this as I lay in bed after the Bad Brunch, snapping me out of my post-reaction slump. Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My allergy and I have been attached since birth, our fates tied together by the pad thai noodles that sent me to the hospital at age one. I can’t remember living without it, and </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data indicates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that I probably never will. Which means that for better or worse, my nut allergy is woven into the fabric of my being. If personalities are like smoothies — a random blend of family, culture, DNA and environment — who’s to say it wasn’t a formative ingredient? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some manifestations are positive, highlighting aspects of my personality that may have otherwise remained in the shadows. I was always a precocious child, the kind that enjoyed talking to adults and hogged the camera in all the home videos. Yet my engraved emergency bracelet was my first real taste of the spotlight. I would shake my chubby fist at anyone who would listen, reveling in the attention it garnered me. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I graduated from bracelet-waving to bragging, as if being in constant latent danger was cool. I feel lucky for myself and my parents that I was such an obnoxious kid, never hesitating to announce my allergy to anyone offering me food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also credit my allergy for my Doomsday Prepper tendencies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have to carry a chunky plastic medicine stick and 1-2 tablets of Benadryl with you everywhere, you become one of those people who anticipates disaster at every turn. I have since blossomed into a one-woman drugstore, never without band-aids, floss, tampons or gum on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with a severe allergy also prematurely exposed me to some dark truths. The most heartbreaking lesson of childhood is that your parents can’t protect you from everything</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I learned this early on. Proactive and careful as they were, my parents couldn’t be there every time there was an incident. In fact, they were the accidental perpetrators of a few reactions. To chalk up my neuroses and distrust of adults to a nut allergy might seem, well, nuts, but it can’t be dismissed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else? No. Can I imagine my life without it? Strangely, also no.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s part of who I am, for better or worse. The disadvantages of a fatal allergy are obvious.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They read like the side effects delivered in hyperspeed at the end of a commercial: nausea, vomiting, swelling, redness, anaphylaxis, death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the upsides? I am long past the point of considering attention one of them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o amount of pity or compassion can counteract the trauma or resulting isolation. Moreover, I do not subscribe to the “everything happens for a reason” theory </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s disrespectful toward the victims of senseless tragedies and frankly, it’s bullshit. Some clouds are gray without a touch of silver. Some lemons are just meant to be lemons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet despite the drawbacks, having a severe allergy has gifted me with an alternative perspective on my own life. Along with all of the other timelines by which we organize our lives </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationships, family pets, schools, career milestones </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exists my personal history of reactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The details surrounding these incidents are forever vivid in my mind: the holiday decor at the Christmas Party where I ate white chocolate walnut fudge at age nine; the sunlight and rolling green hills at my second grade field trip, crumbs glinting off the knife that had been used to cut a peanut butter cookie moments before; the security of my mom’s hand around mine when she picked me up from kindergarten after a classmate’s birthday cake made me sick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While allergic reactions make for unpleasant memories, they go hand in hand with special moments that I wouldn’t recall otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is, however, one definitive benefit of having a deathly allergy: It gives people a way to show that they care about you. There’s a line in “Lady Bird” that goes, “Don’t you think they’re the same thing? Love and attention?” In this case, I think they are. Considering how nuts are exceedingly normal and harmless for about 95% of the population, a person needs a reason to care about their presence. I am that reason for my loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time someone takes extra precautions to ensure my safety, I feel like they’ve just handed me a present. Like when my friend Samantha insists on asking the waiter if the pizza we ordered has nuts, even though I’ve read the menu twice and pizza never has nuts, idiot. Or when my aunt Millie hands me the bowl of sweet potatoes that she personally prepares for me every Thanksgiving. It’s not just that my people look out for me; it’s that I never have to ask. They’ve already thought of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the time, living with this condition is perfectly manageable. Unlike many people, I’m fortunate to have a support system that includes access to medical treatment in case of an emergency. As of this moment, no cure has been found, though I’m sure it won’t be long now (and when it is, it’ll probably be </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-mylan-epipen-drug-prices-20180605-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outrageously expensive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else?

The first paragraph on the page explains that with exposure to different cultures all around the world comes different views on gender and sexuality — views that might radically diverge from our own. There is a </span><a href=\"https://eap.ucsb.edu/getting-started/lgbtq-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this paragraph that I especially like, and I commend whoever wrote it. It says, “When you venture out in the world, you carry your identity with you even if it is not readily apparent to those around you. Going abroad can therefore represent a second ‘coming out’, and you will need to make decisions about how and when to express your LGBTQ identity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a very thoughtful way to say, “as a queer person, not all countries are safe for you.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scroll a little further and you’ll find “</span><a href=\"https://eap.ucsb.edu/getting-started/lgbtq-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk Levels and Risk Mitigation Strategies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This is the first thing that any queer person considering going abroad should look at. Included is a link to a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uJKCx7Zn_HGF4QNjW4FzAUEmkYHlzXyOCdu1Zp5kGY/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Doc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a country by country breakdown. In this breakdown each country is labeled either “very safe,” “mostly safe,” “unsafe” and “very unsafe,” with some being “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” They also go on to define qualities that make “extreme risk,” “high risk” or “moderate risk” countries. Quick spoiler alert: Of the 39 countries listed, only two get the coveted title of “very safe” (Canada and Argentina).   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before coming across this very valuable document, I had spoken to a UCEAP peer advisor. I told her that I was interested in maybe going to a country in Africa. She was very kind and helpful and informed me that there are more scholarship opportunities for certain countries because they tend to have fewer applicants. She suggested Ghana, since she had studied there herself and loved it. After discovering the country-by-country risk breakdown, I looked up Ghana and found out it is considered “unsafe” for LGBTQ folks, as there are “explicit restrictions on LGBTIA+ expression &amp; rights,” and “governmental &amp; societal treatment is poor.” Okay, so maybe not Ghana. But this must be an exception, right? Surely there can’t be many study abroad options that are unsafe for so many students at this school?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After nixing Ghana, I did a bit more research and found a summer internship abroad opportunity in South Africa. It sounded interesting and relevant to my future, so I decided to check out its risk level:  “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” Yes! This was a win. South Africa it is. After all, it says queer PDA </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lead to violence and tension, as opposed to Russia where it says queer PDA is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to cause violence and tension, or in Ghana where male-male relationships could lead to imprisonment for 10 or more years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why am I so excited about what feels like less than the bare minimum? I’d much prefer a place that’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> safe. Not neutral. While it’s a better option than Russia, Barbados, Tanzania, Jordan, Senegal or Indonesia — all of which are considered high-risk countries — I’d still prefer to study in a place where I can be sure my identity won’t endanger me if it comes up in conversation. So can I go to South Africa? The answer is yes, but I’m still scared. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m grateful to have this list, because I’m sure there was a time when it didn’t exist at all. I’m grateful that I have the information I need to keep myself safe, but there is still something so scary about it. This list is a reminder to me that so much of the world still doesn’t accept this community. The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world. When I sing along in the shower to Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan or Frank Ocean, I feel seen and heard, but there are so many people who cannot feel seen or heard because they are afraid for their lives. I can proudly go see Trixie Mattel at a school-sponsored event and know that I am surrounded by literally hundreds of other students who couldn’t care less whether or not I like girls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, other times, I’m afraid too. Sometimes I get nervous holding my girlfriend’s hand when I find myself travelling outside of my bubble. I wonder what the risk level is for the United States — depending on where you are, the answer may change. Even California, a place that most would consider pretty safe for minorities, has 83 hate groups as of 2018 — </span><a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map/by-state\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than any other U.S. state. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice to other LGBTQ students out there considering studying abroad: Do your research and utilize the resources available to us. I long for the day when we don’t have to worry about our physical safety when making decisions like this and when I can browse naively, as I did when the world was my oyster. I know that I don’t “look” queer, and many foreign laws around homosexuality are targeted at men so, in theory, I could still go to Ghana or Russia and probably be fine. But the fact remains that the world is not my oyster, because no class credit is worth going back in the closet. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes safe travels to all the global Gauchos out there.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Hebrew school was a place where I met other people like me: kids whose families celebrated Shabbat on Fridays, whose ancestors also came to America fleeing the horrors of World War II, who wanted to party it up at their own bar or bat mitzvahs in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience was unique in that I was brought up in a reformed sect of Judaism, one that explored how traditional ideas could be reexamined in a modern context. At Hebrew school, whether making crafts celebrating the Jewish holidays or in song sessions with the cantor, we were always encouraged to ask questions. As we got older, this extended to encouragement to question the texts we were learning about. There was a surprising amount of recognition that parables written thousands of years ago could reasonably be considered outdated today. The emphasis was always on taking from Judaism what you wanted. Nothing was strictly imposed on us except for good morals and the occasional splash of Zionism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s right: Pro-Israel rhetoric ran forcefully through the underlying messages of my generally progressive temple on a regular basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In seventh grade, we learned about the Jewish holy sites in Israel but not about the complicated histories of bloody political conflicts that gave us access to them. In eighth grade, we learned about the Israeli Defense Forces, but nothing about who they were fighting against. And in my high school confirmation class, we sat through PowerPoint presentations highlighting the incredible success of Israel’s recent technological advances without any reference to their equally fast-growing weapons technology.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never once was there any mention of Palestine. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is visiting this country with an organization like Birthright Israel endorsing a political view that I do not hold? </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the United States was actually </span><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/us-israel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the first nations to recognize Israel’s sovereignty </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in 1948 and has remained a steadfast ally since then. While this alliance may have devolved from a moral stance into something more akin to a strategic asset, positive relations between the U.S. and Israel have remained surprisingly constant throughout the turbulent histories of both countries. The United States has also historically played a significant role as a mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, a role that has increasingly favored Israel as a result of the budding love affair between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two make quite the couple. Where previous Democratic American presidents have pushed Netanyahu to consider a two-state solution, the Israeli Prime Minister has </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/825371795972825089?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he can now trade ideas on voter suppression and the building of walls with our current President. Both fond of </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/the-trump-netanyahu-alliance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bullying members of the press and unwilling to engage</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in negotiation with Palestine, it comes as no surprise that both leaders appeal to the racists and absolutists of the right wings of their respective countries. Both have been served multiple </span><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/01/28/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-on-charges-of-bribery-fraud-and-breach-of-trust-2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indictment charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Trump for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and Netanyahu for breach of trust — in their respective nations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To consummate their blossoming relationship, it seems that Trump believes that he and Jared Kushner can single handedly succeed where almost a century of diplomatic relations surrounding Israel and Palesine could not. While confidently boasting to have finally found a viable path to a Palestinian state, this claim only distracts from further disregard for Palestinian rights. </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/28/21111890/trump-israel-palestine-peace-plan-deal-century-apartheid\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s so-called “peace plan”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> concedes to labeling Palestine a state as it continues to cement its dependence on Israel. Trump’s proposal divides up Palestinian territories and surrounds them with Israeli ones, essentially giving Israel total security and economic control over Palestinian lands and rendering any Palestinian government powerless. Since its proposal, the plan has largely been </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-most-immediate-unexpected-threat-of-trumps-middle-east-peace-plan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">viewed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a call for Israel to annex the West Bank territory, but no action has been taken yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Israel-Palestine conflict continues to escalate, I find that despite any hypothetical connection to Israel that my Jewish identity might encompass, I remain utterly repulsed by its government’s repeated aggressions as an occupying power, as well as the actions of “my own country” in support of this abuse of power. I have been openly and loudly critical of President Trump, and now I’m starting to recognize that his actions are being mirrored by Prime Minister Netanyahu. While many liberal American Jews don’t think twice about criticizing the various horrific actions of our President, they are reluctant to extend the same criticism to Israel’s Prime Minister because of the link between Judaism and Israel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This link is largely perpetuated by the idea that Israel exists as a Jewish birthright. Birthright, under the guise of being an apolitical educational experience, largely promotes Israeli military propaganda and ignores any Palestinian narratives about the reality of life under Israeli military rule. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This program ignores the current reality of occupation, features various pro-Israel speakers and conveniently avoids bringing young Jews to the West Bank.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jewish claim to Israel is at best a questionable one. In reality, the </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/the-meaning-of-nakba-israel-palestine-1948-gaza/560294/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">land was won in a brutal series of wars</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that repeatedly displaced and exiled the indigenous population of Palestinians. This history is intentionally ignored by the glorified education experience that Birthright provides. This program ignores the current reality of occupation, features various pro-Israel speakers and conveniently avoids bringing young Jews to the West Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recently added staple of the Birthright experience is what the organization calls a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/where-birthright-went-wrong/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mega Event,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which can only be described as a glorified propaganda show. Modeled after music festivals, the event is headlined by popular Israeli bands and is put on specifically for the participants of Birthright. However, the event is funded primarily by pro-Israel billionaires, including Las Vegas tycoon Sheldon Adelson. That’s right, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/12/14/sheldon-adelson-trump-macau/#2554f58021c7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of Trump’s largest donors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout his 2016 election is also funding Birthright.

By supporting Birthright, these are the people and political messages you are endorsing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What once was universally viewed as a Jewish rite of passage has now become a source of protest. Participants in Birthright are now beginning to </span><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-young-jews-walk-off-birthright-trip-to-join-anti-occupation-activity-1.6271943\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walk off the trip</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in protest of the lack of attention it pays to the realities of Israeli occupation. This is the beginning of a more modern resistance that refuses to let Jewish identity be manipulated for the Israeli government’s political motives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birthright does not build Jewish community. It encourages blind faith to an oppressive state and right-wing regime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I refuse to be the same kind of “progressive” that the temple of my childhood unwittingly perpetuated </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the convenient kind of progressive.

I’m not really sure there is another campus in the world that can replicate the bubble of seclusion and charm that our one square mile of duplexes provides. However, since the day I graduated from high school, there has been a growing sense of restlessness that I can only attribute to my inner need to be doing something substantial with all the time I am allocated on this earth. While I appreciate the perks of studying in such an environment (our school is on a goddamn beach with skies that provide their own Instagram filters), I can’t help but feel my life has stagnated due to the bubble in which I.V. resides. There are only so many Sands Beach sunsets and die tossings before the shine begins to lose its luster. I may not have verbally expressed this, but as I left UCSB, part of me was hoping that I wouldn’t come back to campus.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85239\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85239\" data-attachment-id=\"85239\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=85239\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=650%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85239\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?resize=650%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85239\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A change of pace was needed, and I jumped at the chance to move to London: a city that is much larger and much more diverse than where I had resided for the past two years. And I love it. It’s loud. There is no time to pause and take a breath. People in suits, tracksuits and puffy jackets bustle in and out of every little corner imaginable. Sarcasm oozes from many of its inhabitants. For the first time, I don’t feel like a wandering entity unable to find something worth latching onto. I feel as if I am a functioning cog in a machine much bigger than I can comprehend. It might sound contradictory with my need for importance, but I enjoy the anonymity that comes with living in a city with more than eight million people. I can write my own story without the shackles of familiarity combined with preconceived notions of myself and life itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And write my own story I have, as I have dived into things I have been too scared to dive into before, participated in things I can’t participate in back home and explored places I only dreamed of exploring. I can safely say there is no place on earth I’d rather be in this current moment. I can’t imagine anyone becoming disenchanted with this place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are exceptions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why on earth would you leave California for here?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The weather alone is going to leave you clinically depressed by mid-November.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s great and all, I get it, but this place is exhausting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as I had become disillusioned with the vibrant sunshine and peaceful bike rides back home, these people I encountered had experienced the same fatigue with their environment as I had, despite the vast difference in lifestyles the two settings provide.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They, too, were unsettled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I thought about it, it made sense. Despite my own beliefs in my societal integration, I am still a foreigner purposely seeking out the good in an environment I am excited to be present in. The cons of annoyances have not settled in due to the fact that it is very new to me and that “very new” is exactly what I’m seeking. What was my boredom back home was someone else’s rare chance to simmer down and calm their busy brain. I had complete access to a world they don’t usually experience, and they couldn’t process why I would leave it. Their home was to me what mine was to them. We shared the exact same feelings. Who’s to say the same wouldn’t happen to me if I stayed here? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grass is always greener on the other side” is an overused and cliche saying, but it rings true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this desire to grow up fast while still working out the kinks of immaturity a healthy combination? What’s to tell me these times at UCSB aren’t the “good old days” that I’ll remember fondly in 15 years? Am I moving too fast while wanting to go even faster?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on this, I couldn’t help being drawn to a particular thought. Everytime I come home to my hometown, exiting the 280 freeway, this wave of calmness and comfort washes over me. As I weave through the hills and watch the sunlight trickle through familiar trees and neighborhoods, I can’t help but think fondly back to the memories and feelings I associate with the place. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be a fleeting feeling before my desire to leave eventually takes over, but the comfort my hometown provides is always there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m only 20 years young, and I am not sure if I’m ready to fully leave that comfort behind. I’m close. But not just yet. The world is a large place, and I intend to inhabit as much of it as possible. My London experience in itself has been more than I could have ever asked for. But these places are not going anywhere; I’ve got a little bit of time. I’ve got a life back home I still need to take care of. A crisp and sudden break is not a fitting end for my first two years of college. For the first time in my life, I should attempt to actively enjoy slowing down. Maybe it’s OK to “gather my rosebuds while I may” for a little bit longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2019, I will be back in Isla Vista. There is no guarantee I won’t fall right back into the funk of a routine I had become accustomed to. But with the potential experiences and future I now know lie ahead of me, I trust myself to acknowledge the bigger picture that life has painted for me. This is one chapter of a longer story. With that in mind, I think I’ll be OK enjoying the ride and sitting back while watching that damn beautiful Sands Beach sunset for the next 18 months. After all, I do want to graduate on time.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Karamdashti is learning that a little familiarity is okay.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-02-20-at-9.56.21-AM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kian Karamdashti</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kian Karamdashti is an Opinion and Nexustentialism staff writer.
