","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that epic kiss between Madonna and Britney Spears at the 2003 VMAs to Katy Perry’s 2008 hit “I Kissed a Girl,” straight artists have been using the taboo of same-sex relationships to cause a stir among audiences, and, unfortunately, we have not left this trend in the 2000s. Music artists have been “queerbaiting” for a while now, and the LGBTQ+ community is not happy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently, Ariana Grande is the artist who is a prime example of this dynamic: Her recent music video for “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored” and her headlining of the Manchester Pride celebration this upcoming August have received plenty of criticism from the LGBTQ+ community. However, Grande is consistently open about her support and love for the queer community, so what’s the big deal here? What </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">queerbait, is Grande guilty of it and why are people mad about it? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her music video for “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored,” Grande flirts with another woman, and the two lean in for a kiss that is never realized, as right then, the video ends, and the imagery suggests that the singer wants the couple to break up so that she may be with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not the man. This would be an adorable twist if Ariana was actually a member of the queer community, but presumably, she is not. Apparently, the video is meant to relay a message of self-love: The other woman was Ariana all along, and Ariana is celebrating herself. But this is never made clear in the video itself. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ambiguity is a prime example of “queerbaiting” — people in the public eye hinting at same-sex relationships, either in their personal lives or in their work, without confirming their actual “queerness,” therefore attracting gay fans while avoiding the discrimination that these fans face everyday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People are angry when straight musicians like Ariana Grande depict same-sex relationships and they are perceived as fun, flirty and harmless by vast audiences. In real life, queer teens are still being called slurs in school halls, trans people are assaulted for their identities and gay couples still worry about what will happen if they hold hands in public. Queerbait is straight artists utilizing the shock factor of gay relationships for attention, without providing any real representation or advocacy for LGBTQ+ fans. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86743\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1320652399\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86742\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86743\" data-attachment-id=\"86743\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=2048%2C1510&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1510\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-966939330-1549449240\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=888%2C655&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86743\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=888%2C655\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"655\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=768%2C566&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=1024%2C755&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86743\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Getty Images</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grande will also be headlining the Manchester Pride festival this August. It is a sentimental moment, as she is returning to the city where the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing occured, and she will be representing a community that she obviously cares deeply for. However, regardless of her intentions, her name dominating a lineup meant to showcase queer talent, overshadowing the names of other performers, doubling ticket prices and attracting waves of fans —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whether they are allies to the queer community or not —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is extremely problematic. Pride festivals are meant to be safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people of all ages and backgrounds, but tickets will likely go to those who are willing to pay the highest prices to see their idols, not to people who desperately need a place to feel accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariana Grande is not the only musician who has ever been accused of stealing a spotlight that belongs to a queer artist, but with her millions of fans and followers, her influence cannot go unnoticed. It did not go unnoticed when two straight women kissed on national television, only for cameras to immediately turn to see the reaction of Spears’s ex-boyfriend. It did not go unnoticed when Katy Perry sang about hoping her “boyfriend don’t mind it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LGBTQ+ love is not a circus feat, it is not something to be gawked at and it is certainly not something to be appropriated by those who will never face the struggles that come with actually being a member of the queer community. Grande and all other straight artists can certainly be allies, but they cannot claim to support their queer following while using same-sex attraction as a music video prop, or taking up performance space that should belong to queer artists. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/","id":6270,"author":{"id":765,"name":"Adeline Barron-Merritt"},"related":[6269,6268,6267],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":765,"name":"Adeline Barron-Merritt","biography":"Not available","articles":[6270],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"An I.V.

Since then we’ve embraced and encouraged that vibe.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, their set was loud as hell, and a few naysayers took issue with the noise. Some people just cannot appreciate good metal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of Artsweek’s own have had the pleasure of witnessing the magic happen firsthand on more than one occasion, and the crowds speak for themselves. Free booze, heavy metal and boatloads of energy, in that particular order, is always enough to get even the lazy and lethargic on their feet. But Noise Complaint goes above and beyond the average band of mediocre musicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did I mention the free booze? That’s right. Coors galore. Every head in the pit is justifiably banging to the hardcore beats of heavy metal as soon as Matthew Hernandez rips his first lick on bass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What separates this crew from the rest is pure, white-hot dedication. Jake and his bandmates were setting up their stage, their equipment and the pit as early as 2 p.m. for their latest gig — around eight gut-wrenching hours before the show was set to begin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our worst shows are other people’s best,” one member modestly said. But it’s true — the group clearly puts everything they have into creating the best possible experience for their crowds at every show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We seriously give it our all and the audience ends up genuinely loving it,” Anvari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band jokingly compares themselves to Migos, whom we all know and love, and as far as raw talent and passion goes, that stretch isn’t far from the truth. A more accurate resemblance might be found between Noise Complaint and Linkin Park, whom the former often looks to for cover songs and inspiration. While these comparisons certainly help paint a legendary picture, Noise Complaint is uniquely their own, and they make sure you know it as they grind out every set list with a grit that belongs to the pros. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking for a slow, easy night indoors, maybe this isn’t the scene for you. Then again, even notorious heavy metal haters who generally don’t connect with hardcore rock ‘n’ roll reportedly show up time and time again to get that metal buzz, feeding off the energy of the fans and the band. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more info on Noise Complaint’s upcoming shows, be sure to like and follow them on

Out of this desire came “Wolves,” a blistering, rocked-out anthem that encourages women not to withhold their ambitions because of anyone else. “It’s about how no matter what you do or what you say or wear, you are doing it for yourself… And there’s a whole squadron of women standing behind you,” said Feldman.</p>\n<p>Performing the song with her band BNTLY, “Wolves” became a crucial piece in helping the group land a distribution deal with Bungalow and Universal. Now, with shows planned around established clubs across Los Angeles and five more singles coming out this year, BNTLY is quickly emerging as band that’s here to stay.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82532\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"102983688\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82531\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82532\" data-attachment-id=\"82532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82532\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/24173688_534949996870750_3538095345550671698_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of BNTLY</p></div>\n<p>Yet, BNTLY and feminist activism only make up a portion of Feldman’s activities. In addition to writing and performing music, Feldman is a passionate environmental studies major at UCSB. She is currently an intern at the sustainability program on campus, leading the organization efforts of the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, which will host thousands of students from college campuses around the country later this year. Additionally, Feldman runs a blog discussing fashion and how it relates to sustainability and health. Although music is Feldman’s first priority, she is open to pursuing environmental activism as a backup career.</p>\n<p>This work ethic and diversity of interests does not go unnoticed: “Julia is a mixture of warmth, love, generosity and compassion while also being one of the most determined, focused and hardworking people I know,” said housemate and third-year art major Pilar Herrera. “She is a glass-half-full kind of lady and isn’t easily discouraged.”</p>\n<p>This view is echoed by her brother and BNTLY guitarist Adam Feldman. “She has always been able to multitask at a high level, and it’s no surprise that she is able to handle school, work, music and life, period. That’s just always been Julia,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The children of a singing and accordion-playing mother and a multi-talented musician of a father with ties to the industry<u>,</u> the Feldman children began their musical education in the Valley of Los Angeles from a young age. “[Our parents] decided that my brother and I would learn an instrument no matter what,” said Julia. “They started us with guitar, but then I found out I could sing, so I really took off with that while Adam took off with guitar.”</p>\n<p>Naturally, the two began writing songs together. When Adam was 13 and Julia 11, the two started sitting down together to collaborate. What started out as a way to kill time at home quickly progressed into a serious hobby within the first year. Years later they’ve refined their writing process, collaborating as the main songwriters for BNTLY.</p>\n<p>“Our process is super organic. No frills, no nothing,” said Adam. “One of us has an idea, whether it be melodic or lyrical, and we just build the song from the ground up, lyrics and music at the same time so they fit perfectly.”</p>\n<p>Listening to BNTLY, this process can be easily traced. On “Wolves,” Julia’s soulful vocals weave around the same melody as Adam’s roaring, wah-wah guitar riff. Adding tricky licks and vocal runs, Adam and Julia add a layer of complexity to the seemingly rudimentary foundation of the song.</p>\n<p>The Feldman siblings also credit their musical prowess to their father’s teachings on various musical genres. “He would drive around and give us little music history lessons,” said Julia. “We would start out in the ’60s with classic rock, blues and funk.” Julia acknowledges that these early lessons helped her hone the style of her biggest influences, which include Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder and Sly and the Family Stone.</p>\n<p>Adam also believes that the fact that Julia wasn’t just focused on vocally driven pop music is what makes her so fun to listen to and collaborate with. “She understands that she is a part of a larger entity, making for a much more cohesive sound over all,” Adam elaborated. “It is a type of musical maturity that some vocalists never get to in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Constantly exploring new ways to empower women and improve her abilities as a singer, Julia is looking to diversify her influences by looking at more female performers. Julia has taken a liking to neo-soul and praises the work of the female artists Kehlani, H.E.R., NAO and Lianne La Havas. Julia has even made a point of covering female artists in Isla Vista including a scathing rendition of Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” with her old band Poster Child.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82533\" style=\"width: 1090px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"738330862\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82531\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82533\" data-attachment-id=\"82533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=1080%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82533\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26678501_555654538133629_810771039100557526_o-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82533\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of BNTLY</p></div>\n<p>While two of the band members of Poster Child have since graduated and moved to San Francisco and Los Angeles to begin professions in chemistry and accounting respectively, Julia fondly recalls the Isla Vista music scene. “One time spring quarter we played at my drummer Shane’s backyard on DP. We pushed two beer die tables up against the fence, and that was the stage,” said Julia. “We used to pack his backyard with people, and others from the street would come and listen. I talk to friends who go to college in other places, and they can’t do anything like that.”</p>\n<p>It is likely, however, that Julia’s passion for music and her endeavors in environmental justice and gender equality might not be able to co-exist forever. “It is interesting hearing about how her busy-ness is split between two different identities, that of a student and that of an aspiring musician,” said Herrera. “For how much she is doing, and given that I see a lot of the behind-the-scenes-Julia, her work ethic and positive attitude are seriously so impressive.”</p>\n<p>Despite constantly seeming to exhibit this positivity, even Julia feels the pressure of the future. “I’m so scared that I’m going to wake up when I’m 30 and have this job that I don’t care about and just be like, ‘Oh my god what happened?’”</p>\n<p>For now, Julia has one primary goal, common through each of her interests: She wants to make a change. “I feel some of the heavy shit in the world,” she said. “I just want to have a purpose and leave a mark in a positive way.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/julia-feldman-wants-to-make-a-mark/","id":6268,"author":{"id":666,"name":"Daniel Carroll"},"related":[6267,6266,6265],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Misogyny Masquerades as Entertainment: Looking at Today’s Rap & Hip Hop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2019-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"What has made it so normalized for rappers, who lead today’s most popular musical genre, to generalize and sexualize women as much as they desire?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“You’re such a fuckin’ ho, I love it”</em> –<strong> Kanye West</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“She just bought a new ass but got the same boobs”</em> – <strong>Migos</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“New freak, had to cut my other lil’ bitch off”</em> – <strong>Rich the Kid</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“Fuck his baby mama, tryna sneak diss.

Women become the object of an image that these rappers frame, and their listeners are completely desensitized to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What has made it so normalized for rappers, who lead today’s most popular musical genre, to generalize and sexualize women as much as they desire? </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first heard Chance the Rapper’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 Day</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and then a year later </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acid Rap</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, hip hop was the genre that I continued to fall in love with. By the time I was in high school, I was digging through SoundCloud looking for new rappers in a very male-dominated space of music. I stumbled upon some of my favorite rappers like Kanye West, GoldLink and Kid Cudi, all of whom still remain among my most beloved musicians. I was a teenagr listening to women being called “hoes,” but it somehow didn’t matter to me —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it was just a part of the norm of a genre that I </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chose</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be interested in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I frequently attend rap concerts when I get the chance. The room, mostly filled with men, chant in unison: “I fuck yo bitch for the irony.” And, without thinking, I sing along to these lyrics as well. That’s something that likely won’t ever change and it’s part of the fun of it for me, despite how unorthodox it sounds.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86745\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1247827925\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86744\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86745\" data-attachment-id=\"86745\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/when-misogyny-masquerades-as-entertainment-looking-at-todays-rap-hip-hop/nehahiphop-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?fit=2000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"nehahiphop-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86745 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01-250x250.png?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nehahiphop-01.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86745\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as a woman myself, am I a part of the issue? Should I be condemning the lyrical weaponry of almost every contemporary rapper and stand up for the rights that women deserve and are fighting for in our society? Am I a part of the perpetual cycle of objectification by allowing men to demean women and bolster their masculinity in the world of hip hop? I’m not entirely sure why I happily listen to this music while dismissing the way men talk about women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hip hop is just supposed to be tough, right? The more badass you are the more you fit in — even the most revered of figures, Dr. Dre, has rapped about his aggression toward women. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yo, I tied her to the bed, I was thinking the worst / But yo, I had to let my n*ggas fuck her first, yeah / Loaded up the forty-fo’, yo/Then I straight smoked the ho,” he raps in N.W.A’s “One Less Bitch.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now, up-and-coming rappers who are molding a new era of rap, such as Kodak Black and Famous Dex, continue this detrimental image of women and have also been accused of abuse in their personal lives. All the while, these artists maintain millions of streams and vastly large fanbases – ones that even include those who fight for women’s rights and equality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women have always been a central focus of degenerative rap lyrics. Rappers are constantly telling women how to present themselves or act to their pleasure, portraying women as solely objects of their sexual gratification and depicting them as nothing more than “gold diggers” and “cheaters.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kendrick Lamar, one of the most cherished rappers, has been criticized for saying, “Show me somethin’ natural like ass with some stretch marks.” While giving attention to natural female aesthetics other rappers dismiss, he continues to set certain expectations for women and instruct them how to express themselves to fit his own desire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hegemonic structure of hip hop has always made assertive the hyper-masculinity present to any listener. This cycle persists as men try to fit in with others by treating women as a marginality in the world of rap. Here, violence and mistreatment are OK. It’s OK to mumble slanders of how women are nothing more than vehicles for sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, being a man meant being powerful: having the most women, money and drugs. And it was difficult to move beyond this trend. Rap has now stretched so far past this, yet we still hold rappers’ words about women to the same standards as we did before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, female rappers, who are already quite marginalized in this genre, seemingly play to the hyper-sexuality that male rappers depict women to have. From my perspective, Cardi B and Nicki Minaj, two of the most known female rappers of this generation, play into this trope. Instead of helping other women in the genre, they reinforce the idea of the limited female space in rap and have even gotten into physical and verbal fights with each other. This disappoints me, as these talented female rappers are overshadowing the beauty of having women in rap in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women should have an expanded space in rap music, and women should support each other in the genre instead of allowing for male domination to continue. In the past, when I heard unfavorable lyrics in rap music, I did not take it personally, as it just seemed like an established right for men to disrespect women in this context. I now think there should be a change in what is considered acceptable. Young girls should not be listening to their favorite rappers call women “hoes” and their favorite songs shouldn’t be about “bitches.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, Famous Dex, Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar were all in my Spotify 2018 top streamed songs playlist. And honestly, that probably won’t change next year. By listening to these artists, I am not supporting rappers’ misogyny. Instead, I hope and advocate for change while still appreciating rap music as my favorite genre.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/when-misogyny-masquerades-as-entertainment-looking-at-todays-rap-hip-hop/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/when-misogyny-masquerades-as-entertainment-looking-at-todays-rap-hip-hop/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/when-misogyny-masquerades-as-entertainment-looking-at-todays-rap-hip-hop/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/when-misogyny-masquerades-as-entertainment-looking-at-todays-rap-hip-hop/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/when-misogyny-masquerades-as-entertainment-looking-at-todays-rap-hip-hop/","id":6269,"author":{"id":661,"name":"Neha Makkapati"},"related":[6268,6267,6266],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
