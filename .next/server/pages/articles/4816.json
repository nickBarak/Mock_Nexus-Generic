During the meeting, GSA representatives also said it is essential the association hold regular monthly meetings concerning issues surrounding I.V. that are open to public input and discussion.</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Student Affairs Jason Hopkins, a Ph.D. candidate in the sociology department, said the first step to having graduate students become more involved in I.V. involves determining what the I.V. residents want from graduate students through a some form of assessment of I.V. residents’ needs. </p>\n<p>“We need to take concrete action steps to make a lot of our ideas realized,” Hopkins said. “If we are going to do things that are a little bit more involved and impactful, it would be important to know what the students want. There are over three-thousand grad students that want something to do.”</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Committees and Planning Matt Sayball, a Ph.D. candidate in the philosophy department, said graduate students should help support local small businesses and break certain norms that accompany being a teacher’s assistant, such as refraining from reaching out to I.V. residents. </p>\n<p>“Grad students live like homeless people in Isla Vista,” Sayball said. “It’s a cool place. It’s funky and it’s got freedom of expression to it that people associate to the UC system and California. We need to support that however we can.”</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of External Affairs Yanira Rivas Pineda, a Ph.D. candidate in the department of political science, led the meeting and said her biggest concern is that by taking action the GSA might offend someone or encroach on the lives of I.V. residents. </p>\n<p>“We want to be more present in Isla Vista, but we have to be really careful,” Pineda said. “We can’t treat the residents there as test subjects for our research.”</p>\n<p>According to Shari Sanders, a Ph.D. candidate in the comparative literature department, GSA should take steps to have more of a presence in Isla Vista. </p>\n<p>“We should go to the more meetings and say hey, we’re GSA representatives and we plan to be more active in the community,” Sanders said. </p>\n<p>Hopkins also said he had specific ideas about actions GSA can take to improve Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We need to print bilingual fliers to give to the residents of Isla Vista and try to make parking more accessible by providing parking permits.”</p>\n<p>Hopkins also said he hopes to see specific improvements made to the GSA website to further promote graduate students’ involvement with I.V. by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the year we should see a volunteer corps that publicly announces what different organizations need so graduate students can help provide those services,” Hopkins said. “By the end of the year, I’d like to see the GSA website have a list of these organizations.”</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, GSA should hold more social events increase graduate student presence in I.V. </p>\n<p>“I think a lot of graduate students feel like outsiders,” Pineda said. “We’re isolated. The more you experience I.V., the more you’ll care and want to help out.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article quoted Sanders as saying “We need to print bilingual fliers to give to the residents of Isla Vista and try to make parking more accessible by providing parking permits.” Sanders did not say this. The statement was actually made by Jason Hopkins.

Part of the drafting process for this law will involve I.V. community input. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div><br>\nThe League of Women Voters of Santa Barbara hosted a community forum titled the “The Future of Isla Vista — An Ongoing Conversation” yesterday at the Louise Lowry Davis Center to discuss the recent findings and goals of a report released by the UCSB Foundation Trustees’ Advisory Committee, including efforts for self-governance and other proposed remedies for improving Isla Vista. \n<p>The League of Women Voters provided brown bag lunches and opened up the event to the public to pose questions to I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District General Manager Rodney Gould, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming, Acting Chief Deputy of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office Sam Gross and Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk. Topics included concerns regarding I.V. culture, forms of government, student activities and community development. </p>\n<p>Schunk said the lack of a government body dedicated to managing I.V. remains a significant contributor to I.V.’s various problems, though there have been three different attempts to establish such bodies in 1972, 1975 and 1985. </p>\n<p>“In 1972, there was actually legislation passed called the Isla Vista Campus Community Services District, however, that legislation was never voted into law, because the community felt incorporation was on the horizon. So why create a district when we are just going to be a city?’” Schunk said. “I think we can all see how that turned out.” </p>\n<p>According to Schunk, establishing a special legislative district as a form of self-governance requires the approval of the Land Agency Formation Committee for Santa Barbara (LAFCO), who recommended the county assist in establishing the district. LAFCO, a state agency existing in every county in California, helps citizens, counties, cities and special districts work on issues concerning jurisdictional change.  </p>\n<p>“They told us to approach the legislation with this, as they would better be able to tailor-make a solution for you and would be better able to work with you on what you do and don’t want to see in that legislation,” Schunk said. </p>\n<p>Schunk said the Special Legislative District would make governing decisions in I.V. such as approving additional taxes to operate the area as well as providing appropriate services for residents. </p>\n<p>“One of the key things is that we didn’t want to instill a higher property tax on I.V.,” Schunk said. “We felt that that wouldn’t address the issue, so one of the key things that was proposed through the Special Legislative District was this idea of the users’ utility tax — that’s a scalable tax based on utility usage … What we were looking at there was also including a tax break for long-term residents.” </p>\n<p>According to Schunk, he and others involved in the I.V. self-governance movement plan to continue holding community forums to gauge public opinion regarding resident preferences toward government in order to base their action on decisions made by local residents and students. </p>\n<p>“What we will be doing is opening up community conversations,” Schunk said. “We will be running those for both the Spanish-speaking-only oriented style and then in an open-forum style … What we’ll be doing there is hoping to highlight common concerns that we see throughout the community and then bring those to the legislators so the conversation continues to happen.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he hopes to serve as a conduit from which I.V. residents can express their desires concerning self-governance.</p>\n<p>“Now let’s say the entire community comes together and says we don’t want self-government,” Schunk said. “Well, then we put the brakes on it. We let our elected officials know.”</p>\n<p>During discussion regarding the university trustee report’s proposed solutions for improving safety and security in I.V., Gross said forming relationships with multiple enforcement groups may help address crime.</p>\n<p>“We operate today 24 hours a day,” Gross said. “The aspects of public safety that we bring to the table, through our folks, is that there are partnerships with a number of good, collaborative efforts.”</p>\n<p>The forum also debated the effects of the increasing student population in I.V. in connection with an alleged increase in crime and disturbances. According to Gross, I.V.’s party culture has taken on a destructive nature due to students’ irresponsible behavior.</p>\n<p>“I.V. has taken a dramatic change over the years. Today the culture has changed,” Gross said. “It’s a collaborative effort between law enforcement and the UC, the County Fire Department and AMR, our medical ambulance provider, to deal with what happens as a result of the inappropriate behavior of kids that just don’t know better and haven’t learned life’s lessons yet.”</p>\n<p>Fleming said the university has policies in place that inform parents if students face an alcohol- or drug-related arrest or citation and a campus disciplinary process for violations regarding acts of violence or stalking. According to Fleming, although there is no campus disciplinary process for alcohol- or drug-related crimes, the parent notification system might help to discourage criminal activity. </p>\n<p>“We don’t currently have extension of our regulations that apply to students on campus for these kinds of things in Isla Vista,” Fleming said. “We do have extension of our jurisdiction for the more serious things like acts of violence, assault, sexual assault, hazing, stalking, domestic violence. Those kinds of more serious things we do hold our students accountable and take them through our conduct system.” </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58520\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/forum-discusses-recent-issues-plaguing-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58520\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/forum-discusses-recent-issues-plaguing-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/forum-discusses-recent-issues-plaguing-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/forum-discusses-recent-issues-plaguing-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/forum-discusses-recent-issues-plaguing-isla-vista/","id":4813,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4812,4811,4810],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Stays Safe This Halloween","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There were no major incidents in Isla Vista this past Halloween weekend and arrests and citations were down significantly compared to last year’s Halloween attendance, according to a statement from ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57825\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"850436030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57810\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57825\" data-attachment-id=\"57825\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-02/i-v-stays-safe-this-halloween/halloween-by-william-zhou_for-11-02-2014-1566/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg?fit=1600%2C913&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,913\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1414793567\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Halloween by William Zhou_for 11.02.2014-1566\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566.jpg?fit=888%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57825\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Halloween-by-William-Zhou_for-11.02.2014-1566-1024x584.jpg?resize=600%2C342\" alt=\"The rain may have kept out-of-towners away, but didn't dampen the spirits of I.V. residents.

Food Co-Op.</p>\n<p>I.V. is currently the largest unincorporated community under the direct governmental supervision of Santa Barbara County, and plans for its self-governance have been in the works throughout this past year, especially in light of past violent events such as Deltopia and the May 23 shootings. Among the different options on the table for potential forms of self-governance for I.V. — including the establishment of a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/self-governance-in-isla-vista-an-uncertain-future/\">Community Services District (CSD)</a>, the establishment of a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and cityhood — Abboud, Schunk and other self-governance advocates support establishing I.V. as a form of CSD.</p>\n<p>Initially presented to A.S. and county officials by recent graduate Josh Plotke, a CSD would absorb the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVPRD) — currently the only governing body within I.V. — as well as County Service Area No. 31 and provide a number of services funded through a utility users tax.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Coalition member and comparative literature graduate student Shari Sanders, many residents believe they do not have a voice in decisions made for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing people are saying is that they don’t have access to the decisions that are made in Isla Vista that are affecting them directly,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>According to Sanders, this disconnect stems from a lack of adequate representation for I.V. at the county level.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have our own kind of officials that are enfolded inside the county,” Sanders said. “We have an enormously difficult time holding anybody accountable for things that they say they will do for us.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine if we had the ability to install our own improved bluff fencing … The discussions about the fence could also occur in Isla Vista, instead of miles away at 9 a.m. on a Wednesday in a sterile county office building. — Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said April’s Deltopia riots exemplify the difficulties faced by I.V. when there is little student-to-county communication on how to deal with large, potentially dangerous events.</p>\n<p>“Students were tear gassed and civil unrest broke out on Deltopia because there was no cohesive plan with how to deal with the event,” Schunk said. “There was no cooperation from the county, largely.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, having an autonomous governmental entity in I.V. based off of a CSD will allow I.V. residents to leverage more power in the community via tax dollars spent on local projects.</p>\n<p>“We wouldn’t be waiting in line, or trying to entice the county to play favorites and spend money on us,” Schunk said. “We’d be able to spend the tax dollars on ourselves, on projects that were agreed upon at the local level.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58247\" style=\"width: 413px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"135838197\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58241\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58247\" data-attachment-id=\"58247\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/town-hall-meeting-st-marks-parish_kenneth-song_10-09-1024x680/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,680\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412710004\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024×680\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58247\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?resize=403%2C268\" alt=\"Community members presented options such as a Municipal Advisory Council, Community Services District and cityhood.

It’s like a one-size-fits-all,” Abboud said. “That size doesn’t fit Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>That being said, I.V. self-governance advocates such as Abboud and Schunk are pushing for a CSD “custom made” for I.V.</p>\n<p>“We want take some of the ideas of the CSD law and then write a new law that’s specially catered to Isla Vista’s needs,” Abboud said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re writing a skeleton version of the bill, and then we’re going to give that to them for the staff in the capitol to actually write it.  — Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk and Abboud said they have been working on drafting the “new law” with the intent of having it introduced into the California state legislature this December by Assemblyman Das Williams and State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.</p>\n<p>“We’ve met with them a lot about introducing the legislation and they’re both supportive,” Abboud said. “We’re writing a skeleton version of the bill, and then we’re going to give that to them for the staff in the capitol to actually write it.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said that if the would-be bill is enacted into state law, the next step will be to apply through the county to have a measure passed that calls for the establishment of a special district on the ballot in the next county-wide election.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58245\" style=\"width: 424px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"588370579\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58241\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58245\" data-attachment-id=\"58245\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/iv_photos_johnclow_11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=3000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1358266877\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IV_Photos_JohnClow_11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58245\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11-1024x682.jpg?resize=414%2C276\" alt=\"Schunk and Abboud hope to eventually see a measure passed that calls for the establishment of a special district on the ballot in the next county-wide election.

Part of the drafting process for this law will involve I.V. community input. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to him, part of the drafting process for the law involves holding public forums to receive public input on the intended form of government, with meetings to be held by Schunk and Abboud.</p>\n<p>“We hold public discussions to get more specific input so we can finish writing the bill,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>The Committee for a New Isla Vista (CNIV) is another entity working towards self-governance for Isla Vista. Chairman of CNIV Eric Hutchins said his group has been excluded from “these discussions.”</p>\n<p>“We have repeatedly suggested that we be invited to participate in panel discussions on ‘How to learn from past mistakes’ and ‘How to succeed in the present political and demographic environment of Isla Vista,’” Hutchins said.  “All to no avail.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The issues that I see with the Community Service District and the Municipal Advisory Council are that the Community Service District is not allowed to change the rules about how this area works. All these things require rule changes.  — Jay Freeman</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Hutchins, the CNIV proposes a local government that involves an “inclusive democracy,” governed by a body that would be called “Isla Vista New Community Alliance.” The governing representatives would be elected by residents and five major groups: property owners, business owners, special service districts, the County of Santa Barbara and UCSB and SBCC administrations, faculty and students. But according to Hutchins, his ideas for self-governance have been mostly ruled out by much of the I.V. population.</p>\n<p>“So far, it appears that [the CNIV] has been missed by student and community activists,” Hutchins said, “and our point-of-view dismissed without thoughtful engagement or consideration.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the disconnect between the CNIV and the rest of the community may stem from their preference for an advisory group to “provide perspective based on their efforts decades ago.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen CNIV move forward with ideas after receiving very little input from community members. They seek to dictate the terms of self-governance themselves,” Schunk said. “We need the involvement of every single group.”</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident, local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-07-23/i-v-community-discusses-self-governance/\">complete cityhood</a> for I.V. would be the best option for self-governance. According to Freeman, addressing issues such as renting, leasing and property owner accountability “can only be fixed if we have the ability to change the rules and change the laws that we operate under.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you were to go out there and ask people in Isla Vista about self-governance, two-thirds of them don’t know what that means. — Shari Sanders</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The issues that I see with the Community Service District and the Municipal Advisory Council are that the Community Service District is not allowed to change the rules about how this area works,” Freeman said. “All these things require rule changes.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman’s<a href=\"http://www.ivisacity.org/\"> webpage</a>, the services proposed under a CSD and its method of self-governance by levying taxes do not provide a completely sustainable model for the currently “unsustainable” I.V.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58244\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1396078632\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58241\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58244\" data-attachment-id=\"58244\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/iv_photos_johnclow_11-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.12.jpg?fit=3000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1390921278\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.12.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.12.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58244\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.12-1024x682.jpg?resize=396%2C264\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"396\" height=\"264\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58244\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abboud and Schunk hope to inform more I.V. residents about self-governance efforts through “community-driven discussion.” <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“At this point, the primary concerns people have about Isla Vista becoming a real city are only whether it can sustain its own budget,” Freeman stated. “However, its current situation (where it is essentially subsidized by the rest of the county) is simply unsustainable: Isla Vista needs to either figure out ways to decrease its cost or increase its revenue.”</p>\n<p>Self-governance preferences set aside, Sanders said that one of the largest challenges the movement toward self-governance faces is that a majority of the I.V. community is unaware of the implications of self-governance or the existence of self-governance efforts.</p>\n<p>“If you were to go out there and ask people in Isla Vista about self-governance, two-thirds of them don’t know what that means,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, these issues are something that future conversations will hopefully resolve.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple primary things that I think we have to keep in mind as we work to include the folks in the conversation who are traditionally not present,” Schunk said. “The biweekly community conversations Jonathan [Abboud] and I are hosting provide an opportunity for community-driven discussion.”</p>\n<p>[<strong>Correction: </strong>A previous version of this article stated the event “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1486131641663918/?ref=51&amp;source=1\">Isla Vista Special District – A Conversation on How to Run IV’s Future Government</a>” was at 4 p.m. when in fact it is at 4:30 p.m. The <em>Daily Nexus</em> regrets this error.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
