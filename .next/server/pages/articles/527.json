Last season at Mt. San Jacinto, Smith led his team to the quarterfinals of the California Community College State Tournament while averaging 14 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“My staff had watched him play and we just decided that we wanted to add a little bit more depth at the guard position,” Coach Williams said. “I’m very excited to add more physical, quick, aggressive, pressure type defenders to a team that I do believe is going to have the ability to be very good defensively.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the team’s depth at guard is 6’2” combo guard Gabe Vincent out of Stockton, CA. Vincent attended St. Mary’s High School and played at the highest level of AAU basketball in the state for the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very well-rounded complete guard that doesn’t really have a weakness, particularly out of high school,” Coach Williams said. “He does everything well. He’s a very good defender, very good rebounder, very good shooter and passer. He really has an extremely well balanced game.”</p>\n<p>Vincent is expected to contribute right away as a shooting guard, but has the skill set to play both the point guard and shooting guard positions.</p>\n<p>“Vincent and Smith will play right away. They’re both very ready physically to contribute. They’re strong, they’re tough, they defend,” Coach Williams said. “They’re not going to be intimidated, neither one of them, and they’re both going to be really good additions.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class is Justin Burks, a 6’6” forward out of Nevada. Burks attended Las Vegas’ Arbor View High School and also played at the highest level of AAU basketball for the Las Vegas Prospects.</p>\n<p>“He adds to the John Green-Michael Bryson type category. He’s versatile, longer, taller,” Coach Williams said. “He’s going to have to get a lot more physical and stronger but his upside is very good.”</p>\n<p>While Burks figures to need more time to adjust to the college game in comparison to Vincent and Smith, he adds versatility and the ability to play and defend the two, three and four positions on the floor.</p>\n<p>“He has a really good mid-range game, and he’s really good off the dribble getting into the paint,” Coach Williams said. “He’s pretty active chasing rebounds. Those things add a lot to us.”</p>\n<p>The three newcomers join a talented and veteran group of players headlined by Williams. Big Al led the Big West in points and rebounds per game, while ranking 12th in the nation in scoring and second nationally in rebounding.</p>\n<p>“Most everybody that’s coming here is excited playing with a guy of Al’s caliber,” Coach Williams said. We think it’s a great thing that we’re adding the pieces to play around a great player.”</p>\n<p>Rising junior guard Michael Bryson played second fiddle to Big Al last season, finishing second on the team in scoring while garnering Big West Honorable Mention. Bryson figures to start at either the shooting guard or small forward position next season.</p>\n<p>Point guard play looks to be a source of strength for the Gauchos next season, thanks in large part to rising senior Zalmico Harmon. Harmon finished last season with the second best assist-to-turnover ratio in the entire nation and finished the year with Big West Honorable Mention accolades.</p>\n<p>“We’re hopeful that Z makes as big as a jump between his junior and senior year as he did during his junior year,” Coach Williams said. “We thought he got way better as the year went on. We feel like he has a whole other level he can go to as his comfort zone in the program rises.”</p>\n<p>Also playing point will be sophomore Eric Childress and junior T.J. Taylor. Childress finished his freshman year with spectacular consistency towards the end of the season, while Taylor is a two-year starter who missed last season with a hip injury.</p>\n<p>Smith will certainly compete for point guard playing time with the trio and Vincent could even work his way into the conversation by the end of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that [Smith] would play that position over them, he’d play with them, which allows you to have two point guards on the floor like I did with Eric and Z,” Coach Williams said. “Now we’ll have five guys in the program that are very good with the ball and very good off the bounce.”</p>\n<p>The rest of UCSB’s rotation will consist of rising junior forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler, redshirt freshman forward Alex Hart and junior guard John Green. Brewe started much of the year at power forward for the Gauchos last season while Beeler provided solid backup minutes at both the four and five spots.</p>\n<p>Hart redshirted last season but brings a versatile ability to shoot the ball from outside in addition to his 6’10” frame. Green has lost most of his career to injury but has the potential to add another deadly scorer and physical presence to UCSB if he can stay healthy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 20, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55443\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55443\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/","id":527,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[526,525,524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Heat Superstar-Trio Still Has Lots to Prove","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Mark Salay discusses why the Heat don't measure up with the NBA's greatest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Eight wins.

With three titles, that puts them in the same playing field as Kobe and Shaq’s Lakers, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker’s Spurs and Larry Bird’s great Celtics teams. Those teams won three titles each.</p>\n<p>However, for the Heat to enter the upper echelon of dynasties would mean equating them with teams that revolutionized the game. Bill Russell’s Celtics, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Lakers and Michael Jordan’s Bulls all fall under this elite category. The Minneapolis Lakers of the early 1950s led by George Mikan also deserves a spot in this class.</p>\n<p>Consider that these teams all won at least four titles, played against formidable competition and dominated the game.</p>\n<p>Jordan three-peated twice and if he hadn’t decided to take a two-year break from the game, the Bulls would most likely have won eight straight titles.</p>\n<p>Not only did Chicago win each time they reached the Finals, none of the series were pushed to a game seven. LeBron and Co. lost in their first appearance and if it wasn’t for an incredibly clutch three-point shot from</p>\n<p>Ray Allen, last year’s Finals wouldn’t even have gone to a deciding game seven.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the topic of who Miami has faced in the championship round. In 2012, the Heat played against a young and inexperienced Oklahoma City squad that was not ready to take the crown just yet.</p>\n<p>Last year, a game seven proved to be too much for an aging Spurs team. Going against Kevin Durant before this year or Duncan past his prime does not cut it when talking about all-time great dynasties.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Showtime Lakers had to go through the legendary Celtics teams led by Bird. Those games pitted two opponents who had the same caliber of talent and saved the NBA from going extinct. The</p>\n<p>Johnson-Bird rivalry increased interest of the NBA and brought a new generation of fans to the game.</p>\n<p>Russell had his own rival in Wilt Chamberlain and Jordan went toe-to-toe with the two-headed monster of Karl Malone and John Stockton twice. James is the best player in the league, but there is no equivalent for him to prove his mettle.</p>\n<p>The Heat are also not on par with the dominance achieved with teams that came before. Minneapolis, the league’s first dynasty, won five championships in six years. Boston failed to win a title just once during the 1960s. That ladies and gentlemen, is dominance. The Heat are good, but not that good.</p>\n<p>And if you had to pick one coach to draw up the last play with the game on the line, would you have Erik Spoelstra design the play, or hand things over to Red Auerbach or Phil Jackson? The championship rings on those coach’s fingers can answer that question. Auerbach won nine times and Jackson ran out of fingers to show off his rings.</p>\n<p>If the Heat win it this year they deserve to be ranked higher than other mini-dynasties such as the Houston Rockets of the mid 1990s or the Detroit Pistons of the Bad Boy era. Their name probably is on the same plateau as Bird’s Celtics and Kobe and Shaq’s L.A. teams. However, to enter legendary status and be considered the greatest, Miami will have to win, “not three, not four, not six, not seven.” Only time will tell if that happens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A

season this past weekend at the hands of No. 4 USC on the road and No. 6 Long Beach State at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got blown out by the Trojans 14-5 on Saturday afternoon in a game where UCSB couldn’t amass much offense against a stubborn USC team. The Gauchos started the game with a goal from senior utility Chase Racich early in the first quarter, but USC then took control and never let go, with three goals in the first quarter followed by six in the second to give the Trojans a 9-2 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was a close battle as the Gauchos held the Trojans to only two goals while scoring two of their own from junior attacker Bryan Snyder and junior attacker Kevin Cappon, his second of the game. The game ended 14-5 after a goal from freshman attacker Josh Jordan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos weren’t able to make up for their loss the prior day as UCSB fell to Long Beach St. 14-12 in another close game between the two evenly matched teams. Their previous encounter saw the Gauchos win in sudden death overtime 14-13, but they weren’t able to pull through yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“For me I think we lost the game in the first half,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We gave up two or three really easy goals to them. One was a rebound goal that we should have boxed out and got the rebound, and then another one we were trying to get out of the half and we committed an offensive foul to give them a big opportunity.”</p>\n<p>After Long Beach went up 1-0, the Gauchos countered with a goal from Cappon before the 49ers ended the first quarter up 4-2. Both teams scored five goals apiece in the second quarter as the Gauchos benefited from goals by junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, junior attacker Ryan Baliani, junior two-meter Liam Gaughan and two from Snyder.</p>\n<p>Going into the second half both teams looked to continue playing physically in the close contest. It ended up being a half of missed opportunities for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The first big play of the second half was a penalty shot opportunity for the Gauchos. Snyder stepped up in the one-on-one opportunity against Long Beach St.’s junior goalie Pavo Ljepopio, and ripped a shot that hit the post.</p>\n<p>Later in the quarter the Gauchos wasted a six-on-three opportunity with a shot over the goal and continued to miss chances to put more points on the board. UCSB hit the post back-to-back in one possession, and freshman attacker Shane Hauschild was stopped on a breakaway opportunity before he was able to take a shot.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we did miss two penalties and didn’t capitalize on a six-on-three opportunity,” Wigo said. “Those were critical moments.”</p>\n<p>Entering the fourth quarter, the game was still a close contest with Long Beach St. leading 12-9. After the 49ers got an early goal in the quarter, the Gauchos pulled a goal back as Hauschild converted a penalty shot opportunity. Long Beach St. then countered with a goal of its own before Hauschild had another penalty shot. This time Ljepopio made the save, conserving his team’s four-goal lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos pushed back as they scored two goals from Cappon and senior utility Brendan McElroy to cut the deficit to two with 1:23 to go. After a couple of missed shots, the game came to a close with the score 14-12.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look towards this weekend when they face top competition at the So Cal Tournament at UCLA.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56459\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56459\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/","id":525,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[524,523,522],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miami Trails Elite Dynasties of the NBA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nexus sports editor Kristen Henneman discusses the Heat's place in NBA history.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the sports world today, the worth of any player or team is based upon how many championships they own.</p>\n<p>Personal accolades and regular season awards are great, but if you can’t win rings, you can forget being considered in the conversation for the best of all time.</p>\n<p>Currently fighting to stand on the list for best franchises of all time is the Miami Heat.

More recently, Los Angeles won three-straight titles in 2000-02 behind one of the best duos in NBA history in Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Bulls have also known the glory of the three-peat twice, accomplishing it in 1991-93 and 1996-98. Chicago, of course, was led by arguably the best player to ever play the game of basketball, Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>The team standing above all however, is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics utterly dominated the basketball world in the sixties, winning eight championships in a row and 11 in 13 years from 1957-69. The master behind the success? A 6’10’’ center by the name of Bill Russell.</p>\n<p>Russell, who is underrated when it comes to listing the best players of all time, holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls, the Heat features one of the best players to ever grace a basketball court and certainly the best player currently playing the game right now: LeBron James. Miami also features the “Big Three” in James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, which has captivated audiences all over the world.</p>\n<p>The Heat’s fast-paced, flashy play and incredible talent make them one of the most entertaining teams of all time if nothing else. They also play at a time where the level of competition around the league is much higher (excluding the Eastern Conference this season).</p>\n<p>Every year now, there are a handful of teams fighting for the NBA Championship rather than just a couple teams that were powerhouses decades ago. It does make the idea of a three-peat seem even more remarkable.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when it all comes down to it, it’s all about the rings. Boston leads the NBA in championships with an incredible 17 titles. The Lakers don’t rank far behind with 16.</p>\n<p>Considering that a sports dynasty is defined as “a team that dominates its sport or league for an extraordinary length of time,” these are the two teams that should be considered dynasties.</p>\n<p>They’re always in the hunt and rarely have off years. They’re the teams everyone wants to be a part of because there’s always a good chance to make history.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Lakers and Celtics are the best teams in NBA history. Period.</p>\n<p>With that said, Chicago would have to come next on the list for ranking of the best team with six crowns, all coming in the electrifying era that was Jordan.</p>\n<p>The Jordan Era made Chicago a destination for great players and a city that desired greatness in the basketball world. Nevertheless, the Bulls are still looking for that next group to bring home more rings and give the Bulls multiple eras of greatness.</p>\n<p>As for Miami, which currently owns three championships, another title would bring the Heat’s total to four, tying it for fourth-most crowns in NBA history with San Antonio.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Miami will go down as one of the most elite franchises in the NBA if it can three-peat in June, but four franchise championships is a long way off from 17, 16 or even six crowns.<br>\nAnd considering that the number of championships determines your worth, the Heat still have a long way to go if it wants to move up in the ranking for best team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/","id":526,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[525,524,523],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
