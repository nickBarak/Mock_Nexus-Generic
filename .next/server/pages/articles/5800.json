Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements. Apartment building hallways are cramped with the homeless and sick. Flying, heavily armed cars race across the sky as oppressive, electronic tones courtesy of Hans Zimmer blast in your ears. It tells you immediately that the world you see in front of you is oppressive, unpleasant.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this neo-noir destitution, artificially created humans called “replicants” continue to be produced for slave labor. Specialized LAPD detectives called “blade runners” hunt down the older models, many of whom just want to be left alone.</p>\n<p>Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is one such “blade runner.” It quickly becomes clear that K is not a particularly remarkable person; he’s very robotic, stone-faced and unemotional. Although he occasionally questions the ethics of his job, he still carries it out, believing he has no choice in the matter. Even if the film doesn’t dig too deep into initial motivations, K still serves as the catalyst by which the film asks questions regarding the nature of the human and the artificial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For instance, take K’s holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas). Although copied and pasted from a mass-produced template and encoded onto a thumb drive for the sake of portability, Joi manages to demonstrate a degree of self-awareness. In a stroke of brevity and intelligence, the film never quite makes it clear if her growing independence evolved by itself or was programmed into her. Even though she has at least a small degree of freedom of movement, Joi yearns to overcome her existence as a mere product, seeking emotional fulfillment. I’m not familiar with Ana de Armas or her work, but I think she certainly has the chops to tackle more dramatic roles in the future if she so wishes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79204\" style=\"width: 1915px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1547592895\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79203\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79204\" data-attachment-id=\"79204\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/unnamed-46/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=1905%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1905,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=888%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79204\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=888%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1905&amp;ssl=1 1905w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of the Movie Database</p></div>\n<p>This desire to be human, or to transcend it, is the thread holding the entire post-Ridley Scott tapestry together. What looks like a very bland story on paper — a cop uncovers a conspiracy with huge ramifications for society — delves into K’s past and forces him to ask himself questions about himself and what it all means for him and for the replicants. The movie continues the story from the original “Blade Runner” in a fascinating way that subversively pulls on tried-and-true sci-fi tropes.</p>\n<p>In the process of K’s investigation, we are introduced to Jared Leto in a role that allows him to spout the most forgettable philosophy babble I’ve heard since “Transcendence.” He’s the face behind the faceless entity that is corporate greed, and as antagonists go, he’s not up to snuff. He emotes very little and there is hardly any backstory present to flesh him out. His henchwoman Luv comes across as more complex, if perhaps a little contradictory. Perhaps, if you listen closely as Leto goes on about the nature of replicants in his silky tones, you might find yourself being lulled into a nap.</p>\n<p>On the flip side of Mr. ASMR, “2049” brings back original “Blade Runner” protagonist Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). While Deckard doesn’t show up until toward the end of the second act, he ties into K’s story in a fascinating, even subversive way that pulls from the events and consequences of the original film. Anyone looking to catch a bone regarding the long-persisting theory regarding whether or not Deckard’s a replicant isn’t going to find anything to gnaw on. It’s no longer his story to question the nature of humanity but instead the implications of it being able to evolve.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, the movie is not just a philosophical slog, I promise. You’re still going to get some shootouts and good ol’ robot fisticuff brawling. There’s entertainment to be had, but this isn’t joining the likes of “Fury Road” and “The Force Awakens” among the pantheon of 30-years-later blockbuster action sequels. “Blade Runner 2049” takes its time to get to its payoff — perhaps a little too much time. There’s so much excess that an entire subplot alluding to a replicant revolution goes absolutely nowhere. Sequel bait, perhaps? “Blade Runner 2079”?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/","id":5800,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5799,5798,5797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Open Letter on Gun Control","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Marc Reisman explores the issue of gun control.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This is an open letter to the UCSB, to the entire UC system and to students everywhere about what I believe.</p>\n<p>In the 1960’s, students changed the war culture of the United States.

I believe that if the people on the streets of Isla Vista had been armed, many more bystanders would have been injured or killed.</p>\n<p>I believe that guns are not necessarily the problem, but the culture of people who believe that carrying guns during everyday life creates a belief system that perpetuates the great potential for societal harm.</p>\n<p>I believe that weapons derived from war, such as those with large capacity magazines, automatic rifles such as the AK- models, have no place in society. They are weapons of war.</p>\n<p>Finally, I believe that the community of the UC system has the power to make changes. There are 235,000 students enrolled, from all over the country and the world. In addition, the larger community of students from college and university systems around the country numbers in the millions. Use social media, contacts at other universities around the country, and ACT.</p>\n<p>Demand that your congressmen and women enact sane gun control laws.</p>\n<p>Use the power of your votes immediately in the upcoming election to oust any of the elected officials who ignore the will of the people.</p>\n<p>People have the right to own guns, but we all have the right to expect safety on the streets as well as in the businesses and other public spots we attend.</p>\n<p>Having guns carried in bars where people imbibe in substances which impair judgment is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Carrying guns in churches, synagogues and mosques is antithetical to the teachings of any religion.</p>\n<p>Automatic weapons belong in the military, not among civilians.<br>\nLike the activists of the sixties, use the power of your numbers and political strength to change the gun culture.</p>\n<p>Join and support groups such as the Brady Campaign currently engaged in sane gun law changes.

My heart aches for all who have been affected by this recent tragedy, in a college town I called my own home for four years. But, my heart breaks over and over again for Elliot’s family, too.</p>\n<p>This family clearly tried to get the attention of authorities in attempt to get their son help. They got in their car and tried to drive up to Santa Barbara after reading his disturbing manifesto, but they were too late. They were too late because the mental healthcare system is broken.</p>\n<p>In case my comments have vexed any of you, let me explain: I unfortunately can speak from personal experience, because my brother currently suffers from schizoaffective disorder. He battles the demons inside his head every day; he is delusional and lost. He has been discharged from psychiatric facilities numerous times by judges that deem him not to be a danger to himself and others, nor gravely disabled, after the required 72-hour or 5150 hold. Before he can successfully start to adjust to any medication, he is released without any support system in place. Why? Because no system exists<strong>. </strong>My brother, like so many others, simply goes through a revolving door. In and out of an acute psychiatric facility with a meager 12-15 beds in the locked unit. And that’s if an open bed even exists. My brother also knows how to appear in front of authority figures, and as a result he slips through the cracks. There are cracks because the mental health system in our country has major flaws — flaws that I hope have become so blaringly apparent that we can no longer ignore them. These flaws led to seven deaths in Isla Vista with many more injured — both physically and emotionally.</p>\n<p>This is not simply a discussion of “better gun control” or “nice guy mentality gone wrong;” this is much bigger than that. While those discussions are important, they only scratch the surface of what really needs to be examined right here, right now.</p>\n<p>I have lost track of the number of shootings in recent years with weapons brandished by delusional males in their twenties, who have escaped any sort of mental health treatment. The pattern is sickeningly clear: no proper preventative channels exist in today’s mental healthcare system. This must end now. Too many lives, young and old, have been prematurely taken. Too many families have suffered. To reference the words of Chris Martinez’s father: not one more.</p>\n<p>I speak out now on behalf of my family, and all other families who currently deal with the burden of loved ones who are mentally ill. I also speak out for my Gauchos, who I hope can continue to band together in this time of sorrow and pain. I stand with you; I stand with all of you.</p>\n<p><em>Sarah is a UCSB alumna.</em></p>\n<h6>This is a  <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus </em>or UCSB.

My skin prickles. This week, news vans took up residence on Pardall, Isla Vista’s main street, ready to capture a community that seems permanently caught between utopia and chaos. We seem to be the perfect paradox: a coastal paradise plucked straight from a movie set, yet marred with the crime rates of an inner-city ghetto. As UCSB students, we have slowly become desensitized to the ritual weekend emails that populate our inbox in the early hours. We reach for our phones and glaze over yet another police report; “Attempted robbery” blurs with “assault” and “suspected weapon”. To the outside world, we are a town of riots, tear gas, beached bodies and binge drinking.</p>\n<p>I understand that; it’s what makes the news. But this half-painted picture cannot be the only one we offer. When I arrived in California from London at age 19, the kindness of this community astounded me. It took me from a scared, lonely freshman thousands of miles away from home to a passionate advocate for our little town and all its beauty. Isla Vista has mystified me, taught me and inspired me beyond my wildest imagination.<br>\nMy mind leaves the stadium and wanders to the swaying eucalyptus groves that line the bluffs, their trailing leaves rustled by the warm afternoon wind.  They carry an unmistakable scent that any Isla Vistan will recognize: the earthy fragrance of bark mixed with ocean breeze and just a hint of oil. For many of us, it smells like home. \t</p>\n<p>A sea of students bob like seals in the glassy ocean, a movie scene that is nothing but another Tuesday afternoon in Isla Vista. There is beauty in this place and its people that can never be captured on cameras. They will never see us enter as wide-eyed freshmen, smitten with partying on Del Playa, but leave as activists, teachers, artists and entrepreneurs. They weren’t there as we swept broken glass from our streets after the riots, when we cleaned our beaches or raised $200,000 to save our local food co-op. We are so much more than the collective sum of our headlines.  We are nearly two square miles of passion, learning and growth. Our town is so compact that it sometimes seems we feel a collective heartbeat. Emotions spread through our neighborhood like an incoming tide; we laugh together, play together and mourn together. Now, more than ever, we must heal together. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The sinking sun turns the ocean to liquid gold as hundreds of boards glide through the water, headed for the growing circle gathered for Wednesday’s Memorial Paddle-Out. I look around to see hundreds of my classmates bobbing beside me, hands interlinked in solidarity. We splash the water and chants echo to the open sky as we remember those we have lost. A feeling of unity flows through the vast circle like electricity. Saltwater mingles with tears and flowers arc the air, making rainbows on the ocean surface. Looking into the glowing faces of those around me, I have never felt so deeply connected to my fellow Gauchos.<br>\n“Now, turn to the person next to you and greet them,” the loudspeaker says. “Touch them, rub their hair, hug them.” I look around to see the ocean shift in a thousand embraces, and realize in this instant that our community is more powerful than I had ever imagined. I have never seen smiles more genuine, or felt hugs more sincere than in those moments, as the sun sets over the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>Right now, we may feel small and fragile after the actions of a few, of those who see our community only as something to be torn down. This week has taught me that the only power we have against these unstoppable forces is our kindness to one another, those actions that cost us nothing — the time we take to smile at strangers, listen with sincerity, show empathy and kindness to everyone who crosses our path. Days after the event that shook our town, a sense of fragility still fills the air, but it is tinged with something else, too. Now, words seem gentler, the smiles longer, the embraces tighter. </p>\n<p>On my way home from class, I gaze at the bullet holes peppering the glass of I.V. Deli, the site of Christopher’s shooting. Flower petals spread over and around these wounds, almost eclipsing the original scars in the window, and spill in the hundreds onto the sidewalk below. As we begin to recover, I can only hope that we don’t forget what this week has taught us. </p>\n<p>In the words of a banner tied to a house on Sabado Tarde, “What we do now is up to us.” Let us tread lightly on this beautiful patch of land we call home for four years. Let us show respect and kindness as if it were our only means of survival, because that might just be the case. Let us realize that our love for one another is our only defense, but that together, we are strong. </p>\n<p>Hanna Mendoza is a fourth-year global studies and technology management double major.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, June 5, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus </em>or UCSB.
