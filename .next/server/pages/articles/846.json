\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite the team’s sub-par record at this point, the Gauchos are looking for progress and another come-from-behind conference season. Four games in, it looks like Santa Barbara is on the right track.</p>\n<p>Heading into conference play last season featured Santa Barbara sitting at 5-8; however, the Gauchos came alive in Big West play, going 9-7 and improving to 16-16 overall to close out the season at .500.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to compete against Long Beach State in the Big West Championship, falling just short of the 49ers.</p>\n<p>While there have certainly been rough patches through Santa Barbara’s 2017-2018 campaign thus far, the Gauchos have demonstrated continual improvement. Improvement that, if continued, will perhaps carry Santa Barbara to another successful run in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m process-oriented, I’m not result oriented. If you focus on just a result, you’re not going to address the process element of the result. So for us, continuing to grow stretches where we play well and execute and we have the effort and the energy and the attention to detail it takes to be successful,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>“Then shrink the stretches of the opposite of that where we’ve not been disciplined, we’ve not been dialed in and not brought energy.”</p>\n<p>While turnovers remain a frustrating stat for UCSB, the Gauchos are finding ways to win. In their victory over New Mexico State, the Gauchos turned the ball over 22 times in spite of winning by 30 points. In the close win against rival Cal Poly, UCSB committed 33 turnovers. Santa Barbara’s averaging 17.8 turnovers per game this season, but 19.3 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite turnover woes, the Gauchos have been finding their rhythm offensively as they work the ball inside to redshirt senior Drew Edelman more effectively.</p>\n<p>Edelman is having an even better year than last season and that’s with her early battles with various injuries.</p>\n<p>The 6’4 forward is posting a statline of 14.3 points per game, which is almost four more points than she averaged last season, to go along with 9.4 boards.</p>\n<p>When simply looking at Santa Barbara’s results this season, it may be easy to dismiss the Gauchos in favor of Big West teams with better records.</p>\n<p>But, it is the constant adjustment as well as overall improvement that carries a team through a season, which Henrickson understands.</p>\n<p>“Good players and good teams find success and get better because they eliminate the things that don’t work and bad teams stay bad because they continue to do the things that don’t work,” said Henrickson. “[The Big West] is really good, young, fun and talented and exciting.”</p>\n<p>With momentum and anticipation of Big West competition, the Gauchos will certainly be put to the test as they seek to improve the process rather than simply the result.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Andrew Hernandez<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-2018 season has not been kind to the 49ers of the Long Beach State women’s basketball team so far. The team’s overall record of 2-16 is a far cry from the 9-6 record the team had at the end of its non-conference schedule last season.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have had difficulty establishing a winning rhythm, and are winless at 0-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The team had eight players, including four seniors, leave from last year’s squad but were able to fill the spots by bringing seven freshmen to the team. Among those freshmen were Ma’Qhi Berry, Shanaijah Davison and Emma Merriweather, who have done their best to make their impact on the team felt. Each player has scored 100+ points so far this season, but the team has still found themselves coming up short.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ last win came on Dec. 7 in an exciting game that came down to the final minutes when senior Cecily Wilson put LBSU ahead by six with a layup. The 49ers were able to hold off GCU until time expired.</p>\n<p>Wilson is the only senior present within the team’s top four scorers and currently leads the 49ers in rebounds, averaging 6.6 a game. The veteran presence on the team has certainly taken a dive due to last year’s departures, but Wilson has shown that the team has the potential to do well given their significant amount of youth and guidance from the more experienced members of the team.</p>\n<p>“In order for us to be successful in conference play, we have to be more consistent on both ends off the floor. We have to stay disciplined and maintain our effort for 40 min,” Head Coach Jeff Cammon said. “To be specific, limit second chance opportunities by boxing out/rebounding on defensive end. Lastly, we have to take care of the ball and value possessions on [the] offensive end. This conference is tough, and we have to have a competitive mentality every night.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host UCSB Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Following last season’s below average 7-9 record in Big West conference play, the Cal Poly women’s basketball team entered this year with something to prove.</p>\n<p>Now 8-7 overall, the Mustangs will try to find areas in which they can improve their game.</p>\n<p>They currently hold a conference record of 2-1 as the Big West competition unfurls.</p>\n<p>After ending third to last in the previous Big West regular season, Cal Poly’s Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh will want to return to major tournament play during her 21st season in the manager role and after four appearances in either the NCAA Tournament or WNIT since 2011.</p>\n<p>To help achieve this she’ll look to her most veteran players for help on reaching this team goal.</p>\n<p>Trying to improve upon last season’s seeding of No. 7 overall, Cal Poly has already started off on the right foot with their 2-1 record that places them in a tie for third overall in the Big West conference standings.</p>\n<p>Three Cal Poly players to keep an eye on as the regular season rolls on would be junior center Devin Stanback, senior forward Emily Anderson and senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who are all statistical leaders in their own individual Big West categories.</p>\n<p>After coming off their most recent 84-71 win at home against the CSUN women’s basketball program, hopes are high for what this Cal Poly women’s basketball squad can truly accomplish.</p>\n<p>Made up of mostly returning upperclasswomen, spearheaded by Mimnaugh’s stellar coaching talents and a familiar game scheme aimed at success; this side expects at the very least a deep playoff run as it continues to progress into the 2017-18 campaign.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will host UC Davis this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Sean White<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Fullerton’s 1-15 conference record last season was the third time in program history that it finished with just one win in conference play.</p>\n<p>CSUF’s 16-16 record in 2006-07 was its last time ending a season with an overall record of .500 or above, and its 8-7 conference finish was its last conference winning record.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, such results led to the hiring of Head Coach Jeff Harada. In his first year, he has already helped the Titans eclipse their conference win total of last season.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 7-10, 2-2 in the Big West, the Titans are tied for fourth place in the conference. With no Big West Tournament appearances in the last two years, the Titans’ time to rise may be near.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest thing I’ve learned this year has been patience. As a coach we are all very competitive by nature and want to win every game we play right away,” Harada said. “Understanding the history and state of our program, my goal is obviously to change that, but I have to remind myself that it’s not going to happen overnight. It truly is a process. Turning those small victories into bigger ones will hopefully take us where we want to be in the future.”</p>\n<p>Key factors within this process are junior guards Hannah Thompson and Jade Vega, who both rank in the top 10 of the Big West in scoring with averages of 12 PPG.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell if Fullerton can manage to put together a run that will secure a spot within the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Until then, we wait for March.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Brandon Victor<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Despite losing its first five games of the season, the Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team looks like it could possibly contend for the Big West title.</p>\n<p>CSUN (8-9, 1-2) recovered from its tough start by ripping off four straight wins, however, things have slightly declined considering the Matadors’ current two-game losing streak after defeating Cal State Fullerton in their first conference game of the season, 70-68.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s recent slump, the presence of junior center Channon Fluker could possibly catapult the Matadors up the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Fluker, who was named the Big West Player of the Year last season, became the second player in Big West history to lead the conference in scoring, rebounding and blocks.</p>\n<p>In 17 games played this season, she has recorded eight double-doubles while averaging a conference leading 20.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Fluker even recorded a triple-double during the team’s Dec. 30 game against Seattle, scoring 28 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, all while setting a conference record with 13 blocks en route to a 67-62 victory.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest strengths this season are our post play, depth and rebounding,” Head Coach Jason Flower said.</p>\n<p>The team will need to improve its late-game execution if it hopes to compete for the conference title this season. Other than a 48-point drubbing by Oregon to start the season, all of CSUN’s losses have been by single digits this season.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s next match is against Cal State Fullerton at  7p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18 at the Matadome.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Andrew Bishop<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Second-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue and her players entered the 2017-18 season with one goal in mind: to leave their 2016-17 season behind. Last year, the Anteaters went a paltry 5-26, with only three wins against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>“Last year I took over a team that was mainly senior-based,” Inoue said. “They did a good job, we just couldn’t finish games.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems Inoue faced going into this season was rebuilding a team that had recently lost a number of key seniors. “I had to replace a lot just because I was losing a lot,” she said. “A lot of the players from last year aren’t here this season, so it’s been a fresh start.”</p>\n<p>Irvine’s younger players have shared the bulk of the scoring throughout the majority of the season, with the help of sophomore guards Lauren Saiki (8.7 points per game) and Yazzy Sa’Dullah (7.7 points per game), and freshman forward Jordan Sanders (8.1 points per game).</p>\n<p>Irvine has also been supported in recent games by redshirt junior transfer guard Morgan Green, who made her Anteater debut on Jan. 4 against UC Davis. Green was sidelined throughout Irvine’s 2016-17 season, and the non-conference portion of its 2017-18 season due to NCAA transfer regulations.</p>\n<p>Despite suffering a loss to current conf. leader UC Davis in her first game as an Anteater, Green has lit up the scoreboard in her three appearances, averaging 22.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off of a 77-74 win against UCSB which puts them at 2-1 in conference play. They will hope to add to their win total and continue their comeback season as they face Cal Poly this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Jorge Mercado<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017-18 season has been an odd one for the Hawaii women’s basketball team. After going 7-6 in non-conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were poised to make some noise come Big West play. Unfortunately for them, that has yet to be the case.</p>\n<p>Hawaii began conference play with three straight losses, with two on the road, but rebounded in their most recent effort in a home win against last place Long Beach State to have a 1-3 mark at this point in the conference season. They are currently in eighth place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Offensively, Hawaii has some good talent. They currently possess the second-best shooting percentage in the conference at 40.8 and average 64.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Their leading scorer has been senior guard Sarah Toeaina, who was named to the Preseason All-Conference team by both the media and the coaches. She currently averages 14.1 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the team averaging double figures is sophomore guard Julissa Tago, who is scoring 10.8 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The preseason poll had both coaches and the media expecting the Rainbow Wahine to finish in fourth place; however, with the struggles the team has going for them so far, there is no doubt there needs to be some work done before that prediction could become a reality.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing Hawaii has going for them, it is that they are currently 6-4 at home; however, now that Big West play is in full swing, they will need to shore up that defense on the road as well if they want to have some success.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s next match is against UCR on Thursday, Jan. 18, at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Spencer Ault<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team entered the Big West Tournament with high hopes last season. UCSB brought those hopes crashing to the ground in the semifinals, defeating the Aggies 73-59 before falling to Long Beach State 56-55 in the finals.</p>\n<p>Disappointed as it was, UC Davis managed to bounce back in the WNIT. The Aggies advanced to the Sweet 16 after beating Utah and Colorado State, before falling to Washington State.</p>\n<p>Building off that postseason success, the Aggies are 13-3, and kicked off their season with ten straight wins.</p>\n<p>One of those wins came over Washington State in an impressive 91-76 victory that displayed how the Aggies have in fact improved from last year’s strong season. UCD’s success has continued in Big West play as well, as the team has gone 3-0 with victories over Irvine, Riverside and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch has borne the bulk of the scoring load for UCD with 19.8 points per game. Bertsch was named to the first-team All-Big West last season, and is on pace to earn a repeat of the honor on this go around.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Pele Gianotti joined Bertsch on that team last season. Gianotti has been effective this season as well with around ten points per game and a team-high 5.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Rachel Nagel is next in line for scoring with 11.6 points per game, and has knocked down 42.6 percent of her three point attempts. That’s not the highest mark on the team, an honor that goes to senior guard Dani Nafekh, but it’s still a marksman-like percentage.</p>\n<p>UCD will have its first chance to redeem its semifinal upset loss when it takes on the Gauchos on Thursday, Jan. 18 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Kendra Jackson<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Riverside Highlanders are 5-13 overall and are currently 2-2 in Big West conference play. With a 3-4 record at home, the team has only managed to reign victorious away from the confines of the UCR Student Recreation Center once this season.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, when considering the team’s progress last season, the Highlanders ended as the fourth seed in the Big West tournament. With a 16-15 record overall and 9-7 in conference play, the initial first round matchup for UCR turned out to be the eighth seeded UC Irvine Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In terms of moving forward, UCR can still set its sights on a legitimate playoff run if it focuses on improving its record in conference play and dedicating itself to winning games not just at home, but also while on the road.</p>\n<p>With a playmaker like senior guard Michelle Curry running the show and redshirt sophomore forward Skyler Lewis collecting the boards, UCR definitely has the talent to right the ship.</p>\n<p>Curry averages 15.5 points per game, fourth best mark in the conference while Lewis averages 7.6 rebounds per game, also the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, the Highlanders are the sixth seed, but conference play has just begun and there is plenty of time to improve, especially since UCR is not too far behind Cal State Fullerton in the standings. If their conference play begins to excel, they can make a splash in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Coming off its most recent win against the CSUF at home in which senior guard Lauren Holt dropped 22 points, UCR is set to ride that momentum when it takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 18</em><em>, 2018</em><em>, edition of

story: The “Wild West” boasts a large number of 50-win teams, while the East has about one or two teams that have just a slim chance of challenging whatever squad LeBron James is on. The rest of the East is just there to fill the void.</p>\n<p>In fact, excluding the lockout shortened 2011-12 season, the last time the East didn’t have at least one playoff team at or below .500 was all the way back in 2005!</p>\n<p>The last time the West had a team below .500 in a full season? All the way back in 1997. Back when Kobe Bryant hadn’t even grown his first afro. Back when Michael Jordan was still winning championships with the Bulls. That long ago.</p>\n<p>Nobody wants to see teams with losing records getting swept out of the first round like some sad formality. I know I don’t. I’m sure Charles Barkley doesn’t either. And his opinion matters.</p>\n<p>Why should OKC not get a chance to play in May with a record of 45-37 when you have the Brooklyn Nets six games under .500 at 38-44 getting a chance to upset the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks?</p>\n<p>And this brings me to my next point. Since teams in the East play three or four games against each other while they only play the West two times a year, how will we ever know how good the East really is?</p>\n<p>Sure, the Hawks can take the No. 1 seed going an impressive 60-22, but does that even mean anything? To me, it means that their strength of schedule was a whole lot easier than OKC’s. Who knows what Russell Westbrook and the Thunder could have accomplished if they were located just a couple states to the right.</p>\n<p>To prove my point, the aforementioned Brooklyn Nets, who entered their first round series with Atlanta with a sizable 22-win margin between the two teams, managed to send the series back to Atlanta for Game 5 tied 2-2.</p>\n<p>The Hawks have since taken a 3-2 lead, but let’s get one thing straight: home-court advantage or not, I don’t think Atlanta is scaring anyone in the conference finals. And we all know who is most likely going to be waiting for them there, unless the Bulls can finally get past “The King”.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Chicago has only helped prove my point even more, dropping two straight games to the extremely talented (not really) Milwaukee Bucks, who claimed the six seed with a 41-41 record.</p>\n<p>Where would these teams be if they had to play three or four games against Western Conference teams throughout the season? My guess is closer to the Lakers’ record these past two years. Sorry Laker fans, it hurts me, too.</p>\n<p>So the question of when, if ever, the NBA will reformat the playoff seeding structure to create a fairer set of matchups continues to be asked. Luckily for those poor fans of middling-Western-Conference-past who have had to look at the standings and say “Darn, we didn’t make it this year, but if we were in the East we would’ve had home-court advantage!” NBA commissioner Adam Silver has already claimed that he will be “looking into restructuring” the playoff structure.</p>\n<p>Why hasn’t this been looked into in the past? I blame David Stern, but then again I blame him for everything. I blame him for ruining the end of Kobe’s career, I blame him for making the Clippers the team to cheer for in L.A., I blame him for when I stubbed my toe getting out of the shower this morning. I wouldn’t be surprised if he and Donald Sterling were related, and I’m not sure if that even makes sense. I just don’t like the man.</p>\n<p>But on a more serious note, the end of this poorly-structured playoff setup may be nearing its end, or at least on its way to some improvements. Unless, of course, Silver is just biding his time until the conferences balance out a bit and he doesn’t have to change anything.</p>\n<p>Either way, I’m just happy I’m not a fan of a No. 9, 10, or 11 seed in the West that has to watch from home as a team like the Nets goes toe-to-toe with the East’s finest in Atlanta. I’m proud to cheer on my Lakers and their 14th-best standing in the West. Go big or go home, baby.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>First Round Just as Exciting as Ever</strong></p>\n<p><em>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</em></p>\n<p>Last year’s NBA Playoffs were definitely one to remember, especially in that first round that drew five game sevens. The action was exciting, there were quality teams and both Kevin Durant and Paul George were active and lively. There was nothing not to love about last year’s playoffs, but as we have moved to this year’s postseason, there is definitely a dissonance that has been ignited by the past action.</p>\n<p>NBA fans have become completely spoiled by the insanity that was first round last year and we have become unappreciative of the great basketball that is being played just before our eyes simply because more than half of the series aren’t headed to a sudden death game and the series are little more one-sided.</p>\n<p>What us fans need right now is to think back to before last year’s playoffs, when we were actually gracious for such a postseason. This year, everything is different and we should treat it as such, which means realizing how to enjoy this excitement from this year’s perspective.</p>\n<p>I mean just look at the No. 1 seeds this year, which held the sixth and eighth seeds in 2014 and took first round exits. We don’t even have any of the same players in the MVP race and three of the teams that made the conference finals last year (Miami, Indiana, Oklahoma City) didn’t even make it to the postseason.</p>\n<p>If you are like me and hail from SoCal, I hope that you were able to enjoy the Warriors vs. Pelicans series since it was actually a fun series. Yes, I know you’re tired of the Warriors and you’re afraid of the subsequent trash-talk from your NorCal housemates, but please don’t think that they walked through that series.</p>\n<p>The average margin of victory for Golden State in that series was just eight points over New Orleans. If the No. 1 seed in the conference with the NBA’s best record only beats the eighth seed by eight points a game, then the Western Conference must be as powerful as they say it is. Don’t let a series let you think otherwise simply because one team got swept.</p>\n<p>We got to see what kinds of things the mighty Warriors struggle with, such as guarding someone like Anthony Davis, who held the best stat line out of any player in the first round so far. He averaged 31.5 points, 11 boards, three blocks and a little over one steal while shooting 54 percent from the field in his first playoffs series ever. The kid really showed that he belongs not only in the league, but also in the places of the league where the lights shine the brightest.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Warriors there isn’t anyone else like A.D. in the NBA, but we’ll see how they can handle the duo of Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol.</p>\n<p>So on the West side of the bracket we had a sweep, but what about the East side? We had two of them and they were both even more interesting than the Warriors’ win.</p>\n<p>Washington took everybody by surprise after being the only team to snatch up any wins on the road and played even better when they got home, where they have struggled. The Wizards didn’t have much of a second half to their season, which led people to pick the Raptors to win or at least make the series go longer than four games. Washington showed up though and now has a record of 8-1 as the five seed in the last two years in the first round.</p>\n<p>The Cavs had the other sweep, and the hasty drama that followed made it all the more fun to watch. Although they won all four games, it got very chippy and the injury to K-Love could make that Celtics series hold a little more weight to the Cavs’ performance going forward.</p>\n<p>Away from these sweeps, we truly have many series that are playing out just how we love them to. There are still two series out East that have yet to be decided, and along with that, the Clippers and Spurs are making the Playoffs amazing on their own!</p>\n<p>Look, I know it’s not the same as last year’s playoffs but that doesn’t means it’s any less exciting, it’s just different. Let’s start being real fans again and enjoy what the league has in store for us.

\r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After the half, the game was a stalemate, with both teams sitting at 34 points.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Neither team was able to hold on to a lead bigger than four points, until the home team managed to gain a six-point advantage over Santa Barbara halfway through the third period. Directly after, the Gauchos struck back by going on a powerful 9-0 run to gain a three-point lead.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The score was tied once again at the end of the third quarter, all knotted up at 56.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The visitors opened up the forth on an 8-0 run, which included three pointers being scored by both freshman guard Sarah Bates and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar, with Bates again contributing 2 more points to cap off the run.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">CSUN wouldn’t lie down, though, as they kept the game close. Calling a timeout with 32 ticks on the clock left to play, Cal State Northridge went to their junior center Channon Fluker, who intensified the closeness of the game by scoring a clutch layup to create a 73-70 score at 20 seconds, UCSB still holding the lead.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After the score, sophomore guard Hayley Tanabe forced a turnover for the Gauchos and came up with the pivotal steal in crunch time and called a timeout immediately after the grab.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Down three points and going for the tie, the Matadors put the game in the hands of their junior guard Claudia Ramos, who’s three-point attempt ended up missing the mark.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After the three-pointer from Ramos fell short, Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman snagged the rebound. Upon grabbing the board, Edelman was fouled by Fluker.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">While at the charity stripe, Edelman missed her initial free throw attempt, but drained the second free throw with just four seconds left to play in regulation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The home team, with possession and no timeouts left, quickly inbounded the ball and gave it to Ramos, who splashed in a three-pointer to beat the final buzzer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Though exciting, the basket by Ramos was futile, as the final score was officially 74-73 at the end of regulation – with Santa Barbara taking the win.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">While UCSB had a slightly better field goal percentage (40.0%) than the Matadors (39.4%), the home team also won some standout stats the sheet. The most notable discrepancy between the Gauchos and their opponents was the domination of the points in the paint by the home team.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">CSUN scored a tremendous 48 points in the paint, compared to the less than half 22 points Santa Barbara had scored in the paint.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the game, Bates exploded for a team-leading 23 points for UCSB, going 6-11 from the field and shooting 5-7 from beyond the arc. Bates also led her team in assists, dishing out 5 dimes during regulation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior small forward Chaya Durr grabbed 9 boards, tying Matador junior center Channon Fluker for the game high in rebounds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For CSUN, senior forward Tessa Boagni scored a game-high 25 points, and her teammate Tanabe dispensed a game-high seven assists.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sitting at 3-0 in the conference, Santa Barbara looks to hold onto their streak in the Big West this weekend as they face UC Irvine on the road at Bren Events Center on Saturday January 13 at 7:00pm.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80546\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-11/ucsb-earns-close-road-win-to-remain-unbeaten-in-league-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80546\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-11/ucsb-earns-close-road-win-to-remain-unbeaten-in-league-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-11/ucsb-earns-close-road-win-to-remain-unbeaten-in-league-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-11/ucsb-earns-close-road-win-to-remain-unbeaten-in-league-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-11/ucsb-earns-close-road-win-to-remain-unbeaten-in-league-play/","id":844,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[843,842,841],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Full-Court Vision: UC Davis Comes Back To Beat UCSB’s Women’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-21-at-3.07.29-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-21-at-3.07.29-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Watch as the Gauchos fall to the Aggies in a showdown between the two top teams in the Big West Conference.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mR0LC65bpVo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Normally games are a tale of two halves, this one, was a game of two quarter.

However, UC Davis would bounce back with two baskets before the end of the quarter to only go down three points heading into the second.</p>\n<p>The Aggies then took their first lead of the night following a 4-0 run to begin the second to take the lead at 16-15 before Tal Sahar nailed a three to put the Gauchos back on top.</p>\n<p>After that however, it was all UC Davis who used a 16-6 run until the end of the second to take a 32-24 lead into the break. In the first quarter, the Gauchos had redshirt Morgan Bertsch held to zero points, but the Aggies star came alive in the second scoring eight points to help give her team the eight-point lead heading into the break.</p>\n<p>The third quarter began with UCSB and UC Davis trading buckets. With around four minutes remaining in the third, and UCSB down four, the Gauchos put together an 8-0 run to take a 48-43 lead. Like the first, the Aggies scored the final four points of the quarter to go down by just one heading into the fourth.</p>\n<p>Much like the second, in the final frame, Santa Barbara just could not buy a basket. After a make by senior guard Drea Toler which made the score 50-47 with 8:04 on the clock, UC Davis scored the next 12 points, fueled by a pair of three-pointers from junior guard Karley Eaton, to go up 59-50.</p>\n<p>UCSB tried to fight back with three points from freshman guard Sarah Bates and Toler but UC Davis was great from the charity stripe down the stretch, sealing the Gauchos fate as they lost 68-61 at the final buzzer.</p>\n<p>Neither team shot the three-ball particularly well, with the Gauchos hitting on just 25 percent (7-for-28) while the Aggies went 4-for-23 (17.4 percent) from beyond the arc. Overall, UC Davis went 26-for-58 (44.8 percent) from the field compared to a 33.9 percent (21-for-62) shooting night for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bertsch, despite shooting under her season average, still tallied a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds and was a huge factor down the strech.</p>\n<p>Following two straight losses, albeit competitive ones, the Gauchos now know they need to make some quick fixes if they dont want to fall into a deep losing streak like they did earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the return of a guard like Toler could provide the offense a much needed passing boost. She finished with a team-high 15 points in her home debut.</p>\n<p>UCSB is back in action on Saturday against Long Beach State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-21/full-court-vision-uc-davis-comes-back-to-beat-ucsbs-womens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-21/full-court-vision-uc-davis-comes-back-to-beat-ucsbs-womens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-21/full-court-vision-uc-davis-comes-back-to-beat-ucsbs-womens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-21/full-court-vision-uc-davis-comes-back-to-beat-ucsbs-womens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-21/full-court-vision-uc-davis-comes-back-to-beat-ucsbs-womens-basketball/","id":845,"author":{"id":48,"name":"Johnny Mandaville"},"related":[844,843,842],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
