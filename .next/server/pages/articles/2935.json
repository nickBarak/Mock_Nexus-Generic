Internal Vice President Steven Ho and External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect (EVPSA) Mayela Morales – were removed due to Title IX-related violations and “unprofessionalism that has come to light,” according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The two were removed from the party during summer 2018, the statement said. This is the first time the Isla Vista Party publicly announced the decision.</p>\n<p>According to Ho, he was first informed of his removal by the social media posts.</p>\n<p>“I was unaware of my removal until the statement released by leadership of the party,” he said.</p>\n<p>When Ho reached out to party leadership to discuss the matter, he was told “that someone was supposed to talk to me and poor communication within the party resulted in that not happening.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Party did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>Morales declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> from the EVPSA position after it was discovered she was not enrolled at UC Santa Barbara during Spring Quarter 2018. She currently serves as the Parliamentarian for the A.S. Senate and as the Chief of Staff for the Office of the Student Advocate.</p>\n<p>In the statement, the Isla Vista Party (IVP) apologized for not previously announcing the removal of the two members and “for contributing to community members feeling unsafe in student government spaces due to this.”</p>\n<p>This is the second instance of separation between parties and high-profile members to occur during winter break.

During her recently previously held position as Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services, she oversaw admissions, registrar, financial aid and early academic outreach.</p>\n<p>During Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s campus announcement on Jacob’s appointment last week, Yang said Jacob is well versed in the nuances and challenges of working within education and has received numerous campus recognitions during her career.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate Dr. Jacob’s longstanding dedication to our campus and especially our students,” Yang said. “Dr. Jacob has been deeply engaged in education-related activities at the national and international levels as well. She has been recognized with a UCSB Staff Citation for Excellence Award, and a Margaret T. Getman Service to Students Award.”</p>\n<p>OISS Director Simran Singh said he has worked with Jacob since 2002 and that her past work with the university has demonstrated that she is an excellent administrator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen her in action,” Singh said. “She’s … able to keep many different sets of needs in mind as she makes decisions.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position. – Former Vice Chancellor Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob said her time with OISS introduced her to a broad range of operations on campus that have prepared her to assume the duties involved with leading the Student Affairs Division.</p>\n<p>“During that time I got to understand how the Graduate Division operates and how Student Affairs operates, so that gave me a very broad training,” said Jacob.</p>\n<p>Jacob also said her time with the Student Academic Support Services and Enrollment Services gave her the necessary skillset and experience she will need to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I got greater in-depth experience within the division and on budget processes … through my work as the Executive Director and Associate Dean for Student Academic Support Services and in my current role as the Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young, who first met Jacob when she was a candidate for the position of Director of the OISS 19 years ago, said her career thus far at the university makes her an ideal fit for the position.</p>\n<p>“She’s had departmental experience as the department head, she’s had responsibility as a patrol point, she’s a senior administrator in the leadership of the Division and has been so for a number of years,” Young said. “I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position.”</p>\n<p>While her work with Young has helped prepare her to receive the chancellor’s offer to serve as Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Jacob said she was still surprised when she got the call to take on Young’s position.</p>\n<p>“[Young] has an executive group that works with him, and I’ve been a part of that group for a number of years, so I knew that he felt I was prepared if I was asked to be in this position on an interim basis,” Jacob said. “I was prepared if I were asked, but on another level I was surprised when I got a call from the chancellor.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students. – Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob also said Young has been an extraordinary leader and will be a hard act to follow.</p>\n<p>“He’s leaving enormous shoes behind to fill, and I’m going to do my best to fill them as much as I can in the time that I’m in the position,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>According to Jacob, she will continue to promote the “inclusive” campus climate and support services available to students during Young’s career.</p>\n<p>“I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young said he trusts Jacob to take on his role, but will be available with his expertise if she needs it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve told her that I won’t be around to interfere or meddle in her affairs, but I’m a phone call way or an email away for a point of view or more likely information — some detail that would be helpful to her,” Young said.</p>\n<p>According to Young, the campus community has a good future ahead of it with Jacob as its Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>“I’m prepared to be helpful in any way that she needs, but I can tell you that the campus — particularly the staff in Division of Students Affairs and the students that we serve through our programs and our initiatives — are well served with Mary Jacob as the Acting Vice Chancellor.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The products are located in all of the Chi-5 residence halls, including San Nicholas Hall (above). <em>Courtesy of Wiki Commons</em></p></div>\n<p>The program is currently limited to the Channel Island 5 residence halls – Anacapa Hall, Santa Cruz Hall, Santa Rosa Hall, San Miguel Hall and San Nicholas Hall – but hopes to expand to Manzanita Village and the Santa Catalina Towers during Winter Quarter 2019.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz Hall Representative-At-Large Michelle Chang first proposed the idea during the 2017-2018 school year. The initiative was continued this year by Programming Vice President Austin Rowe of the Residential Housing Association (RHA).</p>\n<p>Rowe says the point of the Period Pantry is simple: to “provide a large amount of free menstrual hygiene products in all female-identified and gender-neutral restrooms in the residence halls for anyone who needs them to use.”</p>\n<p>The program provides plastic boxes, located in each of the Channel Island 5 residence halls, stocked with a variety of period products for residents.</p>\n<p>According to Rowe, the Pantry began last year in San Nicolas and San Miguel, but it wasn’t until Fall Quarter 2018 that the program began in full with the addition of Period Peers. The peers are student volunteers who are responsible for restocking the restrooms daily.</p>\n<p>Each volunteer is assigned to a particular restroom in their respective residential halls. They have a bag of excess pads and tampons distributed by RHA at the ready so they can restock the boxes as regularly as possible.</p>\n<p>The Period Peer program is completely volunteer-based. Kaitlyn Medland, San Miguel RHA President and member of the Internal Committee for the Period Pantry, was in charge of gathering volunteers for the program in San Miguel Hall.</p>\n<p>The selection process was very much on a first come, first served basis, Medland said.</p>\n<p>Medland and Rowe both described the implementation of the Period Pantry as an administrative and student-led process.</p>\n<p>After Chang’s initial proposal, all the presidents, representatives-at-large and other special positions from each residential hall gathered to discuss the motion and vote for whether it would receive RHA funding or not.</p>\n<p>The members ultimately voted yes, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“The way I see it, the Period Pantry is making the most of our residents’ funds, giving them easy access to a wide range of supplies,” Rowe said.</p>\n<p>And thus far, it seems that students are on board with the program, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve actually heard a lot of people say that it’s really neat that we’re offering these supplies,” she said. “We have the free condom boxes and yet we [didn’t] have free menstrual supplies even though … you can’t stop your period.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/","id":2933,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2932,2931,2930],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Finance and Business Committee met Monday night to hear funding requests from 26 campus organizations.<br><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met to hear from 26 different organizations funding requests on Monday night.</p>\n<p>Sixteen organizations received the full funding for their requests, while seven received partial funding and three received none. Groups that were partially funded included Sigma Chi Omega, Raices De Mi Tierra, Dance Marathon, the Hong Kong Student Association, Alpha Kappa Psi, Theta Nu Kappa and the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega requested funding for $5,800 and received $2,669 for their 17th annual Multicultural Show Feb 21 in Campbell Hall. According to committee member Nadia Blant, Campbell Hall is an expensive venue to fund, therefore the committee deferred on funding the entire event.</p>\n<p>“I think the venue is super expensive and because they are multicultural, there is a lot of places they could go,” Blant said, “I think we need to cut if we are going to make all these events work, so I would fund the venue but not the performing actors.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Raices De Mi Tierra received $12,000 from their requested $15,200, while Dance Marathon requested $4,350 and received $4,150 when the committee decided not to give them $200 in material costs for the event on Feb 28 at Pavilion Gym. Dance Marathon Chair Sean Thompson, who asked for funding from the committee, said Dance Marathon is “the largest collegiate charity in the nation and is present in over 250 campuses nationwide.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB. – Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We work through Children’s Miracle Network, which is a network of hospitals that are children’s hospitals and our local chapter is Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Hospital, so all of the proceeds through our Dance Marathon event go to them,” Thompson said, “My favorite part is that we bring the kids from the hospital too, so you get to meet them, dance with them and play with them.”</p>\n<p>The Hong Kong Student Association asked for $3,970 and received $1,120 for the annual Lunar New Year festival on Feb. 12 at Storke Plaza and are expecting about 200 people. According to Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam, the event’s purpose is to “emulate the festival atmosphere of a traditional Asian Lunar New Year festival by bringing UCSB our cultural foods, performances, music, games and activities.”</p>\n<p>“Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB,” Tam said.</p>\n<p>Alpha Kappa Psi received $242 from their requested $282, the $40 difference due to the committee’s inability to fund water bottles for a Coffee and Donuts event on Feb 26 in the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge.</p>\n<p>“We are hosting a professional development night open to all students. We will be hosting workshops that help fill resumes, give interview tips, stuff like that,” said a speaker for Alpha Kappa Psi.</p>\n<p>Theta Nu Kappa’s speaker third-year feminist studies and political science major Derek Wakefield received $410 for a Quidditch tournament after the committee could not fund them $75 for water bottles.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing in a sport that has never been seen, except for with the Quidditch team, but they have not had as many really wide open tournaments open at the university,” Wakefield said. “We want to make this an event that can really persist throughout the years and be something that you know people think, ‘Oh I am going to go to the Quidditch tournament like it becomes a Santa Barbara staple.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60141\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60141\" data-attachment-id=\"60141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-hears-requests/finance-board/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422350836\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Finance Board\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60141\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=440%2C293\" alt=\"A.S.

We have thousands and thousands of specimens, mammals, birds, so if you haven’t been there it pretty cool you should check it out,” a speaker for the Wildlife Society said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Surfriders received the requested $2,500 for Concert for the Coast on May 30 at Anisq’Oyo’ Park where proceeds will go towards the Environmental Defense Center.</p>\n<p>“We have ocean-friendly gardens and we want people to participate in that and are trying to change their grass lawns into really efficient ways to collect ocean runoff and to prevent pollution from the streets from going into the ocean,” a speaker for Surfriders said, “We also have a ‘Rise above Plastics’ campaign and we want to gain awareness about that.”</p>\n<p>Reel Loud was not given funding for their $12,000 request for the 23rd Annual Film Festival that will take place May 22, as it was unclear where the money they would make off of the event would go.
