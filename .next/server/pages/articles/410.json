It’s very prestigious.”</p>\n<p>That list of former participants includes the names of tennis legends such as Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith and Brad Gilbert, as well as former Gauchos Cory Guy and Simon Shen. Starting today, junior Alex Johnson, sophomore Ben Recknagel and seniors Alex Konigsfeldt and Evan Jurgensen,  look to emulate Guy and Shen, but such a task is easier said than done.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This is the second strongest tournament we play,” Davis said. “It’s an opportunity for the guys to beat nationally-ranked players. If they all do that they’ll get a chance to make the NCAA singles.”</p>\n<p>One Gaucho in particular will be looking to continue to build his name up on the national stage. Sophomore Ben Recknagel made it to the Round of 16 a week ago at the ITA Regionals, beating USC’s 90th-ranked Peter Lucassen, along the way. If he continues to play well against nationally ranked players, he will earn a ranking of his own and a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We know he’s going to play one of the [players who makes it past the qualifiers] on Thursday,” Davis said. “That’s always tough because they have already played a couple games. If he wins that he then has a rematch with Peter Lucassen, who he beat at Regionals. It’s a tough draw psychologically, but we’re looking for him to win this thing.”</p>\n<p>Despite the implications of the potential match, Recknagel is not concerned.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously going to be tougher to beat him a second time around,” Recknagel said. “He’s going to prepare for me differently now that he knows I’m good. I know how to play him so I just hope I can beat him again.”</p>\n<p>The tournament will consist of 32 players from schools including UCLA, USC, UCI, UCSB, Denver, Loyola Marymount, BYU and UCSD. USC’s Daniel Nguyen, the #1 seed and runner-up of the ITA Regionals, will also be participating. Sixteen players, including Recknagel and senior Alex Konigsfeldt, will automatically be accepted into the main draw, while the others, including senior Evan Jurgensen and junior Alexander Johnson, will play qualifying matches on Wednesday to determine if they will make the main draw.</p>\n<p>“The level of competitions in the qualifiers is going to be high,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>There will also be a doubles bracket, Recknagel pairing up with Konigsfeldt and Johnson with Jurgensen. Doubles play was a weak point for the Gauchos in the ITA regionals, and they need to step up this week if they want to hold on to a chance to make the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to see somebody pop,” Davis said. “We’re going to continue to experiment with pairings and hopefully we’ll find somebody this week. We think that Alex and Evan could be a good pair.”</p>\n<p>This five-day tournament comes just a week after the grueling, six-day-long ITA Regionals, and some people might be worried that fatigue would be a problem for the Gauchos. However, neither Davis nor Recknagel are worried, and both are certain that it won’t be a problem.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody’s feeling a lot better,” Davis said. “The guys made it and survived midterms. I think we’ll feel a lot better psychologically this time.”</p>\n<p>The first matches for the Gauchos will be Jurgensen’s and Johnson’s qualifying matches Wednesday morning. Johnson will face UC Irvine’s Steven Henderson while Jurgensen faces Tyler Loong of BYU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/","id":410,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[409,408,407],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg","biography":"Not available","articles":[286,294,298,299,410,422,425,430,1687,2124,2127,2130,2137,2139,2287,2304,2786,2808,2865,2871,2894,2897,3055,3145,3500,3501,4518,4529,5174,5175,5176,5177,5178,5180,5181,5182,5184,5188,5212,5216,5221,5222,5223,5224,5225,5226,5227,5228,5229,5235,5255,5256,5257,5463,5464,5466,5552],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos’ Foul Troubles End with Losses at Pepperdine and Wyoming, Host Santa Clara on Tuesday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A total of 59 personal fouls and its inability to make free throws landed the UCSB women's basketball team with losses to Pepperdine and Wyoming over the weekend.

They combined for 46 points on 18-35 shooting and made 9-15 attempts at the free throw line. Green led the team with 24 points and was 5-5 at the line while Ogwumike scored 22 points and was 4-10 shooting free throws.</p>\n<p>Compared to Pepperdine’s field goal percentage of 35 percent and its three-point percentage of 20 percent, UCSB had a stronger performance shooting, 41.4 percent from the field and meagerly were better from three with a 28.6 percentage.</p>\n<p>However, the Waves’ 71.1 free throw percentage was better than Santa Barbara’s 55.6 percentage and proved to be the deciding factor in Sunday’s game.</p>\n<p>Leading the Waves’ 11-2 run to begin the game was Ogwumike with seven points. Despite allowing the scoring run, a make from beyond the arc by Roper sparked UCSB’s 11-0 run to take a 13-11 lead, forced a Pepperdine timeout and eventually ended with a 15-15 tie to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ 28-27 lead with 2:35 left in the second quarter would be their last of the game. But jumpshots by Jones and sophomore forward Chaya Durr resulted in UCSB trailing 32-33 at the end of the first half. Durr registered a game-high 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s 10-point, 48-38 lead was its largest of the game at the 3:21 mark of the third quarter.  Contributing to the lead was the duo of Green and Ogwumike, scoring 17 points. The Waves’ lead lasted until the 1:43 mark of the quarter but was trimmed to 48-54 by UCSB’s 6-1 run to end the third.</p>\n<p>Two layups by Jones for UCSB, a layup by Ogwumike and a free throw for Pepperdine were scored to start the fourth quarter prior to neither team scoring for nearly the next two minutes.</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Pepperdine found itself in foul trouble as well, committing a total of 28 fouls. But, ending the game’s scoreless streak was Roper, making a pair of free throws. Her ability to make free throws was most crucial in the fourth quarter as she made 10-11 and scored 14 points in the quarter.</p>\n<p>A missed layup by Pepperdine freshman guard Kayla Blair led to senior Dioseline Lopez scoring a layup to bring the Gauchos within two at 69-71. This prompted Santa Barbara’s plan to intentionally foul which landed Ogwumike at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Ogwumike missed both free throw attempts while Jones grabbed the rebound for UCSB and led to the Gauchos calling a timeout with five seconds remaining in regulation. With little time remaining, Lopez attempted a game-winning three-pointer but came up short as UCSB loss 69-71.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has struggled to consistently knock down free throws in each game so far this season. Its 53.3 free throw percentage on Friday certainly was an influence in its loss.</p>\n<p>Season-highs in scoring, field goal and three-point percentage still weren’t enough in UCSB’s contest against Wyoming on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 50 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from behind the three-point line to score 67 points, but a series of scoring runs in the second half and their ability to make free throws helped the Cowgirls defeat UCSB 76-67. Wyoming made 27-35 free throws for a 77.1 percentage.</p>\n<p>It was a career night for freshman shooting guard Coco Miller, recording career-highs with 24 points, four steals, and two blocks.</p>\n<p>A total of four Wyoming players scored 12 or more points on Friday. The Cowgirls established their offensive dominance early, opening the first quarter with a 10-2 run. Wyoming outscored UCSB 19-8 to finish the quarter. Combining for 12 of the team’s points were senior guard Marquelle Dent and freshman forward Marta Gomez. They ended the first with six points apiece as Dent shot 3-3 and Gomez went 2-3 from long distance.</p>\n<p>Dent led Wyoming in points with 17 and had a game-high six assists while Gomez was just one-point behind her lead with 16.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara a just three fouls in the first quarter but would commit many more through the second quarter and beyond, allowing Wyoming to build upon its lead at the free throw line. Wyoming’ largest lead of 15 points appeared in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB responded with a 9-0 run of its own to trim the Cowgirls’ lead to 21-27. Scoring Santa Barbara’s last five points to close the quarter was Miller as the Gauchos trailed 28-34 to head into halftime. Her performance in the second quarter was most pivotal as she scored 10 of her 24 points.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to bring Wyoming’s lead within a single figure deficit, the emergence of senior guard Jordan Kelley to start the second half increased the Cowgirls’ lead back to double digits. She scored Wyoming’s first seven points to begin the third quarter to extend their lead to 41-31. Kelley concluded the game with 13 points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Helping UCSB to counter Wyoming’s scoring was its bench, outscoring the Cowgirls 26-9. Providing a career-high 11 points off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris to go along with a team-high five rebounds.</p>\n<p>An 8-0 run to close out the third quarter helped UCSB reduce Wyoming’s lead as a three-point basket by Miller brought Santa Barbara within four at 51-55. But the Gauchos found themselves down by double-figures at the start of the fourth quarter as Wyoming went on a 7-0 run to take a 62-51 lead with 8:17 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB’s 11 steals was its second-highest this season, Wyoming‘s 14 free throw attempts in the fourth quarter was its most throughout the entirety of the game and ultimately led the Cowgirls to their 76-67 win over UCSB. Dent shot all nine of her free throw attempts in the quarter, making seven and scoring nine points in the fourth. Nearly perfect from the line was sophomore guard Liv Roberts, finishing 8-9 at the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin the month of December hosting Santa Clara this Tuesday in the Thunderdome at 7:00 p.m. Currently on a four-game winning streak, the Broncos are 4-2 overall and beat UCSB 47-33 in last season’s matchup in Santa Barbara.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-foul-troubles-end-with-losses-at-pepperdine-and-wyoming-host-santa-clara-on-tuesday/","id":407,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[406,405,404],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Fourth Straight, Tied For First In Conf.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womensbball-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/womensbball-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team earned its fourth consecutive win in its 74-62 defeat of Hawaii Saturday night.

The six rebounds were a season-high for Jemerigbe to go along with 11 points and six assists. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler posted career-high totals with 17 points and two three-point makes.</p>\n<p>It was all UCSB to open the first quarter as the Gauchos shot 69.2 percent from the field and 4-for-5 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>The inside-outside game of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter was in full effect. Porter continued her hot shooting from the last two games, starting 3-for-3 from behind the perimeter. She would end the game 3-for-4 from the field and play just 10 minutes after enduring an apparent shoulder injury.</p>\n<p>Playing a major role in the Gauchos’ commanding start was their defense as Hawaii ended the period with five turnovers, in which UCSB capitalized off of with 11 points.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing by double-figures 23-9, it was the shooting of junior guard Sarah Toeaina that kept Hawaii within range of reducing its deficit all game. She went 3-for-6 in the first period, signaling the start of her finishing with a game-high 22 points on a 10-for-19 shooting afternoon.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second period, no basket was made by either team until the 6:41 mark for UCSB on a jumpshot by Toler to give UCSB a 25-15 lead.</p>\n<p>She was the Gauchos’ most active player in the period, scoring another basket as a result of a quick stop and go move to surpass the defender for a go-ahead layup and later earned a chase down block before eventually being subbed out.</p>\n<p>Toeaina remained the Rainbow Wahine’s primary source of offense with a jumpshot to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 27-21.</p>\n<p>With under two minutes remaining in the period, the Gauchos got back to feeding Edelman down low as she scored layups in the team’s last two possessions.</p>\n<p>A crucial three-pointer by sophomore forward Lahnia Salanoa brought Hawaii to its lowest first half deficit of five points, 31-26, to go into halftime.</p>\n<p>Jumpstarting Hawaii’s offense to its 7-2 run to open the second half was freshman guard Julissa Tago with a three-pointer and midrange jumpshot along the baseline. Tying the game at 33 apiece was Toeaina’s layup with 8:06 left in the third.</p>\n<p>Despite her reduced role this season, junior guard Makala Roper provided a quick surge off the bench with a three-pointer to end the tie and put UCSB up 36-33.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB maintained a lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Roper’s shot ignited the Gauchos’ 12-4 run that led to Hawaii calling a 20 second timeout.</p>\n<p>Providing a scoring outburst during the run was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez which included back-to-back three-pointers, increasing UCSB’s lead to 45-37, she scored all eight of her points in the quarter while shooting 3-for-5 and 2-for-4 from deep.</p>\n<p>Hawaii took advantage of UCSB’s scoreless play in the final 3:54 of the third as Toeaina would score two consecutive layups to help the Rainbow Wahine enter the game’s final period down 50-45.</p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, UCSB looked like the team it was to open the game as its grittiness was on full display as it embarked on an 8-0 run. Its offense was most efficient in the period, shooting 72.7 percent and 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>An offensive charge led to the Gauchos’ first possession. Scoring five of the eight was Edelman, putting her pivot foot to work and posting up for a turnaround AND-1 layup in which she converted at the foul line.</p>\n<p>Scoring the other three in the team’s next possession was Jemerigbe’s drive and circus layup that fell as she drew a foul that led to her making a free-throw to increase Santa Barbara’s lead to 58-45.</p>\n<p>A three-point make by Toler extended UCSB’s run to 11-3, but responding with a three of her own was senior guard Briana Harris to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 61-51.</p>\n<p>But the three-point shot wouldn’t be Toler’s last as she scored 10 points straight to give UCSB a 68-57 advantage.</p>\n<p>A quick jumpshot by Toeaina trimmed Santa Barbara’s lead to 66-57, but the Rainbow Wahine were unable to draw any closer as time continued to expire.</p>\n<p>With a 10-point lead of 68-58, helping secure the Gauchos’ 74-62 win was the veteran leadership of Jemerigbe. With the ball at the top of the key as time went by, Jemerigbe drove the right lane for a layup, came up with a steal in the game’s lasting seconds, and was clutch with a 4-for-7 finish at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>With its three-game home stand now over, UCSB will be on the road at Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, Jan. 25.

Lao won the best of three sets series and defeated two-time defending champion Sanchez 6-2; 3-6; 6-2.  Due to poor weather conditions in San Diego, the final was moved to Los Angeles and played at USC Marks Stadium.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB failed to advance far in the tournament, the Gauchos scraped a couple wins against the best competition they will see all season. In the opening round of the singles bracket, freshman Kiersten Meehan didn’t allow her opponent to score in the first set, defeating Pepperdine sophomore Tara Panu in straight sets 6-0; 6-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Pepperdine usually has a good team, it was good to beat one of their girls,” Meehan said. “Regionals are a big deal.
