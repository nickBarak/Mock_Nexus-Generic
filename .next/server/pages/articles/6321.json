Reflecting on two recent news items, Joshen Mantai insists that they are anything but. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our day and age, it seems young adults are under a microscope when it comes to defining their future success. Businesses, universities and employers all share a vision that </span><a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2377-social-media-hiring.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not readily accept young members of society</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who are deemed to hold socially unacceptable views. This makes it hard for young adults, especially those who have a large social platform, to hide the evolution of their opinions and past mistakes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, several news stories seem to have arisen in relation to young people’s past mistakes — whether they are inappropriate comments, ideals or pictures. While adults are quick to jump to the conclusion that we teenagers are solely to blame for sharing these thoughts on our social media platforms in the first place, some of the blame seems to lie in the creation of social media itself — and its dangerous ability to make us feel overly comfortable sharing on what we falsely believe is a private medium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the creation of social media is not the only aspect to which blame can be attributed.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Kashuv has since apologized on his social media, </span><a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/6/18/parkland-student-rescinded-harvard-2023/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">informing Harvard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has “grown” since the incident and that the comments were made “in private among equally immature high school students.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashuv’s defensive attitude does demonstrate an important point that many adults in our society fail to recognize: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging adults’ brains <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/neuroscience-of-20-somethings-brain-young-adults_n_1840495\">continue to develop well into their 20s</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many members of our generation willingly recognize our mistakes and grow from them, but Kashuv misses the bigger picture in his apology: Racism is not something that can be simply brushed off as a mistake — it’s a form of serious bigotry. Kashuv’s claim that he has grown from comments made just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">years ago is not the best defense. His statement not only ignorantly assumes that most high school students hold the same “immature” views as he did, but it also unfairly equates immaturity to acts of discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, comparing the opinions and mindsets of my 17-year-old self to those of my 19-year-old self does not reveal much variation — I still hold the same values of acceptance, environmental advocacy, etcetera as I did before. Sure, I have </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">matured </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over the last two years, but I have maintained the same core values of human decency in recognizing that we’re all humans regardless of the color of our skin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where I think some young adults of our generation go wrong: They brush off problematic dispositions as easily forgivable because others around us shared the same opinions or because these comments were made in “private,” when we are all aware of the traceability of our social media footprint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, it may seem like most young adults share the view that our past mistakes should not define our future chances at success, as we all have flaws. But this view should depend not only on the severity of our past mistakes but also on how we go about explaining them to the stakeholders who have the power to decide our futures. Kyle Kashuv failed in both of these areas. Harvard made the right move by standing its ground on rescinding Kashuv’s acceptance. It sends a message to all young adults to wake up and be conscious of the public display of their opinions and conveys that students with racist attitudes should not be accepted into universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is only prevalently displayed in our media today because Kashuv has such a wide platform, past mistakes can define any student. </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/18/what-leads-harvard-rescind-admission-racism-plagiarism-killing-your-mom/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2eb09e2ca060\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard has dropped numerous students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> accused of sexual misconduct, those who have plagiarized and others who have made sexist and racist comments. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Harvard’s revealment of students’ true moral character is honorable, not all students who have exhibited these behaviors have been caught. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my time at UCSB, I’ve heard of students writing notes on their Scantrons prior to exams, seen students using Google on their phones at the end of exams and witnessed racist exchanges and unwanted sexual advances, among other behaviors.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the blame seems to lie in the creation of social media itself — and its dangerous ability to make us feel overly comfortable sharing on what we falsely believe is a private medium.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This brings up the issue of fairness. If students who have been caught cheating have had their admission revoked, what about the rest of the students who are admitted and cheat their whole way through college? Will future employers be able to see through these candidates in a short interview, or will they hire said candidates in the place of someone more deserving? This unfortunately seems like an issue that can only punish those who get caught and serve as a cautious warning to others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard’s policy on revoking admission also dangerously assumes that issues of plagiarism should be equated to much more serious issues of racism and sexual assault. Cheating on a quiz should not result in the same expulsory punishment as sexual harassment and discrimination. While cheating results in inhibiting one’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">own</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> personal success, harrassment and discrimination unequivocally affect </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in damaging ways. Therefore, it is not just up to us to hold ourselves accountable. It’s also the job of these institutions to mold a system that ensures fairness and a more in-depth evaluation of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashuv’s mistake was a very specific incident that does not shed light on all the problems our generation is tasked with fixing. Recently, more women and female stars have been facing criticism for taking private photos which have leaked, negatively affecting their public image. This is most evident in the case of </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/21/18693604/bella-thorne-nude-photos-whoopi-goldberg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bella Thorne.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When hackers stole and threatened to release her nude photos, she released the photos herself before the blackmailers could. Whoopi Goldberg’s public disapproval of Thorne taking nude photos in the first place created a media storm when Goldberg said, “If you’re famous, I don’t care how old you are. You don’t take nude pictures of yourself.” While many agreed with Goldberg’s reaction, Thorne argued that Goldberg was unfairly shaming young women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Goldberg importantly points out the necessity of being aware of what follows us on our “cloud,” her comments shaming Thorne are problematic because they take the attention away from the bigger problem at hand: the objectification of women’s bodies and how they are consistently used against them. Women are encouraged to be more confident about their bodies — yet are shamed when they embrace them. In this and many other situations, women have been painted as the perpetrators of their own downfall, instead of the victims of these situations. Thorne doesn’t deserve to be shamed in the media because she was the victim of a photo hack that didn’t harm anyone, in sharp contrast to the damaging comments made by Kashuv. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the bigger question is how to ensure women’s privacy is no longer violated instead of scapegoating them. The issue of leaked photos reveals the intricacy of young adults’ past mistakes — and how it is crucial to consider the complexity of those mistakes when determining whether or not they should affect someone’s future. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants you to be aware of how your actions could affect your future or someone else’s.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

From </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/books/astro-poets-twitter.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter accounts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dedicated to posting daily horoscopes with half a million followers to </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drunkstrology/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pages that relate the signs to viral memes, astrology has long since graduated from the back pages of printed newspapers and taken on a life — and cult following — of its own. From Urban Outfitters graphic tees to dating apps, it has infiltrated nearly all domains of social life — I recently came across a Tinder bio that read, “Add me on Co-Star.” It seems as though the astrology obsession has become a cultural norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the initial weeks after I downloaded the app, I let the daily horoscope notifications pile up. I dismissed them as corny platitudes (“Drastic times call for drastic measures” or “You can give them a chance today”) and eventually let them get lost in the mix of breaking news headlines and Facebook event notifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then suddenly, the stars aligned and my horoscope started to get it absolutely right — almost disturbingly so. On the day Co-Star sent me, “If you want people to communicate with your heart, you have to teach them the language it speaks in,” my sister and I had just resolved a week-long fight. When I received, “It’s time to grow past your fundamental injuries from when your primary caregivers failed to understand you,” it reminded me to stop wallowing and pull my head out of my ass. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instantly, I was hooked. I gave myself to the trusting hands of the cosmos. Doubts of “this is literally just a company who pays people to write these” and “it’s all about perception” got squashed by the immediate rush of validation and satisfaction I got from reading and confirming for the first time what a true Sagittarius I apparently was: headstrong, stubborn and spontaneous to a fault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself. That I didn’t need unique passions or interests because everybody seemed to already have their own ideas of who a Sagittarius was. It was more comforting than I cared to admit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day, I would screenshot my horoscope and send it my friends, exclaiming, “That’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> me!” while hundreds of thousands of other Co-Star users did the same thing, claiming the generic platitude as their own. Still, it would give me an extra boost of confidence that would stay with me throughout the day.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-Star allows you to lean into a list of traits that the Internet says makes you a “total Virgo” and base your identity, quirks and strengths on a personality that has already been curated for you. For a time, it made being 20 seem simple. These accurate (or what coincidentally happened to be accurate) horoscopes gave me a sense of control over my life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world. It asserts itself as a philosophy without room for doubt and provides a self-assured confidence that is extremely attractive. The 12 sun signs — based on birth month — are taken not as suggestions or fortunes, but as permanent and reliable fixtures in our society, each with their own set of “individualized” principles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stopped being a die-hard believer in astrology when I started to notice discrepancies between myself and what my sign was supposed to be. </span><a href=\"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/zodiac-signs/sagittarius/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sagittariuses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are generous, idealistic, extroverted, cursed with an insatiable case of wanderlust and truth-seeking. They are “independent and strong-willed,” “natural born leaders,” “seductive” and “trailblazing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are wildly broad claims that feel more descriptive of a video game character than a real person. I don’t know anyone, let alone myself, who embodies </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of these statements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a defense for these blanket statements: the generalized qualities of the sun signs only scratch the surface of astrology. Apparently, your moon sign explains it all. And to figure out your moon sign you need to know what time you were born.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know what time I was born because I’m adopted, so I tried to deduce my moon sign by process of elimination. Each day, I read the horoscopes of all the moon signs and took note on which felt the most accurate. By the end of my two-week trial, 168 horoscopes later, I came to the conclusion that a Gemini moon seemed a likely fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of this pseudo-experiment, I discovered I still had the same nagging feeling of incompleteness that I had when I first started. I didn’t feel a loyalty to any of the signs and was even beginning to doubt whether my Sagittarius-ness held any value. The fact that a Leo moon tended to gravitate to the spotlight more than a Cancer felt like arbitrary information, even silly. I didn’t possess the authority to claim I belonged to one over the other because I still didn’t have anything to prove it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d spent too much of my time and energy in the world of astrology to come out feeling just as confused as I had at the beginning. It felt like I was promised clarity on the condition that I figured out my birth time, and only then would I be able to access this wealth of knowledge about myself. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A part of me knew that it wouldn’t have mattered anyway. This piece of myself I’d attached so much value to and made myself feel guilty for not knowing was trivial. What was more revealing than anything was how far I had let myself spiral into an astrology obsession. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My faith was based on insecurity. I wanted (and still want) to fast-forward through my bumbling 20s and college years to this fully developed version of myself that doesn’t exist. I wanted it to be as easy as picking an avatar in a game, complete with attractive, likeable traits I didn’t have to work for or even think about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought I could use astrology as a cure-all for my doubts and anxieties about the future. For reconciling the contradictions in my personality, justifying habits of self-sabotage, for not feeling like I was not 100% any one quality. Surely one day I would develop into the full-blown Sagittarius I was if I just believed a little more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe me, I tried. I based entire relationships on whether our signs were compatible or not. Even worse, I judged other people for not believing in it too, this dogma based on fear and escapism posing as cute personality traits and trendy finger tattoos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of this summer, I realized I was cheating myself. I had avoided engaging and actually thinking about my choices and beliefs for an embarrassingly long time. Where I had once felt confident claiming all the ways I was “such a Sagittarius,” this persona began to feel meaningless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I did see clearly was how quickly I blindly attached myself to this belief in astrology. It was something to grasp onto, something that promised answers and truths that I became convinced I would never find without it. It assuaged feelings of self-doubt and social anxiety. I was learning to love the provided answers; I was learning to love not being me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little by little, I am learning how to relinquish my grip on astrology. </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff astrologer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/broadly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Annabel Gat, puts it simply: “It’s a tool for self-reflection, it’s not a religion or a science. It’s just a way to look at the world and a way to think about things.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realize that for most people, astrology doesn’t evolve into this type of unhealthy obsession and codependency. But I do question the underlying and often subconscious motivations of its young target audience. I do question its ability to influence its followers into a kind of group-think that poses as innocent, harmless fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying into astrology meant being content living my life like a game of Sims on autopilot. A choose-your-own-adventure, but even lazier because someone else had already chosen all the adventures for me. And that’s what astrology became for me: a way to escape my own life by stepping into an already-lived one. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After overcoming her astrology

it’s extremely easy to fall out of your depressed break-up funk and into someone’s bed — that is, rebound sex is not hard to come by. It’s no surprise that rebound sex happens frequently — studies show that about one-third of college students will engage in rebound sex within a month of their breakup. Those numbers are probably even higher on a campus like ours. And, in some cases, rebound sex can be harmless. You wham, you bam, you thank your ma’am and it’s all out of your system. Look at you, getting on with your life.</p>\n<p>But is it really beneficial? Does it help ease the pain of a lost love? Unfortunately, there are no valid studies out there to show whether or not rebound sex helps anybody. All we can go on is personal experience.  And, of course, to each their own. Some people might swear by rebound sex, and others might condemn it.<br>\nI condemn it. And not because I think casual sex is wrong. If that’s your thing, you do you. I simply feel the disadvantages of engaging in rebound sex will drastically outweigh the advantages.</p>\n<p>Rebound sex is, well, awkward. I don’t understand the appeal of having a drunken night of trying to figure out how to please a complete stranger. You just came out of a long-term relationship, where your partner knew exactly how to please you and you knew exactly how to please them. Now you’re like, “Is this guy into biting? My ex was into biting.” And that guy is like, “This chick really needs to stop biting me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And then there’s the awkward post-sex moment of thinking how unsatisfying that experience was. And then — of course — you start missing your ex. And instead of feeling empowered by going out and sleeping with someone else, you end up feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>Why is this a good idea again?</p>\n<p>Not only does the whole experience seem blatantly un-enjoyable, but it can even be detrimental. Being close and intimate with someone won’t necessarily distract you from your ex. In fact, it could just end up reminding you of your ex, because you were intimate with your ex for such a long time. You’ll compare these kisses to your ex’s kisses. You’ll compare this body to your ex’s body. How could you not?</p>\n<p>And, generally, if you still have feelings for your ex, then your ex is going to win this mini competition in your head. Instead of thinking that this new sex partner is great, you’ll be lying in bed wondering if anyone will ever have abs that are as great as your ex’s were. So, instead of distracting yourself (which was your game plan in the beginning) you are inadvertently making your head explode with thoughts about how great your past love was.</p>\n<p>Motivations for rebound sex are also generally not thought through very well. Are you seeking rebound sex for revenge? Why exactly should your ex care if you sleep with someone new? If they dumped you, they probably anticipated you would have sex with someone else eventually. And anyway, it will be obvious to your ex that this “great sex” you had was actually nothing but a dig at them. It’s not an indication that you’ve moved on, it’s an indication that you are not handling the breakup well.</p>\n<p>And if you’re trying to make your ex jealous, having rebound sex isn’t the way to do either. That will most likely just make your ex angry with you or end up hurting them, and that will not make them want you back — trust me. Hearing that my ex has turned into a man-slut will not make me desire him more. And if they aren’t angry or hurt, then they’ve probably moved on and your sexcapades are pointless.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m not saying that if you’ve had rebound sex that you’re an idiot. On the contrary, very intelligent and rational people do it all the time and maybe it actually does help some. The broken-hearted will search out all avenues. I’m just pointing out the bad side and some of it’s flawed logic. If you’re just sleeping with someone to get back at an ex, it will probably not make you feel much better. And if you’re doing it to forget an ex, then that probably won’t work out too well either. I think people should be warned.</p>\n<p>Instead of focusing all your energy on having meaningless sex with someone random, maybe you should focus your energy on a new hobby or building a new friendship. Surround yourself with good people, keep distracted with projects you enjoy and try to be happy alone. Eventually, the urge to rebound will fade, and you’ll find that sexy someone who you want to start a new relationship with. And, best of all, they will be able to give you a much more enjoyable and less awkward sexual experience.</p>\n<p><em>Brenna Dilger says getting it up quickly is not always best.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

I know we all wince when we read that, but with the hardcore ragefest that will soon be occurring in the name of Halloween, it’s especially important to be cautious and aware. And we should note that just because Halloween is the allotted time of the year where girls can dress “slutty” without judgment from other girls, it does not mean that they are slutty. It’s a costume. And anyways, if you’re slut-shaming girls in the first place, you need to check yourself.</p>\n<p>Ladies, many of you take liberties with your drinking and partying because you assume that rape is a rarity. Allow me to startle you into awareness. Recently, I was sitting at Gio’s, drinking a pitcher with a few of my friends, when the topic of rape came up. It was then that I learned all three of the girls I was sitting with had been raped. I was appalled, to say the least. And this was not, “Oh, we hooked up and I was a little tipsy,” rape. All three of them had blacked out at a party or were amongst friends, and things had taken a turn for the worse, sometimes at the hands of aforementioned “friends.”</p>\n<p>Now, if a man rapes, he is at fault. Horrible, horrible things should happen to him and his genitals (I’ll get back to you in a minute, guys). But ladies, it’s up to you to be aware of yourself and your surroundings. Don’t be that girl who blacks out regularly or hooks up when she’s too drunk. Take care of yourself and don’t put yourself in dangerous circumstances if you can help it. Or, if you just feel a little off or uncomfortable, don’t take risks and walk home with strange men.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dudes, obviously consent is sexy. Everyone can agree on that. But I acknowledge that sometimes it is difficult to properly assess whether or not consent is given. Especially if you and your potential partner have had a few drinks; the lines blur. Therefore, I have included the guidelines below for you to use so that you are always certain of yourself and your actions:</p>\n<p>1. Check in with her. Asking a girl straight-out if she wants to have sex is perhaps a little awkward. What I feel works really well is implementing friendly check-ins. “Are you comfortable with that?” is probably the best, followed by, “Does this feel all right?” or, “Do you want me to stop?” The latter should be used especially if you can sense her discomfort. If she is uncomfortable and you can tell, please remember the joys of cuddling. If anyone is uncomfortable, there should be NO nookie. And let me be sure to emphasize, there is a difference between being anxious and excited vs. being uncomfortable. More often that not, your check-ins will be unnecessary but they’ll be touched by your consideration and you won’t get your ass sued.</p>\n<p>2. The minute a girl says “no,” fucking STOP and don’t be an asshole. I’ve explicitly said to guys at parties, “I’ll come home with you, but no sex. If that’s not cool with you, keep looking,” to which they reply, “Oh no, of course.” Upon arriving at their house, they seem to forget my previous rule-setting. God, that’s so annoying. If a girl says no, don’t try to convince her otherwise. Don’t present her with all of the pros of dabbling in your dick and don’t sulk. Seriously, can you see yourself when you sulk and how incredibly unattractive it is? You’re being a petulant ass; appreciate that your partner has boundaries and cuddle up.</p>\n<p>3. If she is too drunk, don’t do it. On top of the whole, “Hey, I’m taking advantage of another human being,” thing, is it really worth it? I mean, she could pee in your bed or throw up. Is it really so hard to find a sober and willing hook up? If this is the kind of behavior you’re going to resort to, you need to assess your quality of character.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to write this because I really don’t see why I have to say these things. It should all go without saying. However, one thing I do want to convey to you is that you have options for when something like this does happen. Ladies, the thing my friends all agreed upon was that they wish they had reported the crime. Some didn’t do it because they had mutual friends with their rapist. Others didn’t because they felt ashamed. Please know that you have easily accessible options and even if you don’t want to report it immediately, you should still take the proper steps.</p>\n<p>If you go to the Rape Crisis Center downtown, you can file a report and have the tests done within 3-5 days of the incident. Afterwards, they will send the file to the police department. Here is the beauty of it: You don’t have to follow through on the case until you want to. You have a whole year where your incident will be on file before they throw it out. If you decide within that time that you want to press charges, you can do so. So even if it happens and you don’t feel like you’re ever going to report it, go anyways. There is no harm in doing so and they’ll be able to offer you the proper counseling services. Also, remember that by reporting a rape, you may be preventing another one.</p>\n<p>So, beloved peers, please be safe and in control of yourself this Halloween.
