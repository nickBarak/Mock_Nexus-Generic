We want you to pay a lot of attention to the exciting parts.</strong></p>\n<p>Women are capable of having more than one orgasm in a short amount of time, and we are more than willing to prove this to you. Don’t save the big moment for sex, that’s just the finale. Especially after we’ve gone down on you and you’ve made the mistake of either bouncing our heads like a basketball or trying to read Morse code on our scalps, it wouldn’t be such a bad idea for you to return the favor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. We want you to respect us.</strong></p>\n<p>We know that we’re not the only girl that you’ve done these things with, but we want to feel like we are. We want to feel like both of us are genuinely enjoying ourselves and not just trying to get off.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. We want you to let us be a whore in the bedroom.</strong></p>\n<p>Shit, we want to be a lady on your arm, sure, but we want to be a closet whore, too. We want to see your skills and prove we have a few tricks up our sleeves too. We don’t want to just be a notch on your bedpost — we want to be a fucking accomplishment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. We want you to be sweet and sensitive.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to care about us. We want you to go slow and make sure we’re getting what we want. We want to feel every sensation, not just to be jack-hammered to death.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. We want you to be aggressive and rough.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to make us go insane to the point where, if the sheets are still on the bed afterwards, it wasn’t even worth remembering. We want to see how loudly our bed creaks and we want our neighbors to call their landlords and ask for soundproof walls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. We want you to talk to us.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to compliment us. We want you to say something cute. We want you to make us laugh.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. We want you to shut the fuck up.</strong></p>\n<p>We don’t want you to say that one thing that you think will be really hot and sexy in the moment that actually isn’t. Don’t ruin the mood by giving us a play-by-play of what’s going on either — we’re getting a firsthand experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9. We want you to tease us.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to play a little hard-to-get. We want to get to the point where we have to have you. We want to get as close to the edge as we can and then have to start again from somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10. We want you to have sex with us. Right. Now.</strong></p>\n<p>Hey, now, don’t tease us too much. At some point we want you to cut the bullshit and make it happen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yeah, okay, I contradicted myself a couple times. It’s not that we don’t know what we want, we just kind of, well … want it all. It depends on the day, I guess. Is that too much to ask?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>To see the “He Said” portion of this feature, <a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42469\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42469\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed-2/","id":3508,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3507,3506,3505],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[1843,3129,3259,3502,3503,3504,3507,3508,3509,3518,3526,3536,3579,3646,4290,7849],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Top 10 Misconceptions About Sex","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What we think and what’s true, based on information from UCSB professor John Baldwin, sexuality specialist, and http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo, the website created by Baldwin and his wife as a comp...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>What we think and what’s true, based on information from UCSB professor John Baldwin, sexuality specialist, and http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo, the website created by Baldwin and his wife as a comprehensive source of sex education.</em></p>\n<p><strong>1.

There is a high risk of pregnancy, since a man may unknowingly release sperm inside the vagina before his orgasm. Sperm can also find their way into the vagina from outside the opening if the male is slow to pull out and starts to ejaculate before he has completely removed his penis from the vaginal area. However, recent studies show that this actually works better than perceived. If you absolutely NEED to have sex, it’s better than nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Women want multiple orgasms</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of women just want ONE orgasm. Multiple orgasms don’t usually occur in the 20-24 age group. It takes time to understand a woman’s body and what it wants on both partners’ account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Gay guys only have anal sex</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, the most common type of sex homosexual males have is oral. But as for anal sex, they are considerably more cautious about the dangers of the behavior than heterosexuals: They are more likely to use condoms for STD protection, whereas heterosexuals generally only think of condoms as birth control for penile-vaginal sex.</p>\n<p><strong>5. I should hide my “bad” body parts</strong></p>\n<p>That should be the last thing you worry about. It’s a shame to handicap yourself by refusing to go on top because you think your stomach bulges. This country places so much emphasis on body image, but personality should be more important than looks. The hottest person in the party might be your ideal, but if they open their mouth and they’re an idiot or a jerk, why would you want to sleep with them anyway? You should ENJOY the experience, not just look good doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The Morning After Pill is the only contraceptive I need</strong></p>\n<p>Emergency contraceptives are not nearly as good as using birth control all the time. That being said, it is a good thing to have in your medicine chest — it takes anxiety, stress and fear out of your mind. What if you get into a situation where you do need an emergency contraceptive? Condom breaks? Miss a pill? It is a good thing to turn to right away. The FDA recently approved a new emergency contraceptive: ella. It has full effectiveness over the course of five days (in which sperm inhabit women’s bodies) but is only available by prescription. Visit ella-kwikmed.com for an online medical consultation and prescription.</p>\n<p><strong>7. I can’t get pregnant if I have sex on my period</strong></p>\n<p>It IS possible to get pregnant while on your period. You are most likely to become pregnant during ovulation, which generally occurs 14 days after the start of your last period — but this time is variable. Sperm can live in a woman’s body for five days; if it is still present during ovulation, you CAN get pregnant.</p>\n<p><strong>8. My sexual fantasies reflect my sexual orientation</strong></p>\n<p>Homosexuals have heterosexual fantasies and heterosexuals have homosexual fantasies. Don’t take these too seriously; they don’t reveal anything about your sexual orientation. Likewise, these fantasies aren’t usually the most common — your dreams and fantasies are based on crazy associations and random thoughts — they bounce all over the place.</p>\n<p><strong>9. The tighter the condom, the better</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to condoms, knowledge and skill are more important than anything else. You should always properly put on a condom and take precautions to hold onto it while pulling it out. Females, you should learn how to put it on him in a way that excites him — he won’t be able to say no. If he’s not going to do it the way you want, you can always say no.</p>\n<p><strong>10. I can learn everything about sex from porn</strong></p>\n<p>Soc152A is made up of 2/3 women and 1/3 men. Some guys think they don’t need to know anything other than what they’ve seen in porn. However, it offers an unrealistic presentation of sex. Girls can actually tell when a guy has only learned from porn … and it’s usually not a good thing. There is actually a large repertoire of skills men can acquire that would significantly increase sexual pleasure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Amanda Hill is the</em> Daily Nexus <em>Managing

Daily Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-13/uc-study-abroad-suspends-spring-hong-kong-program-citing-safety-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Wednesday that the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) was cancelling its spring study abroad programs amidst concerns for student safety and was considering evacuating its 79 Fall 2019 study abroad students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, however, the program decided to leave the decision to leave Hong Kong up to the students themselves.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP spokesperson Myla Edmond said the program sent an email to students last Friday “strongly urging them to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible,” adding that UCEAP was uncertain if local transportation and the airport would be affected — another cause of concern. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edmond declined to specify the number of students who were leaving and the number who were staying, citing privacy concerns, but said that UCEAP had heard from all of the students who were abroad and confirmed that many of them would be leaving Hong Kong in the coming days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only a few who had family in the area would be staying, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP will be covering all the costs of changing travel plans, Edmond said. However, one of the biggest pieces of information is still up in the air: whether or not students will receive their course credits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We definitely don’t want them to lose an entire term due to issues that have nothing to do with them; it’s beyond their control,” Edmond said. “Some of them will be taking online courses, so we’re still trying to work out the details for that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that each student’s academics would be dealt with by the universities they were attending in Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several universities </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/business/hong-kong-protests-recession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut their semesters short last week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> without coordinating with students and instructors about completing courses for the term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anita Carraher, a third-year environmental studies major who was studying abroad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong this semester, said in an interview with the Nexus on Sunday that she was still waiting to hear from several professors about how she would be able to finish her courses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Hong Kong University announced that they would be having online classes, and most other universities have also announced some type of either online form of classes or have also just cancelled classes, but specifically with Chinese University [of Hong Kong], they cancelled classes before they decided how they were going to finish up the semester,” Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 11, the Chinese University of Hong Kong cancelled classes for the day; later that night, they also cancelled classes for Tuesday, and on Tuesday, classes were cancelled for Wednesday, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Wednesday, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ns3WNd1rmpfZ_NDQBZQI4oY-yHNZkQC9rWNLSD_2JqDKVaRf8RZeXIZw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amidst violence at the edge of campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that the university cancelled classes for the entire term.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Chinese University of Hong Kong — where the university is made up of several different independent colleges — it has been more difficult to coordinate course completions, especially since each college has its own protocols, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students on campus were evacuated from their dorms, while others like Carraher were not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carraher is currently staying with family in Hong Kong but said that she has heard from other students that coordinating housing during the time period has been difficult, particularly for students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where students were not allowed to return to campus due to high concentrations of tear gas chemicals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the university had been working with students to arrange off-campus housing for students up to Wednesday, after which they were expected to leave Hong Kong or secure their own housing, Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carraher, whose stay with family was initially meant to be temporary, had left all her belongings on campus. As of Sunday, she was waiting to hear whether she could return to campus to retrieve her luggage. On Wednesday, she said she would be traveling around Asia for a few weeks and would try to return to campus later in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before she arrived in Hong Kong, Carraher said there had been talk about whether or not the exchange program would be cancelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s] a really different look now, comparing those protests [over the summer] to what’s happening now. It’s definitely gotten more and more extreme, especially when it [has] come to police treatment, of not just students, but to me, I thought the most alarming thing most of the time was police treatment of press,” Carraher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although students studying abroad in Hong Kong received messages from friends back home asking about their safety, Carraher and two other UCSB students in Hong Kong, Rita Lake and Emma Xing, maintained that as long as they stayed informed about where protests were occurring, they weren’t particularly in danger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Besides the transportation thing, the protests haven’t really affected us that much because exchange students mainly don’t really protest or get involved in any of this, and as long as you don’t get involved, you’re not really in any sort of danger,” Xing said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lake, a fourth-year political science and art history double major, and Xing, a third-year history and philosophy double major, were studying at Hong Kong University when the roads to campus were blocked by protestors. Once classes were suspended and UCEAP emailed them recommending they leave Hong Kong, Lake and Xing went to China to stay with Xing’s grandparents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two are currently completing classes online, and Lake noted that her professors have been “really accommodating,” particularly since many of her courses had relied on group projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they finish up their coursework, Lake and Xing plan to spend the rest of their semester in China before their previously scheduled trip to Thailand in mid-December, after which they’ll be returning to the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of my friends have been asking me, ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Stay safe,’ and I guess I just wanted to say that I was never really in danger in the first place,” Xing said. “I think we’re really privileged to be able to leave the situation, because obviously if you’re a Hong Kong student, if you’re a Hong Kong resident, you can’t leave the situation because that’s your home.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do feel very privileged to be able to leave.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11/29]: The story has been updated to remove references to Hong Kong as a country; <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/topics/reference/hong-kong-history-explain-relationship-china/?fbclid=IwAR2ofMqoKoDbZjgl4Cr7feqazjNSX9bjrDDoX3KqQDrnhRSJjkj2ONQdmRY\">while it operates</a> as its own country, it is technically a territory of China.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Half the fun of having sex is getting to see each other undress.</strong></p>\n<p>No guy wants to see you in what looks like your grandmother’s hand-me-downs, so take the time to visit Victoria’s Secret and pick out some sexy lingerie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. Your body is a temple, so put in the time and effort to take care of it.</strong></p>\n<p>Exercising and eating healthy are a major part of my life, so it’s important for a woman to feel the same way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. Vaginas are the unofficial eighth natural wonder of the world.</strong></p>\n<p>There is so much going on down there and until someone creates a universal manual for guys like me, we’re going to need your help figuring out what you like and where you like it. Spend some time getting to know your body. If you don’t know what makes you tick, how can we?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9. Make your time with him special.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not saying you have to pretend like your drunken encounter at some party Friday night on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive is anything more than a one night stand, but I’m likely to lose interest if I think you’re just as content winding up in my bed as any other guy’s room in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10. Nothing’s more of a turn on than when, in the middle of foreplay, a woman stops and whispers in your ear, “I’m going to fuck you so good.”</strong></p>\n<p>However, it really ruins the effect when it turns out they know less about the art of sex than my 11-year-old brother. Be honest with your partner: If you don’t know your way around his joystick, let him know.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/","id":3507,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3506,3505,3504],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
