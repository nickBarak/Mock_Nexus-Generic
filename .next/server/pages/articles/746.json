With injuries plaguing the Gauchos thus far into the season, they look forward to hopefully having a healthy squad for the first time in weeks in Saturday’s game against San Jose.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Winning conference matches is important for us, but we need to remain just as focused this weekend,” junior April Scatliffe said. “We need to treat every match like it’s a conference match so we will be ready for the Big West tournament in April. We’ve been working on our doubles play and our consistency in our singles play. We’ve been working on being aggressive when the opportunities present themselves.”</p>\n<p>The Spartans find themselves on a two-game winning streak, but previously fell into a horrific losing streak of seven games. In their last two matches however, they have beaten difficult opponents in Cal Poly and Pacific.</p>\n<p>In its last match, San Jose State uprooted Pacific in a commanding 5-2 victory. UCSB lost to Pacific in a tough decision on Feb. 16 by a 6-1 margin.</p>\n<p>Starting at first doubles for the Spartans is freshman Marie Klocker who has had an impressive first year. In Klocker’s match against Cal Poly, she displayed a superb sequence of endurance defeating her opponent 7-6, 3-6, 6-0. A very impressive stat comes from Spartan senior Sabastian Leon Chao who won her 119th match against Cal Poly; with that victory Chao boosted herself to second place all-time on the Spartan’s career win list.</p>\n<p>This is without a doubt a strong and imposing Spartan team; UCSB will have to arrive riding the taste of victory it received from its impressive win at Fullerton. The Gauchos have been in a season-long pursuit for improved mental strength and physical stamina. If Santa Barbara can harvest these two components, then it has a good chance of gaining the advantage over San Jose St. this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The biggest challenge will be dealing with various injuries, which can lead to some confidence issues,” Scatliffe said. “Everyone is doing their best to stay or get healthy and compete as hard as possible no matter what obstacles we face.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are set to take the courts this Saturday at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54230\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54230\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/","id":746,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[745,744,743],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete","biography":"Not available","articles":[171,175,178,189,192,194,196,208,209,210,211,217,219,305,658,659,662,728,746,749,785,786,1774,1806],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Advance to Second Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mens-bball-vs-Pacific_Kenneth-Song_Big-West-Tourney_3.8.2012-7750.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mens-bball-vs-Pacific_Kenneth-Song_Big-West-Tourney_3.8.2012-7750.jpg?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team hosted a party for three on Thursday afternoon at the Honda Center.

Sophomore guard Kyle Boswell and sophomore forward Keegan Hornbuckle each went 3-of-3 from the field in the first half, combining for 17 of the Gauchos’ 43 points through the opening 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“I thought Boswell and Keegan were the difference for us in the first half,” Williams said. “Boswell with shooting, Keegan just all around play – they played exceptionally well.”</p>\n<p>The offensive support from the Gaucho bench was a welcome replacement for the void left by senior guard Orlando Johnson’s two-point effort in the first half. Johnson, who was recently named to the All-Big West Conference first team, shot just 1-for-3 through the first 20 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The long-range shooting of Boswell, combined with two three-pointers from senior guard James Nunnally, shocked the Pacific defense out of its zone coverage and into a man-to-man set entering the second period.</p>\n<p>“Guys came in hitting shots [in the first half] and it got them out of the zone,” Johnson said. “They came out man-to-man and I felt more comfortable.”</p>\n<p>Johnson awoke to the man-to-man pressure at the start of the second half by scoring 12 of Santa Barbara’s first 15 points, highlighted by a stadium-rattling windmill jam on a solo fast break.</p>\n<p>“It comes natural to me,” Johnson joked about the dunk. “That was just one of those times where I was feeling pretty good.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on runs of 8-0 and 16-6 during the second period, effectively smothering any comeback opportunities for Pacific.</p>\n<p>If UCSB is able to overcome the Mustangs, they will advance to Saturday night’s Big West Tournament championship game at 7 p.m. Tip-off for tonight’s game is set for 9 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-irvine/","id":743,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[742,741,740],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Women Complete Storybook Ending With Win Over Long Beach State in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince — a Big West Championship and an automatic berth into the Big Dance.

At the end of the day, this is why you play the game–for March Madness and a chance to cut down nets.”</p>\n<p>It was a tough regular season for the Gauchos indeed. After winning the Big West a season ago, UC Santa Barbara experienced a lot of change, beginning with a new Head Coach. For a while, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>The team was not going to give up though and all season long, Mitchell reiterated that her team would peak when it mattered most in March and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors could leave. The Gauchos won nine of their last 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special. All the hard times that we went through this year…I wouldn’t trade it for this moment right now.”</p>\n<p>And as the title game came to a close, it was evident in the team the obstacles they had faced and overcame. With under a minute left, Johnson exited from her final Big West game with tears of joy and as that final buzzer sounded, the team flooded the court. Johnson, along with senior forward Kelsey Adrian, was embraced in celebration. The team couldn’t get those championship t-shirt on quicker.</p>\n<p>“To the world, we’ve probably done the impossible, but to me it’s everything I expected when I took this job,” Mitchell said. “Like I told them, it would’ve been easy for them to jump ship with a new coach and a change in philosophy, but at the end of the day, the seniors led the way. They wanted to leave their legacy, which was a Big West Championship, so I only have to thank them for believing in me.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>After taking a nine point lead to begin the second half, Long Beach took a timeout and the 49’ers responded. Freshman guard Alex Sanchez sparked a 13-3 run and the Beach took its first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s leading three point shooter, Adrian, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead, a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period. That would be enough to give UCSB its 14th title, the most in Big West history.</p>\n<p>“I have to thank Coach Stringer for preparing me for this opportunity, but I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship game, the Gauchos put a complete game together. They defeated Pacific 84-66 and got revenge on the team that knocked them out in the first round the year before.</p>\n<p>“We came in with a chip on our shoulder, knowing how horrible it felt last year to top the conference and lose to one of the last seeds on your home floor,” Nesbit said. “So when we came out here, we knew we had to play a solid forty minutes to get the win.”</p>\n<p>While known for playing in low scoring games, it was impossible to guess that the Gauchos were dead last in scoring. The 84 points is a season high for UCSB and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit, finished with 23 and 20 points, respectively. Both are career highs for the sophomore guards. Johnson also finished with 20 points, hitting 10-12 at the free throw line to clinch the game.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling a bit during season and this is the time to turn it on,” Zornig said. “I wanted to come in, step up, and do whatever I can to help this team win.”</p>\n<p>After taking a 37-28 lead into halftime, UOP immediately closed the gap to four to begin the second half. However, UCSB pulled away, tallying 47 second half points.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program.

For much of this season, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>Mitchell reiterated all season long that her team would peak when it mattered most in March, and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors, could leave.</p>\n<p>The squad responded over the past few weeks, winning nine of its final 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards, eight on the offensive end. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field through the opening 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>After taking a quick nine-point lead in the second half, Long Beach responded with a 13-3 run and the 49’ers took their first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>Adrian, UCSB’s leading three-point shooter, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead that they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period.</p>\n<p>“I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship, the Gauchos had to first overcome a University of Pacific squad that had beaten them during both of the teams’ regular season meetings. UCSB’s 84 points against UOP was a season high, and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit finished with career highs of 23 and 20 points apiece, while Johnson tallied 20 of her own on 10-12 shooting from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program. We’re jumping on their backs and seeing how far they can take us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB now faces Baylor in first round action of the NCAA women’s basketball tournament next Sunday, March 18.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/","id":745,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[744,743,742],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
