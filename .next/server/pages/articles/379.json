CSUF currently owns an overall record of 2-13, 0-1 after a loss to Long Beach State in its conference opener. The tale is similar for CSUN who is also 2-13, 0-1 after a conferencing opening loss to UC Davis.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the Big West schedule beginning last week, the transition into conference play offers an opportunity for teams that may have struggled during non-conference play to uplift their seasons. All below the .500 mark, it is assured that each team has its sight set on a possible ‘Cinderella’ story to close out the season.</p>\n<p>“We don’t value who they [CSUF &amp; CSUN] are based off their win-loss record,” Henrickson said. “Especially, look at Fullerton, they beat LMU, were in a six-point game with Pepperdine and went into overtime with Wyoming. I would hope we are mature enough to recognize that a record isn’t indicative [of our season].</p>\n<p>Certainly, a team’s overall record isn’t always indicative of its performance on the court. UCSB proved this last season, earning its first win of the season against the Titans after a 0-24, 0-11 start. Still in the process of developing into a team that can collectively play a full four quarters, Santa Barbra’s matchups this week will simply come down to more than just who can score and defend.</p>\n<p>It will come down to the miscellaneous fundamentals of the game. Particularly, the Gauchos’ ability to protect the ball and not turn it over. Overall, UCSB averages 21.9 turnovers per game, but have turned it over by an average of 26 times per game since the start of conference play. In six consecutive games, it has recorded 20 or more turnovers. The blame for the Gauchos’ miscues can only be placed upon themselves as they have constantly committed traveling violations.</p>\n<p>“We just made really bad decisions and now we’ve thrown traveling into it,” Henrickson said. “They’re your feet, control your feet. But, that’s discipline and focus on attention to detail.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB is not the only team affected by the error of turnovers as Fullerton finished with a season-high 27 turnovers in its conference opener.</p>\n<p>The loss of four senior players, three of which were starters, leaves CSUF with a young team of primarily underclassmen. A total of five freshmen are listed on the Titans’ roster while it has just one redshirt senior.</p>\n<p>While the loss of All-Big West First Teamer guard Chante Miles, who averaged 19.4 points per game, the emergence of freshman combo guard/forward Michelle Berry gives Fullerton something to rejoice about now and for the future.</p>\n<p>She made an emphatic start to her collegiate career with a 38-point performance in the Titans’ season opening victory versus Portland State. It was a monumental outing as Berry’s point total serves as the most by a freshman in program history, prompting her to become the first freshman to earn Big West Athlete of the Week honors as well.</p>\n<p>Complementing Berry’s scoring efforts is the Titan’s three-point shooting ability. On average, Fullerton attempts a total of 22.3 shots from deep, producing its 30.4 three-point percentage. It currently leads the Big West in total threes made with 102. Despite LBSU setting a Big West single-game record against them with 20 three-point field goals, the Titans nearly matched the 49ers feat with a season-high 13 three-point makes of their own.</p>\n<p>The sharpshooting of freshman guard Dani Craig from beyond the arc is a pivotal asset to Fullerton’s success from the perimeter. She ranks second in the Big West in total three-pointers made with 35 and is fifth in three-point percentage at 36.8.</p>\n<p>On average, Santa Barbara holds opponents to 30.5 percent shooting from behind the three-point line. With the Gauchos being undersized in the paint, opponents usually base their offensive game in the paint. Certainly, Fullerton will take three-point shot attempts, but it will be interesting to see how much the Titans feed the post.</p>\n<p>Continuing UCSB’s pair of road games is its matchup at Cal State Northridge on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ resurgence over the last two years has been outstanding as the reigning Big West champions have won the conference tournament for the last two consecutive years, winning its first regular season title in program history in the 2013-14 season.</p>\n<p>After setting a program record with 23 wins last season (23-11, 11-5), CSUN’s sudden decline has been a shock to many. Yet, its current 2-13, 0-1 record is justified by its loss of five seniors, four of which were in its starting lineup just last season. The replacement of the 2013 Big West Player of the Year and All-Big West First Teamer guard Ashlee Guay along with All-Big West Honorable Mentions Cinnamon Lister and Janae Sharpe has been difficult.</p>\n<p>Yet, the upside of sophomore forward Tessa Boagni has been a spark within the Matadors’ slow start to the season. An All-Big West Freshman Team selection last year, Boagni leads CSUN in scoring with 12.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>While Boagni has embraced a bigger role on offense, the team as a collective unit has played poorly on defense. CSUN has been outscored by opponents by a point differential of 19.9 ppg this season while allowing 79.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>Prior to its loss to UC Riverside last Saturday, UCSB had been averaging 86.6 ppg during its three-game winning streak. In spite of a great start to their last game, the Gauchos must remain committed to their style of play on offense and not allow the tempo of their opponent decide their playing style.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s matchup against Cal State Fullerton will begin at 7 p.m. in Titan Gym. It will face Cal State Northridge on Sunday at 4 p.m. in the Matadome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gauchos-prepare-for-first-road-trip-of-conference-schedule-face-csuf-and-csun/","id":379,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[378,377,376],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos End Eight Game Losing Skid with 89-41 Victory over La Verne","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Basketball-v-Santa-Clara-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-0870.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Basketball-v-Santa-Clara-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-0870.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team's total of 89 points in its win over La Verne on Sunday was its most in five years.

La Verne is now on a three-game losing streak, landing the Leopards with a 2-5 record.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, Santa Barbara outscored its opponent in each quarter of a game. The first quarter of Sunday’s game resulted in UCSB outscoring La Verne 18-8. It was the first start of the season for senior forward Kendra Morrison, who scored UCSB’s first two field goals of the game to ignite its 12-2 run.</p>\n<p>The emergence of Miller, sophomore guard Makala Roper and senior guard Jasmine Ware helped UCSB build upon its lead in the second quarter. Miller and Roper provided two three-pointers each with Miller scoring eight and Roper six in the quarter while Ware scored eight points off the bench. Both Miller and Ware registered career-highs in assists as Miller finished with five and Ware had six, respectively.</p>\n<p>A make from beyond the arc by junior guard Faye Osburn brought La Verne within 10 points of the Gauchos’ lead of 27-17, causing a UCSB timeout. However, the scoring combination of Miller and Ware helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 43-22 at halftime as the two scored the team’s last 12 points to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>Providing balance to the Gauchos’ tremendous offense was their stingy defense which held the Leopards to a 23.7 field goal percentage and 16.7 three-point percentage. UCSB held La Verne to just eight points in the paint. Sophomore forward Taylor Farris played a key role in the Gauchos’ denial of points down low. She tied her career-high of four blocks and recorded a career and game-high of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>It was a similar tale in the second half as the Gauchos opened the third quarter with a 6-0 run. Despite senior guard Shannon Irwin and junior forward Noelle Cobb scoring 13 points each, La Verne was unable to contain UCSB’s offensive attack. In addition to its control of the paint, Santa Barbara’s second unit was seemingly unstoppable outscoring the Leopards 42-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB outscored La Verne 47-19 in the second half. As the fourth quarter ended, the Gauchos’ largest lead of 51 points helped them to cruise to their 89-41 victory.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game was the first of four-straight home games for UCSB. Santa Barbara will host Morehead State next Monday, Dec. 28<sup>th</sup> at 7:00 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67012\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67012\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/","id":376,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[375,374,373],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Winning Streak Comes to End in Conference Opener at Hawai’i","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team fell to Hawai'i 65-57 in its conference opening game this past Saturday, ending a four-game win streak.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67275\" style=\"width: 207px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67275\" data-attachment-id=\"67275\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/mbball_vsohio-20151121-dustinharris-4-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"DaJuan Smith looks for an opening through the defense.

The Rainbow Warriors meanwhile improved to an impressive 13-2 overall and 2-0 start in Big West play, extending their current winning streak to five. They are 9-1 in through their last 10 outings.</p>\n<p>Both teams struggled with their shooting out of the gates, matching each other at 33.3 percent from the field in the first half. Although the Gauchos took a slim 28-27 lead into halftime behind 10 first half points from senior guard Michael Bryson, UCSB could not find a way to sustain a lead the rest of the way.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sophomore guard Gabe Vincent knocked down his third three-pointer of the half and career-high fifth of the night with 3:57 remaining to bring Santa Barbara within a point at 58-57, but the Rainbow Warriors went on a 7-0 run to close out the game, including 5-6 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>A huge lay-up to beat the shot clock by junior center Stefan Jankovic with under a minute remaining put Hawai’i up 61-57, and the Gauchos were unable to answer in their final possessions, falling 65-57.</p>\n<p>Hawai’is Isaac Fleming led all players with 22 points, matching Vincent by hitting 3-5 from deep in the second half. For the game, the sophomore guard went 7-13 from the field and 5-5 from the free throw line. Jankovic was solid the entire night, putting up 19 points on an efficient 9-14 from the field to go along with nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite playing every minute of the game, Hawai’i senior guard Roderick Bobbitt had a rough shooting night, making just 1-10 shots, but still managed a decent output with six points, seven boards and four assists.</p>\n<p>The free throw disparity in the second half favored Hawai’i 13-2 in attempts and played a big part in the UCSB loss as it has all season. At the start of conference play, the Gauchos ranked last in attempts by a wide margin at just 199 through 15 games, while Hawaii had already surpassed 330 attempts.</p>\n<p>While the offense struggled as a group, Bryson and Vincent were able to keep UCSB in it until late. Bryson finished with his second consecutive double-double and fourth of his career with 16 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Vincent, whose only made field goals came from behind the arc, continued his hot shooting of late as he made 5-9 from three on his way to 17 points. He has now made 15 of his last 31 three-point attempts (48.4 percent) over the last five games.</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded its opponent 39-37 for the night but shot itself in the foot with turnovers. The Gauchos turned the ball over 19 times compared to just 12 by the Rainbow Warriors, who outscored UCSB 23-10 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be back in action this Thursday when they face Blue-Green rival Cal Poly on the road before coming back to face UC Irvine this Saturday at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/","id":377,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[376,375,374],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Poor Shooting Sees UCSB Drop Home Season-Opener to Oregon St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos finished just 33.8 percent from the field and 18.2 percent from three on their way to a loss to Oregon St. on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66717\" style=\"width: 226px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"229635873\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66737\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66717\" data-attachment-id=\"66717\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/gabe-vincent-tries-to-work-his-way-past-the-defense-dustin-harrsdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-14-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Gabe Vincent tries to work his way past the defense.

The Gauchos shot just 8-30 (26.7 percent) from the field and 1-12 (8.3 percent) in the second half on their way to a 71-59 loss.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara falls to 1-2 in the young season while the Beavers went undefeated on their two-game weekend road trip to improve to a perfect 4-0 start for just the second time since 2000.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Gary Payton II filled up the box score once again for his team with a game-high 21 points on 8-13 from the field and 3-4 from three-point range. The reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year also finished with seven boards, four assists and two steals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With a steal in each of his last 35 games, Payton II is just two short of the school record his father set from 1989-1990.</p>\n<p>An 8-2 run out of the gates by Oregon St. didn’t bode well for the Gauchos, who have had relatively slow starts in each of their first three games. UCSB answered with a 7-0 run, taking the lead after a pair of free throws by senior guard Michael Bryson, but the home side was only able to hold on to a 9-8 advantage for 12 seconds for its only lead of the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kept it close before a three-pointer by freshman guard Stephen Thompson Jr. gave the Beavers a 43-35 lead heading into halftime. Oregon St. shot lights out in the first half, going 8-10 on three-pointers through 20 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Going back to the final minutes of the first half, Oregon St. went on a 15-2 run to help put the game away.</p>\n<p>From there, UCSB was unable to find much of a flow on offense, finishing the night shooting 33.8 percent from the field and an ugly 18.2 percent from three.</p>\n<p>It was another disappointing game for sophomore Gabe Vincent, who finished with just three points on 1-8 shooting. Bryson and senior forward John Green finished with similar numbers, both shooting just above 30 percent to score 14 and 16 points, respectively, to lead the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Sam Beeler was one of the few bright spots for UCSB, recording his first career double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 39-37 rebounding advantage and turned the ball over just nine times compared to the Beavers’ 13, but shooting proved to be the difference. As a team, Santa Barbara has a field goal percentage of just 36.2 so far this season and are a miserable 23.4 percent from deep.</p>\n<p>Missing the efficiency of their focal point from the previous three seasons in Alan Williams, the team’s remaining big playmakers will need to step up their game moving forward for UCSB to have more success. Reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent is hitting just 25.8 percent of his shots playing alongside fellow guard junior Eric Childress, who is also shooting just 31.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a mid-week road game at San Francisco state this Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66737\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66737\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/poor-shooting-sees-ucsb-drop-home-season-opener-to-oregon-st/","id":378,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[377,376,375],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
