Self-Governance Bill AB 3 was written by Assemblyman Das Williams and proposes to make I.V. a community services district (CSD), which would allow I.V. to levy taxes in order to provide services such as additional lighting, parking, community maintenance and advocacy through elected board members. LAFCO has drafted a letter of concern over the bill, requiring it to pass through their jurisdiction before progressing into the state legislature.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the initial opposition to the bill stemmed from LAFCO members’ concern over not being involved and informed about the process.</p>\n<p>“I think that LAFCO members are concerned because normally when we talk about making a community services district, it would go through LAFCO, not the state legislature,” Farr said. “That’s why a special meeting has been called to decide whether to send a letter or not.”</p>\n<p>Farr said sending the bill to state legislature does not necessarily exclude LAFCO from being involved with the creation of a CSD and that after the bill is drafted in its entirety there will be a chance to determine whether LAFCO will approve it or not.</p>\n<p>“Because we don’t know what the final bill language is, it’s entirely possible LAFCO will be involved,” Farr said. “Actually when the legislature passed a similar bill to create a college district for Isla Vista 30–40 years ago, they did part of and it gave it to LAFCO to draft another part.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO’s involvement is vital in order to ensure the bill can last in the state legislature.</p>\n<p>“They have hearings here in the community: it’s easier to go than to go up to Sacramento to testify for something,” said Farr.</p>\n<p>Farr said if the city wants to change the boundaries of a district, they have to go through LAFCO, and defining a specific district for the CSD requires LAFCO’s jurisdiction. Applying for a change in boundaries or districts involves a process during which proponents must obtain a certain amount of community support via petition form, pay an application fee and submit payment for fiscal analysis. According to Farr, this process is difficult to carry out in I.V. because of the temporary nature of the residents.</p>\n<p>“In a community like IV it’s very challenging to go through this process because [the process] is designed for permanent long term residents,” Farr said. “That’s part of why something like this hasn’t happened before by being generated from within the community.”</p>\n<p>In regard to finding a solution to what Farr described as a lack of permanent resident responsibility in I.V., Farr said there has been some discussion regarding changing boundaries to include university-owned housing and involve more students and staff in the self-governance discussion.</p>\n<p>“Who would decide that is the question right now, would it be the chancellor or the county, it would work to bring the community more longevity and stability,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, LAFCO will be able to take a position on the matter when the language of the AB 3 is finalized. Farr also said it is difficult to detail specific aspects of the CSD, such as policing powers.</p>\n<p>“The CSD could have policing powers but law enforcement services are extremely expensive,” Farr said, “We would have to find more money as opposed to letting the county continue to foot that bill.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a facet of the community the CSD might be able to address is referred to as the “broken window effect,” which is when a community starts to look bad or degrade and then becomes more attractive for individuals to continue to destroy as opposed to maintain.</p>\n<p>“It kind of comes back to the built environment and having housing that’s attractive that makes students want to stay in the community after they graduate, creating a group of less temporary residents in Isla Vista,” Farr said.<br>\nAccording to Farr, I.V. requires a newly modeled CSD to address issues of public safety in the neighborhood due to its uniqueness, and there has always been student interest in the matter.</p>\n<p>“We need to address a model that is different than what we’ve done before. That’s what the committee member is working on right now,” Farr said. “There’s always been a lot of student interest from the very beginning, and ever since I’ve been in office there hasn’t been a six month period gone by when a student hasn’t brought up CSD and LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a special meeting will be held one week from today to discuss a new draft for AB 3, and despite the fate of the letter, LAFCO and the State legislature will continue tracking the bill and making suggestions.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a new issue though. What’s happened is that incidents that occurred last spring really galvanized the community, university and trustees,” Farr said. “AB 3 came out of the trustees’ report and this was their ultimate recommendation. It is definitely time once again to explore what options are out there and make some changes,” Farr said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60868\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60868\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/","id":4768,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4767,4766,4765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"IVRPD Seeking New Chairperson","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVRPD.jpg?resize=306%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVRPD.jpg?resize=306%2C456&ssl=1","description":"Former Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Board of Directors Chairperson, former Santa Barbara Housing Co-op Executive Director and former I.V.

Food Co-op board member Jeff Bessmer resigned after serving as IVPRD board member for over two years to pursue a job opportunity managing a co-op in Portland, Oregon.</p>\n<p>IVRPD director Alex Rodriguez has temporarily taken over the position as Chairperson and Director Pegeen Soutar moved to become vice-chairperson. Bessmer’s resignation has initiated a search for a permanent replacement, with the IVRPD currently collecting letters of interest to fill the vacancy.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the IVRPD board of directors will not be running a special election due to its high costs and arduous process.</p>\n<p>“We’ve never run a special election for a board member,” Soutar said. “They’re expensive and they’re complicated.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the selection process involves a given candidate sending in a letter of interest, speaking to the board at a meeting and answering any questions the board may have for the prospective candidate. Soutar said she is personally looking for a candidate that can balance the number of students and long-term residents on the board.</p>\n<p>“I like to have balance on the board,” Soutar said. “I think students have enthusiasm and great ideas, but I also think that long-term residents bring continuity.”</p>\n<p>Associate Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes to see the IVRPD board of directors increase their local involvement by sponsoring more events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see the [IVRPD] board sponsoring more community events like Meet Your Neighbor Day,” Schunk said. “[But] in the end it boils down to what there are resources for.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the Board of Directors is accepting letters of interest from prospective candidates from now until Mar. 6, and the letter should include the candidate’s name, address, contact information and a brief statement regarding their intent to run.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the IVRPD board is hand-selecting the new board member to complete Bessmer’s unfinished term as board member from now until Dec. 2016.</p>\n<p>“[The candidate] is appointed by the board and will finish out the outgoing board members term, which will be through December 2016,” Gould said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Although a CSD would traditionally need authorization from LAFCO, Williams’ bill bypasses that requirement in favor of approval by the state legislature in light of LAFCO’s disapproval of past I.V. self-governance efforts.</p>\n<p>Historically, every submission to LAFCO to turn I.V. into a CSD or give it other forms of local government has failed, with the commission rejecting CSD petitions for I.V. in 1972, 1975 and 1983 largely due to concerns over financial feasibility. The letter to be discussed next Thursday, written by Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Vice Chair Doreen Farr, expressed the commission’s concern about its lack of involvement in the approval process as well as issues regarding yet unwritten language of the bill and the role of landowners in the proposed CSD.</p>\n<p>“It appears that in its current form, AB 3 intends to bypass the LAFCO District formation process, which is of great concern to CALAFCO and the Santa Barbara LAFCO,” the letter states. “The bill does not state which services and powers are envisioned for a CSD. Usually CSDs fold in existing districts. Are new services envisioned?”</p>\n<p>Chair of the I.V. Property Owners Association Chuck Eckert said that establishment of a CSD for I.V. is unnecessary because the services needed to improve I.V. “already exist.”</p>\n<p>“The position of the property owners of Isla Vista is this: we don’t think that a community services district is necessary … because it wouldn’t address the problems that exist which we believe to be primarily behavioral,” Eckert said. “We believe that all the government institutions needed to address problems related to infrastructure and level of services already exist.”</p>\n<p>Eckert also said the appropriate action the legislature should take includes allowing LAFCO to approve or disapprove a CSD for I.V. after appropriate feasibility research has been done.</p>\n<p>“I think that the proper thing to be done … is to let Das Williams’ bill … set up the things that this commission cannot do,” Eckert said. “Let [the legislature] send the issue back down to [LAFCO] after, for your decision, after a neutral and thorough economic viability study to make a determination if a district is to be formed.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

Community Organizer Jonathan Abboud however said that continued neglect of I.V. by county entities such as LAFCO cannot continue if I.V. wishes to attain a form of self-governance.</p>\n<p>“The old LAFCO has a really bad reputation and history for shafting Isla Vista in the Goleta cityhood attempt and our own cityhood attempts,” Abboud said. “It’s been 45 years and nothing’s happened. It’s getting worse and doing nothing is not an option and I think that those who think we should do nothing should then do something themselves.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also said a CSD in I.V. could potentially improve property values for the area and make it a “better place to live.”</p>\n<p>“The bill does not have to bypass LAFCO; it’s still an idea, that’s just one consideration people in the community came up with,” Abboud said. “Even if a CSD is limited [in scope] some sort of policy implementation could improve Isla Vista … it could improve it in a behavioral sense and structurally.”</p>\n<p>But I.V. property owner John Putra said establishing a CSD by act of legislature could undermine the legitimacy of LAFCO by allowing anyone to bypass it.</p>\n<p>“I find the process here is very dangerous from the standpoint of setting a precedent that, once it’s adopted, is going to eviscerate LAFCO because anybody can get around the process by introducing a bill and proceeding to change districts, form districts, without the input of LAFCO,” Putra said. “If this LAFCO does not take a strong stand against this kind of process I think it’s going wind up becoming a powerless agency.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year psychology and political science double major and Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk, the option of limiting LAFCO’s role in a self-governance bill for I.V. is more due to practical necessity rather than a dislike or distrust of the agency.</p>\n<p>“As far as precedent is concerned, we have already set some sort of insurmountable precedent just by the nature of being Isla Vista; our situation is so incredibly unique that it requires a unique solution,” Schunk said. “The term ‘bypass LAFCO’ is not necessarily accurate … it’s not necessarily a dislike or distrust of LAFCO; it’s simply the idea that LAFCO may not be able to, given the powers that it has, provide us with all of the things that we need.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59668\" style=\"width: 301px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59668\" data-attachment-id=\"59668\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/lafco-delays-discussion-opposing-bill-ab-3/das-williams/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Das-Williams_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1276&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"EVPLA Cameron Schunk discusses AB-3 with students.

CSD include a user’s utilities tax, where a tax is levied on use of utilities services such as water, electricity and gas, per household. According to Eckert, because most properties in I.V. are “master metered” for water utilities for entire complexes, rather than individual units, the cost of paying taxes on water falls on the property owner, rather than the renter, which is a concern to property owners of I.V. regarding their taxes.</p>\n<p>I.V. property owner Brian Bailey said he does not want to see taxes in I.V. increase further.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been bypassed, you’ve been neutered. What’s up with that?” Bailey said. “I took out our tax bill and looked at it and saw our park district bonds that have been in place for [many] years. They comprise, on this random one I pulled out, 11 percent of my tax bill. I really don’t want more shit on my tax bill.”</p>\n<p>But while Schunk said he could not say if there was “huge community consensus” on the user’s utility tax, in small I.V. town hall meetings he said most attendees agree it is a fairer method of taxation.</p>\n<p>“If we were to do a property tax, we would see only property owners receiving that tax … and logically passing it down to us through increased rent,” Schunk said. “That’s not to say a user utilities tax won’t increase rent per se, but in the sense that cost of living will still increase if you increase taxes. That’s a fact, there’s no getting around that unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Eckert encouraged LAFCO to amend their letter to include language specifically opposing the bill unless it does not bypass LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“The letter should be that this commission, you folks, opposes the bill unless it is limited to certain things and unless it leaves the issue of whether or not this district is to be formed up to you,” Eckert said.</p>\n<p>Williams said in a prior interview in December that the details of the services and other specifics on the form and function of an I.V. CSD have not been established because further input is needed from the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“We do not have all of the details because it is our intention of course to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place,” Williams said. “We don’t want to rush and just decide what the shape is without continued community dialogue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD? Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation? – A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>LAFCO Commissioner Jeff Moorhouse said he thinks AB 3 raises questions about local government jurisdiction and that he opposes the bill entirely.</p>\n<p>“This issue is about, ‘Is it right for the state legislature to tell local people how to form a government?’” Moorehouse said. “AB 3 needs to be pulled. It needs to no longer exist and you need to go through the right process and let [LAFCO] help you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he respects Moorhouse’s position, he “respectfully disagrees” with it.</p>\n<p>“Part of what we saw at LAFCO is proof that perhaps Mr. Moorhouse needs to do more research into the exact nature of the legislative process for one, and perhaps also be more open-minded to … what we’ve been saying the whole time,” Schunk said. “We’ve never once said that we are doing this because we hate LAFCO and want them to have no part of this; that is not the issue here.”</p>\n<p>According to Moorhouse, who supports the letter in its present form, the university, the county and SBCC are partially responsible for perpetuating problems inherent to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I see the housing crisis, overcrowding, the planning, the parking, the lighting, the sidewalks — it’s all stuff that should have been done,” Moorhouse said.</p>\n<p>“Instead of coming here, ‘LAFCO come help us with a CSD’ you should be taking your time going in front of the county board of supervisors and tell them to start throwing some money your way to start fixing some of these problems because they do have the resources.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he disagrees with Moorhouse’s comments on LAFCO’s ability to adequately help I.V. given its history of shooting down prior self-governance proposals.</p>\n<p>“Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD?” Shunk said. “Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation?”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the county has limited funding to provide to I.V. because of the realities of governing the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr and most of county administrators will agree that the county is doing [its] best and if they could wave their magic wand they would have more revenues and resources for the people of Isla Vista,” Williams said. “But because they represent a countywide government they can’t [allocate] revenue just for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59590\" style=\"width: 328px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59590\" data-attachment-id=\"59590\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/doreen-farr-coffee-collab/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Doreen-Farr-Office-Hourse_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1184%2C788&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1184,788\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr spoke with students during her \\\"office hours\\\" at the Coffee Collaborative on Thursday afternoon.

Parks and Rec District (IVRPD) board member Paola De La Cruz, Moorhouse’s comments on getting the university more involved in governing I.V. already been tried without success.</p>\n<p>“We have seen that the university and entities in Isla Vista are not addressing these needs … there are other needs that need addressing and they aren’t doing that,” De La Cruz said. “So his response for us to go out to them and to ask for help. We have already done that … so we need to take a bigger step and do something that will actually address our needs.”</p>\n<p>Williams said AB 3 does not set such a precedent, nor does it seek to completely sideline LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“There are many CSDs that have been established by the legislature,” Williams said. “This would not be the first; it is not a precedent … LAFCO has an important role in the formation of local government and I want to respect that as much as possible … at the very least [LAFCO] should inspect the financial feasibility report and have an oversight role in the financial feasibility of a CSD for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, details on what LAFCO’s oversight role on financial feasibility will be for an I.V. CSD has yet to be determined and that the time for action on a new government for I.V. must happen soon, as the consequences of inaction could result in damage to the community.</p>\n<p>“To me that the most important thing here is that there are people who will be hurt by our failure to take action,” Williams said. “LAFCO might wonder why we are moving so quickly. We are trying to get a strong amount of public input but we are moving quickly because inaction is causing problems in Isla Vista and I am not willing to wait another thirty years for people take action.”</p>\n<p><em>The next Santa Barbara LAFCO meeting will take place at the Santa Barbara County Administration building on 105 East Anapamu Street at 2 p.m. at the Board of Supervisor’s Hearing Room.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted LAFCO chair Doreen Farr stating the letter was “agonized” for discussion.

The evicted tenants have filed small claims lawsuits.</p>\n<p>IVTU President Andrey Bogdanov said the aim of the march is to educate the community on the ongoing issue of mass evictions in I.V. and call on Majestic Asset Management, Inc. to grant the evicted tenants relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>“We would like to see the tenants as a united force, fighting for better housing in Isla Vista,” Bogdanov said. “These tenants were unable to defend themselves on their own because greedy out-of-town investors and the community should stand up for them because it can happen to any one of us. That is the reality.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about solidarity in Isla Vista, well this is the time to really see what that is. – Brandon Baker, I.V. resident and recent UCSB graduate</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a previous interview, President of Majestic Asset Management, Inc. Brian Lezak said Majestic complied with all the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and did not violate any laws.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak in an email. “We will defend their position in court which is the proper place.”</p>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic wants to give back to the I.V. residents by providing apartment housing that is clean and affordable, and the Abrego Villas renovations were in part made to reduce water consumption.</p>\n<p>“The management willingly made additional changes which will also allow the property to use other utilities more efficiently, which again is in support of the conservation goals of Isla Vista and Santa Barbara,” Lezak said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Andrew Prieto said he plans to participate in the picket to support the local community and “make a statement” about what kind of treatment residents are willing to accept from landlords.</p>\n<p>“Those removed from their homes will get the justice and equal treatment they deserve,” Prieto said. “The point of the rally isn’t to attack people or attack the property companies but bring attention to the injustices and hope that attention will foster a change.</p>\n<p>Brandon Baker, an I.V. resident and recent UCSB graduate, said he plans to attend the march to fulfill a desire to create positive change.</p>\n<p>“I just didn’t think it was enough to read about the eviction and sit at home,” Baker said. “I wanted to actually be a part of the movement or process to bring change. We talk about solidarity in Isla Vista, well this is the time to really see what that is.”</p>\n<p>Baker said the Abrego evictions present another example of poor treatment of resident in an environment in which students are already abused by landlords who charge too much for rent in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Rent’s already high enough and I have to buy food and gas and stuff too,” Baker said. “If we let them do this, it sets a precedent for other realtors to do the same thing. I’m already paying a lot of money to live in a shithole. I’ve literally seen my landlord last year pull up in a corvette … Students are being taken advantage of and this brings attention to that unfairness.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said IVTU plans to extend their campaign for fair rights for tenants beyond I.V.</p>\n<p>“We will be working to improve the legislation, working with our partners in the county as well as … working with statewide legislators,” Bogdanov said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, February 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/","id":4767,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4766,4765,4764],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
