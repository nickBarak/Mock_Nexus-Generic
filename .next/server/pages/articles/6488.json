With the show being held at UCSB’s Campbell Hall this past weekend, students and community members had three chances to watch over 30 women perform Ensler’s rousing play about the trials and tribulations women across the world face throughout their lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The topics addressed throughout the show include sexual assault, childbirth, eating disorders, sexual orientation, sexism and death. These tough scenarios are depicted throughout the various characters’ monologues and “Herstories.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Herstories” are original pieces written by UCSB students that are featured in the show, which shines a light on narratives of modern young women. Each one gives the performance a personal touch and individualizes the “Monologues” to where it is being performed at any given time. This year’s performance focused on seeing the issues within societal and cultural norms and discussing how individual women were able to confront the effects created by these topics.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After walking into UCSB’s performance space for “Monologues,” people were immediately greeted with tables filled with vagina-related merchandise, including paintings of the female anatomy, stickers and even the popular “Pussy Pops” —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vagina-shaped chocolates held on a stick, meant to be enjoyed like lollipops. The seating area was softly lit with pink lights while empowering music played. People were sitting with friends, and as the music began to fade away the stage darkened, prompting the show to commence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guided by three MCs, the show proceeded with over 20 monologues and “Herstories.” Throughout the show, the stage was lit in different colors, switching after every monologue — and with a set-free stage, all attention went to the women speaking. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"185562760\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86379\"><img data-attachment-id=\"86380\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/vagina-monologues-2019-confronting-the-taboos/unnamed-1-26/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?fit=1583%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1583,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?fit=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86380\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=738%2C954\" alt=\"\" width=\"738\" height=\"954\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?w=1583&amp;ssl=1 1583w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-3.jpg?resize=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using little to no props and wearing unobtrusive costumes only added to the fact that there was a spotlight on the women and that it was meant to stay on them and the accounts they presented. Each of these stories was meant to bring forth empathy and help the audience relate to the story. Every word spoken in the production was a woman’s account of her life or a specific event that happened. Knowing that these narratives are based off of real women’s lives helps people to truly understand the production and the truth behind the words spoken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every woman has experienced different things in her life, and that is what the monologues represent. This is why there were amazingly hilarious stories of a woman appreciating her body such as “The Woman Who Liked to Make Vagina’s Happy” as well as deep, heart-wrenching narratives of rape and war as seen in “My Vagina Was My Village.” That’s the point of the “Vagina Monologues” — to remind people that there are both good and bad stories when it comes to the lives of women around the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to help women who need support when they previously had none, the V-Day Spotlight campaign draws focus to a particular issue that needs to be addressed either in the United States or worldwide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the campaign calls attention to the issue of decarceration of women in prison and for programs in detention centers with goals to help women process past experiences and heal. By spotlighting this issue, V-Day Humboldt hopes to seek higher ethical treatment to women in prison. They also hope to bring attention to the factors that cause higher incarceration rates for women, including racism, poverty and violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This particular production of the “Vagina Monologues” also chose to help benefit another group. All proceeds from the production were donated to the group Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA), an organization that seeks to help eliminate all forms of sexual assault through providing services and education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this is what makes the “Vagina Monologues” special. Not only is this a show open for all to come and watch, but there is motivation behind the show. The people involved in the production want to tell the story of these women and want to do their best to help people who need it. They want to spread their stories to educate and to show people the lives of women around the world — and to donate to groups that raise awareness around issues that society often would rather ignore. The show is there to help, whether by teaching people about the violence in the world or helping others get over the social taboo of saying “vagina.”</span></p><div

Architecture Museum on campus before Sunday the 29, you will find an array of paintings, sculptures and multi-media fixtures that fall decidedly in the category of abstract. Beginning on May 14, six art MFA graduate students at UCSB — Emily Baker, Vanesa Gingold, Morgan McAllister, Tom Pazderka, George Sanders and Shannon Willis — debuted their theses in an exhibition at the AD&amp;A museum, which held a reception on Friday May 20. You can go and see the exhibits Wednesday through Sunday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. (8 p.m. on Thursday). If you’re worried about “not getting” any of it don’t worry, there’s a lot of variety and plenty of the art is just plain cool to look at.</p>\n<p>The installations each entail several separate pieces, usually around five to seven per artist. They run the gamut with regard to subject and medium. Pazderka focuses chiefly on wood sculptures, found objects and charcoal drawings on tar paper. Pazerka’s exhibit revolves around famous (and infamous) individuals who spent time living in cabins in isolation. His subjects, each given a charcoal portrait in his piece “Freedom Club” range from the violent to the visionary. In “The Freedom Club Cabinet of Ted and Henry,” terrorist Ted Kaczynski (aka the Unabomber) shares a wooden fixture with transcendentalist author Henry David Thoreau.

Books like <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism </em>and <em>Radovan Karadžić: The Architect of the Bosnian Genocide </em>litter the wooden frames and cabinets of the fabricated cabin fragments Pazderka uses. And the artist’s aversion to propaganda becomes ironic considering one of the Freedom Club members is Leni Riefensctahl, the infamous Nazi propagandist director (even more so given that her most noted work is <em>Triumph of the Will</em>, regarded as a masterpiece of both propaganda and art).</p>\n<p>Sanders’ exhibit features mainly sculptures, composed mostly of a few skeletal, architectural frames. There’s a clear emphasis on the line quality of the structures and the workmanship behind the materials. The constructions are made mostly of wood and rope, and demonstrate a contrast between the utility of these materials and the pure, non-functional aestheticism of the final art pieces. Sanders comes from a painting background, and several paintings accompany the sculptures. These images also depict the geometric gridlines that comprise the bulk of Sanders’ exhibit.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum from this extensive sculpture-work is McAllister. McAllister has several paintings on the back wall of the gallery in addition to a few wall-mounted, three-dimensional pieces. The paintings encompass large swaths of wall space; dubbed “Eleutheromania,” they are fairly conventional abstract images, boasting mainly hues and splotches of white, pink and red.</p>\n<p>Sharing the largest and most open museum space with McAllister and Sanders is Gingold. Gingold’s exhibit includes again mostly sculpture-work. Her surrealist-inspired pieces draw heavily on both the human body and insectoid structures. The acrylic, pigment and wood of the pieces “Private Viewing” and “Egg Case” all resemble bone and skin, or even possibly exoskeleton. A large centerpiece evokes a cocoon. Much of the material for this installation is abaca paper; the process of readying the abaca paper involves wetting it, beating it repeatedly and allowing it to dry and crack. The more severe the beating, the stronger and more translucent the material becomes. While Gingold’s pieces are abstract, they remain accessible. In some sense they’re delightful — all in shades of light pink and resembling mobiles you might put above a crib — in another way they manifest body horror straight out of David Cronenberg’s films, even evocative of Lovecraftian images.</p>\n<p>Diverging from the fixed pieces of her peers, Willis’ installation contains mainly video feed, played on either flat-screen TV’s or projected onto the wall. The bulk of her exhibit takes place in a dark room in a piece called “Falling in Love While Drowning.” The installation focuses more on mood than it does physical aesthetics. The video screens project images of a distressed Willis along with a young girl playing. The feeds imply some sort of tragedy, and largely suggest symbolism of time and progression.</p>\n<p>The final exhibit (although likely the first in sight upon entering the museum) entails both a sculptural and a performative element. Baker’s work is a tribute to movement and the human form. The centerpiece of the exhibit are the paint streaks on the wall that she left when she climbed up a gym rope covered in paint. The prints that her body left appear like large-lettered calligraphy in dark pigment in “The Ascent.” Surrounding the gym rope in the middle of the room are hip and knee replacements that Baker cast in bronze herself. Also prominent in the room is “Spinal Shift” a large, warped, yellow lattice-work made of latex, steel and bronze. Baker spoke to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about the nature of risk in the performance (both physical and ego-wise).</p>\n<p>“As a competitive gymnast you’re constantly showing and trying to be better, and to be better you have to be vulnerable, you have to allow criticism, which you have to do in art as well” Baker said. “There’s a lot of similarities in the gym that there is in the metal shop. You feel confident but you also might seriously injure yourself.”</p>\n<p>She continues to perform (although, sadly, not the painted rope-climb) by hoisting herself upside-down on the pull-up bar in an impressive feat of athleticism in the piece “Quiet Practice.” She goes every day of the installation at 3:30 [[p.m.?]] If you go, she’ll converse with you — there’s no artificial “performance” style of non-interaction.</p>\n<p>The overall verdict of the six theses is that while not every piece of every exhibit is amazing, many of them certainly are. Using many different forms and methods to cohere into unifying themes and symbols and images also creates a unique and immersive art-viewing experience. If you’re by the University Center, or on campus at all for the last few days of the exhibition, you would be wise to experience some amazing artistic talent and drop by the museum.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/","id":6485,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6484,6483,6482],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Biko House: Punks, Progressives and Politics","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Performing Art","publish_date":"2017-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Time and time again, the Biko House has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial events in the United States. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">In September of 2005, the <i>Nexus</i> released an article titled “The Rise of the Biko Empire,” praising the recent influx of, as it described, a “wave of artsy combustion from soft white underbellies” in their garage venue. Most of the article describes the orchestrated chaos brought on by unique and flamboyant bands in 2005.</div>\n</div>\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ending of the article caught my attention, as it asked readers the question, “What’s in store for the future of the Biko House?” Even though I believe the question refers to Biko’s musical scene, I don’t think the writer or any student in 2005 for that matter could have predicted how our world would be today.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I do not want to dive into the details of the United States’ current socio-political climate, but if you don’t know already, it’s bad. It has probably always been bad and my younger self just didn’t take notice. It might have been because politicians were more into dog-whistle politics than directly saying absurd, problematic things out loud. But whatever the reason, Biko’s empire has risen to the occasion and become more than just a musical empire.

Time and time again, Biko has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial happenings, like those from 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After the racially charged incidents that occurred at the University of Missouri, Biko’s Garage was open to UCSB faculty and staff, students and local residents to discuss and stand in solidarity with the Mizzou protests. After the recent unfoldings of the presidential election, BIKO has served as an oasis of peace. Activism can be tiring, not just physically but mentally; sometimes that’s not something one wishes to bring back home. Many of Biko’s residents participated and continue participating in progressive work outside of the house.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko Garage, Isla Vista’s rectangular punk haven, is a cement room with capacity for maybe three and a half cars, or, on Friday night, 30 or so college kids with adrenaline to burn. Sound bled from the squat building as I approached it last weekend, my heart already in sync with the bass drum’s boom. “Wait!” called my friends, whom I’d started to outpace, but my legs wouldn’t listen. Biko zoomed up in front of us: two adjoined garages, one of which was closed but pulsing with noise; the other serving as a merch tent/lounge where some kids were hanging out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Drawing up to a table on which sat some flyers, a jar stuffed with dirty dollar bills and a pair of hairy forearms, I fished a $20 bill from my pocket and slapped it down, with maybe a bit too much gusto, as the owner of the forearms raised his eyebrows and gave me change. I stuffed the remaining $5 bills into the jar, and together we walked to the door, which was shaking. I gripped the greasy doorknob, turned it and leaned in. The four of us walked into the sun. We surfaced for air, joining the crush of people that had migrated outside, waiting for Genocide Jack. The crowd was, as a whole, black-shirted, lip-pierced and grinning—couple of camo swatches, a spark of Day-Glo hair.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During a particularly raucous song of the band’s set, lead singer Brian Bellrose crossed the invisible line between stage and stands, whirling around and bouncing off his fans. The zone surrounded me, a pink punk mist. Nothing else mattered. The only distinction between Bellrose and the people who’d paid $5 to see him was the mic, and even that he gave away, giving literal voice to anyone with something to scream. Most of it was indecipherable, but the message was clear, loud and nonverbal: energy so vicious that it’s often misconstrued as anger. This conclusion is evidenced by punk performers’ offstage impressions — I’ve never met one who was anything but gracious, progressive and kind. That night was no exception.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After a rousing performance of the Beastie Boys’ “Fight For Your Right,” accompanied by much floor-thrashing, crowd-singing and a heartfelt thank-you from the band, the show was over, and we tumbled back into the night, dazed and a little confused.</p>\n<p>Music, art and activism are what is brewed up in Biko. To continue to stand by its message, Biko additionally tries to prioritize women of color and POC musical performers, but it still opens its doors to everyone. We have seen the future of Biko that was conceptualized back in 2005, and it’s beautiful. Effervescent, colorful, strong and full of spirit; whether it’s the music pumping out of the garage or a presentation on vegetarian inclusiveness, Biko has become a platform for those without platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

stage of Campbell Hall on Saturday June 1. Hosted by Maddy Mokes and including performances by guests from UCSB and the surrounding area, the showcase was the epitome of what dance aims to be: supportive and uplifting. This aura of positivity was underscored by Urban’s charity of choice, Everybody Dance Now!, a nonprofit that teaches street dancing classes to youth who would not have such opportunities otherwise.</p>\n<p>The show began with some technical difficulties, yet the dancers maintained their composure and delivered a sharp rendition of their competition set, which expressed themes of patriotism and gratitude for freedom. And also booty shaking.</p>\n<p>The piece was loaded with jaw-dropping moments, including a particularly impressive whacking section and a backflip. With sound issues behind them, the team kicked off the show on a high note and hyped the audience up for the incredible performance to come.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Host Maddy Mokes espoused plenty of wholesome wisdom throughout the night, adding an endearing touch to the breaks between sets. At one point, Mokes told the crowd that she heard someone express their nervousness backstage. She stated that nervousness equivocates to caring and hard work, earning heartfelt “awwws” and cheers from the audience.</p>\n<p>The next UDC set showcased the talent of the first-years of the company. Adhering to the theme of monsters, the freshmen were able to showcase their specific talents and also their class’s overall collective technique and skill level. The second-years of Urban offered a more contemporary take on hip hop, which added a nice reprieve from hard-hitting pieces prior. With a mash-up of several Billie Eilish songs, including “You Should See Me in a Crown,” “Bury a Friend” and “Bad Guy,” the second-years brought a refreshing piece to the show.</p>\n<p>One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was Ventura-based company Undeclared. While certainly fun-sized, this group of dancers ranging in age from four to 17 years old packed quite a punch. The kids brought the house down with their ferocious attitudes and excellent foundation of technique as well.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88946\" style=\"width: 705px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1525633553\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88944\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88946\" data-attachment-id=\"88946\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/urban-dance-company-ignites-campbell-hall/screen-shot-2019-06-05-at-9-02-01-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?fit=1718%2C1260&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1718,1260\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-05 at 9.02.01 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?fit=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?fit=888%2C651&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM-1024x751.png?resize=695%2C510\" alt=\"\" width=\"695\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?resize=1024%2C751&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?resize=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-9.02.01-PM.png?w=1718&amp;ssl=1 1718w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88946\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Urban Dance Company</p></div>\n<p>The show was filled with fun and funky highlights that were packed with personality and technical excellence. The UDC girls set paid tribute to the ’90s, full outfits and all. The core members — comprised of the director, artistic directors, team captain and other administrative roles on the team — performed an iconic tribute to Justin Bieber, outfitted in purple, reminiscent of Bieber’s earliest era.</p>\n<p>The UDC guys’ set was one of the most impressive of the night. It began very fluidly, with a smooth, R&amp;amp;B-backed piece with a seamless transition into a hard-hitting segment. The dancers showcased their diversity of talent within the many genres of hip hop in a very short amount of time. Yet what was perhaps most impressive was their willingness (and success) to play with stereotypical male gender roles, set to Lizzo’s “Boys,” of course.</p>\n<p>A prime standout moment of the show was the freestyle competition which included members of Urban as well as their guests. The competition epitomized the supportive and lighthearted nature of dance, particularly as all of the participants and audience members rallied around the youngest member of the competition from Undeclared, who — let’s be honest — absolutely killed it.</p>\n<p>Adding to the diversity of the show was Urban’s first-ever contemporary dance set. Set to Leon<br>\nBridges’ gorgeous ballad “River,” members of UDC expressed themes of community and victory while<br>\novercoming mental health struggles, something they noted that dance helps them achieve. The dancers<br>\nbeautifully conveyed these themes through their elegant and sophisticated set, which was both<br>\ntechnically and emotionally stunning.</p>\n<p>Year after year, Urban Dance Company continuously reminds UCSB why they are so phenomenal. In addition to their flawless technique, fun sets, song choices and amazing stage presence, they also continue to give back to their community. Whether it be an issue of mental health or children’s dance educations, they are always stepping up.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
