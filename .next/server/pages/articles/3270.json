When I first came to UCSB, I didn’t really like it here, and being in the residential community was something that really changed that for me,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Voss said she recognized the importance of RHA’s primary focus on event planning and management, she felt that the association could further expand its supply of resources for residents by providing more professional and academic opportunities in the dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have safe, alternative events that people can go to. But I also think that’s not what makes living in the dorms better. I think what makes living in the dorms better is having different kinds of facilities, opportunities and resources that you don’t get off campus,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these insights in mind, Voss ran for RHA president against incumbent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kyle Bates</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in spring  2018 and won.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came into the position this year not necessarily knowing what I was getting myself into. I knew that I loved RHA’s mission, and I loved the fact that we get to do work that’s so personal and intimate,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Voss’s biggest goals this past year was working on the expansion of professional and academic resources for residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is currently implementing a series of workshops focused on event planning and management. The workshops would teach students the basics of event planning, from making room reservations to funding requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her presidency, Voss prioritized building connections with offices such as Residential and Community Living (RNCL) and Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE). She said that she noticed a disconnect between these entities and residents and took it upon herself to become an intermediary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not that these offices don’t care about these issues, it’s that they don’t know about them. Their offices are separate from students, and they don’t really employ students in their offices,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss explained that higher entities are often uninformed about everyday residential issues such as laundry malfunctions. She feels that by maintaining stronger channels of communication between these offices and RHA, these problems can be solved more efficiently and effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m someone who’s not really afraid to stand up and advocate for students, and I’m not someone who’s going to say I’m going to do something and then not do it. For me that has to do with going into a conversation with these offices with a really clear plan of exactly what I’d like to do,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is also committed to seeking creative, alternative sources for funding when entities like RNCL are not equipped to fund certain programs. This includes applying for grants from the Zero Waste Committee and seeking funds from other organizations on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we do have great sources of funding as RHA, I’m definitely willing to look to other resources if we can’t fulfill the kinds of things that I think are important to students through those resources,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As RHA president, Voss attended </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PACURH (Pacific Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls) housing conferences at UCLA and Southern Oregon University in November</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fifty schools from the Pacific Region, which includes California, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington and Oregon, were invited to the conference.. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss said the money for conferences came entirely from fundraising and not student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss also created “Resources with RHA,” a program that distributes hundreds of free midterm materials in the residence halls every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She  is also working with several members of RHA to create a new position in Hall Councils next year: an International Student Engagement Chair. The position will work closely with the Office of International Student Services (OISS) to ensure adequate resources and opportunities for international students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After completing her first year as RHA president, Voss decided to run again in an effort to accomplish her longer-term goals and projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constant changes in leadership affect the productivity of student government each year, Voss said. This problem is especially pertinent for RHA, she added, since living in the residence halls is a requirement of being in the organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every single year RHA is completely different than the previous year, and very few of the projects are long-lasting,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss took 63% of the vote in this year’s RHA elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I can take a lot of things I’ve done this year and make it even better for next year in a way that leaves a stronger foundation for the next RHA,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited for the fact that in RHA we really have the agency to accomplish a lot of wonderful things, and that I feel like I have such a stronger idea of how RHA works and how to actually get projects off the ground,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Editor’s Note]: Laila Voss is a copy editor for the</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Daily Nexus</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Come to this social or this event,’ and you’ll go but you’re not really immersed.

You don’t connect,” Schaefer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As co-president, Schaefer said she was drawn to the position of Programming Vice President because she felt it was unique among the other executive positions in regard to the interactivity with regular students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the Manzanita presidency opened up, I thought that by being president I could do more, and you can, but you don’t really have opportunities to throw events.

This is not mental health care. #StopTransingKids #TruthisNotAHateCrime” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling males women, or females men is the very definition of misgendering </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I feel deeply disrespected by the notion that any male can call themselves a woman and be considered the same gender as me. #MalePrivilge #TransWomenAreMen #TruthIsNotAHateCrime”  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “If you ever had a dick you aren’t a lesbian, not now, not ever.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 26: “Genital cutting of any kind does not change one’s sex and can never make a man into a woman.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 14: “Trans ‘women’ are men, ffs”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2: “Stand up for your son because he is perfect the way he was born – a boy.

to her tweets, students have called Tanner “absolute trash,” a “dumb bitch” and “a gatekeeper of womanhood.” One student tweeted “that bitch needs to die.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other responses on Twitter called for Tanner to lose her job, arguing that Tanner’s beliefs interfered with her ability to teach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the nearly 400 UCSB alumni echoed some of the rhetoric seen on Twitter, demanding that the university take steps to protect transgender and genderqueer students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instructors should not promote material in the classroom and department that denies the reality of trans people’s experiences or reifies gendered and sexed binaries as essential or real,” the authors emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues are not merely an academic debate; when the academy legitimates transphobia, it lends credence to an ideological position that systematically disenfranchises and kills trans people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the graduate students also spoke out in support of “trans, non-binary and sex working students at UC Santa Barbara,” stating that “in our classrooms, curricula, and professional interactions, we are committed to supporting trans and sex working students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As part of Feminist Studies, we are committed to cultivating intersectional, student-centered learning and community environments. To the students who have been harmed by transphobia and anti-sex worker rhetoric in our department, we are so sorry.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While neither letter mentions Tanner directly, both letters were released shortly after Tanner faced backlash on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two second-year UCSB students, Kyremina Youssef and Ari Moini, saw Tanner’s posts on Twitter and decided to organize the June 13 demonstration to make the greater student body aware of Tanner’s social media posts. The demonstration echoed the themes of the two open letters: that those who hold transphobic beliefs should not be allowed to teach at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moini said she believes it is “unsafe for the trans community on campus” for Tanner to teach at the school, and Youssef added that the two would hold additional rallies if Tanner continued teaching in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that while she knows Tanner is “protected by her First Amendment on Twitter,” the students are “also showing our First Amendment [rights] on campus by advocating for our community here and spreading awareness.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi and Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated [11:34 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

According to quarterly reports from the CDTFA, however, the entire state yielded only $35 million in cultivation tax revenue in 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Steel said the state is using the cultivation tax for administrative purposes, namely to “hire people to process the applications for [marijuana] growers and to make sure that legal growers are abiding [by] codes and to shut down illegal growing operations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to change where the money goes, Steel said, is to start locally. Aside from engaging with UCSB student leaders about the tax, Steel said he is also focused on “trying to get our student body aware of the situation.” He hopes to rally enough student support so that local lawmakers will consider amending the tax to grant the campaign access to the revenue stream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara County Board of] supervisors are revisiting [how the cultivation tax can be used]. If we’re able to show large community support behind it, I think we will bring the issue to the forefront of the supervisors’ attention,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel also acknowledged that UCSB students are not unique to facing financial insecurities. He described the situation as a “county issue,” noting that students at several other universities in the area — such as Hancock College and Santa Barbara City College — face similar economic hardships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Moon said he could help support the initiative by “writ[ing] up a resolution in support of this campaign” within the A.S. Senate next year and by reaching out to various campus organizations to further bolster the campaign.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, both Moon and Steel said the campaign’s foremost goal is to garner support at the July 9 Board of Supervisors meeting in Santa Maria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really trying to build from the ground up a coalition of grassroots movements. We’re [aiming] to make those who could affect change, like the board supervisors, aware of the needs and concerns of the tens of thousands of students in the county,” Moon said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

An additional $2.9 million will go toward financial aid for domestic nonresident and international students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the Regents </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">raised</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nonresident supplemental tuition by 3.5%, or $978. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said the increase was necessary to avoid “another $30 million hole” that would “have an impact on the educational program we can provide our undergraduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.7 million of the revenue raised will go to UC Santa Barbara, according to David Alcocer, associate vice president of budget analysis and planning in the UC Office of the President (UCOP).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents originally voted to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/uc-regents-table-non-resident-tuition-increase/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">table</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the tuition increase in March, citing concerns about undocumented students who live in California and pay nonresident tuition in addition to the UC’s financial accessibility to nonresident and international students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP believes there are likely 30 or fewer undocumented students in the UC system who do not qualify for in-state tuition, according to Alcocer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t explicitly track [undocumented status],” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Michael Cohen initially proposed an amendment in the meeting to make the increase in tuition contingent on legislative action to expand financial aid protections for undocumented students. However, the amendment failed 11-9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP is currently working with legislative staff on AB 1620, which would expand eligibility for non-AB 540 undocumented students, according to Alcocer.

Approximately 5,000 nonresident students’ families have incomes of $58,000 or under, according to data provided by the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may19/b2attach4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Office of the President</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Students Association (USCA) was one of the loudest voices opposing the tuition increase.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_UCSA/status/1129102698769309697\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">addressed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the Board of Regents Thursday, USCA President Caroline Siegel-Singh and University Affairs Chair Nuha Khalfay said they were in “strong opposition” to the proposed increase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By making our institution more and more inaccessible for non-Californians, we are building a wall around our institution and pushing out anyone who did not have the privilege of living in California at the right time,” the two said in the letter.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.
