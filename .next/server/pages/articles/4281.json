In her honor, the juggling community of I.V. began organizing a benefit show which ultimately turned into the now-three-day festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is an extremely welcoming environment and commonplace for people to approach total strangers for help or to engage in group juggle passing,” Fiasco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
