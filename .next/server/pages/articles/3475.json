Daily Nexus File Photo.</p></div>\n<p>He has advised the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>This past year, he finished his term as an elected chairman of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, which includes 45 of the top research universities across four continents surrounding and within the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>Since 2007, he has been the chairman of the Thirty Meter Telescope project, a partnership between the University of California, Caltech and institutions across the globe working to build a telescope 30 meters in diameter in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. He has also guided nine UCSB Ph.D. candidates with research grants from the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, he has served on the President’s Committee for the National Medal of Science, a U.S. presidential appointment that recommends winners from a pool of nominees to the President of the United States. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Society for Engineering Education and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.</p>\n<p>And for the last 20 years, he has served as chancellor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Henry T. Yang was invited to become UCSB’s fifth chancellor in 1994 after leaving his position as dean of the Schools of Engineering at Purdue University.</p>\n<p>“I was honored and pleased to be invited to UC Santa Barbara as … chancellor,” Yang said in an email. “To build a pre-eminent world-class research university with excellence and diversity and with the fulfillment of its responsibilities of teaching, research, and service is a mission that will never end.”</p>\n<p>Yang received his bachelor’s degree from National Taiwan University and his Ph.D. from Cornell. According to the Office of the Chancellor, he specializes in aerospace structures, structural dynamics, composite materials, finite elements, transonic aeroelasticity, wind and earthquake structural engineering and intelligent manufacturing systems.</p>\n<p>Yang said he took the job with aspirations of continuing and strengthening the university’s tradition of academic excellence and called the job “exciting and rewarding.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the number of freshman applications has quadrupled from 17,000 in 1994 to 66,800 this year, while the GPA of the entering class has risen from 3.47 to 3.98 in that same period. Earlier this month, U.S. News and World Report ranked UCSB as one of the nation’s top ten public universities.</p>\n<p>Former Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud said Yang has played a vital role in intensifying the university’s prestige.</p>\n<p>“Because of him we went from being a backwater UC in 1994 to being one of the top research universities in the world,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of the reasons he has remained with UCSB include the university’s election to the Association of American Universities, with five UCSB faculty members and one alumnus winning Nobel Prizes. With characteristic humility, he credits everyone who attends, works at or otherwise contributes to UCSB as grounds for its success.</p>\n<p>“With the vision and hard work of our faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, and supporters, I have had the tremendous honor and joy of witnessing the exciting growth of UC Santa Barbara,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Abboud, who worked closely with Yang during his time as A.S. president, said although he and the chancellor did not “agree 100 percent on everything,” both shared a mutual respect, especially after dealing with the tumultuous events of last Spring.</p>\n<p>“Well I don’t have experience with any other chancellor, but I do know that he has students at the top of his list of priorities,” Abboud said. “If people had a sit-in in his office, instead of run away like other administrators at other campuses do, he would talk to students and try to solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Aside from his administrative responsibilities, Yang also teaches a structural engineering once a year to 50 undergraduates in the College of Engineering. Though Yang holds many accolades under his belt, he said his distinguished teaching award from the UCSB Academic Senate is the award he holds most dear.</p>\n<p>“I see him involved a lot,” third-year biology and communication double major Caitlin Weis said. “It seems like he’s more involved with the community than most chancellors.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Mechanical Engineering Department Francesco Bullo said Yang “has a ton of experience, infinite wisdom and positive energy” and for this reason is happy to have him in the department.<br>\n“I believe our students love working with him and learning from him,” Bullo said in an email. “He’s always ready with a word of advice and encouragement, and he’s so organized and knowledgeable.”<br>\nIndeed, Yang said he is happy to be chancellor.</p>\n<p>“I am so honored and pleased to serve UC Santa Barbara, and to witness it growing steadily and exponentially in excellence, diversity, and world-class stature,” he said. “I look forward to many years of working with our faculty, students, staff, and alumni, and to continuing our exciting journey together.”</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <i>Daily Nexus.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/","id":3475,"author":{"id":191,"name":"Hannah Nelson"},"related":[3474,3473,3472],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":191,"name":"Hannah Nelson","biography":"Not available","articles":[3049,3475,3487],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Self-Governance in Isla Vista: An Uncertain Future","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":" When tear-gassed strangers came stumbling down Pasado Road, lost and confused after the Deltopia riots, local parks official and 30-year Isla Vista resident Pegeen Soutar did more than offer them was...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Students, A.S. Call For Community Service District; Officials Remain Doubtful</h2>\n<p>When tear-gassed strangers came stumbling down Pasado Road, lost and confused after the Deltopia riots, local parks official and 30-year Isla Vista resident Pegeen Soutar did more than offer them washcloths and water. As a member of the Isla Vista Parks and Recreation District, she thought about the future of community voice in the governing of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, Isla Vista is an unincorporated district. According to fifth-year biological anthropology major Josh Plotke, I.V. is basically Santa Barbara County’s “unwanted stepchild.” Plotke said I.V. produces a decent amount of money for the County, but the money goes to other areas of the County rather than toward resources and improvements for the small student community.</p>\n<p>Without proper public representation, Plotke said, small projects like installing streetlights and sidewalks will continue to be swapped for embellishments to downtown locations.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of Deltopia, Plotke has looked to one solution for increasing the autonomy of I.V. — making it a Community Services District, or CSD. If made into a CSD, I.V. would have its own independent form of governance.</p>\n<p>As defined in a 2001 report of local government options for I.V., a CSD would absorb all independently-run services in the district under one governing body. Currently, the I.V. Parks and Recreation District, or IVPRD, is the only such service in the community, and it includes an attached administration and elected board. By definition, a CSD would absorb the IVPRD’s authoritative powers, as well as control over street lighting and landscaping from the County. Services such as water supply, wastewater treatment, law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services would be left untouched.</p>\n<p>According to Plotke, a CSD would give I.V. the representation it lacks — a problem that was brought to the forefront by regular cases of sexual harassment and the violent Deltopia riots last month. In light of these issues and the lack of physical infrastructure such as public walkways, Plotke said I.V. is in need of more for its community.</p>\n<p>“There’s supposed to be sidewalks everywhere,” Plotke said. “And if this was actually a politically organized area, there’d be sidewalks a long time ago.”</p>\n<p>However, Soutar said a CSD is not the answer to I.V.’s woes. In response to Deltopia in particular, Soutar said the event will only wind down once there is a local cultural shift and students stop inviting out-of-towners and become more conscious of their surrounding community. Basically, no one but the residents can fix this issue, she said.</p>\n<p>“To create another whole layer of government — to add sidewalks or more lighting — does not seem like the right direction for me.”</p>\n<p>Instead, she suggests creating advisory board to give the half-square mile of I.V. some sort of voice in the County. However, the controversy lies in how members of this board would be selected and in determining what larger governing body this board would be a part of, Soutar said.</p>\n<p>For Soutar, the board would feature four key players: main governing bodies of I.V., law enforcement, other I.V. groups and additional stakeholders. Sitting with the main governing bodies is a representative from Santa Barbara County, one from IVRPD and one from the University. Law enforcement includes the County Sheriff and representatives from the UC Police Department and I.V. Foot Patrol. Other I.V. groups at the table may include the housing co-ops, the I.V. Tenants Union and the I.V. Youth Project. Student and non-student residents, property owners and homeowners would be present as additional stakeholders.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs-elect Beatrice Contreras, her ideal table focuses on more communication between the University and the I.V. community, as well as between local law enforcement and A.S. Contreras said she seeks to establish a forum for students to communicate with law enforcement officials like the UCPD and IVFP.</p>\n<p>“The year progressed and I began to think to myself, especially after the sexual assaults, ‘Wow, we need to mobilize. We need to do something,’” Contreras said.</p>\n<p>The idea of a CSD has been gathering momentum in A.S., as EVPLA Alex Moore said he came across the idea last fall while researching alternatives to making I.V. an actual city. Now the idea is gaining more fans, as Contreras said making I.V. into a CSD is an idea that seems to resonate with students.</p>\n<p>“One thing that really affects everything that goes on is representation, and we don’t have a lot of that,” Contreras said.</p>\n<p>She said students in I.V. receive representation in two ways: through the IVRPD and A.S. local affairs members attending County board meetings. Nonstudents, however, do not necessarily have their voices heard.</p>\n<p>“The EVPLA does a lot of the work for representing students, but oftentimes that means that nonstudent community members don’t have their voices represented,” Contreras said.</p>\n<p>According to Contreras, County installment of surveillance cameras instead of using the money for streetlights or bystander intervention training stood as an example of when the voices of I.V. residents were lost.</p>\n<p>“If we had funneled all those reactive measures into more proactive measures, I think that that could have really helped,” Contreras said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Contreras said the University has had little to do with Deltopia in previous years. But now, the University must start to address the issue of Deltopia and get more involved in educating students on what can go wrong during such events and how to deal with those consequences, she said.</p>\n<p>“The University has a lot of connections that could have really helped mediate the situation,” Contreras said, “Instead, it just blatantly ignored it, kind of pushed it under the rug.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Moore said the process to come up with a solution to Deltopia is highly challenging. Moore said the majority of people unanimously agree that the event cannot continue on without intervention, but “no one necessarily sees a path forward.”</p>\n<p>“It’s been pretty hard to find some leadership as far as students go on that,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>According to Plotke, he has been researching the possibility of a CSD since last summer, before coming to A.S. to present his ideas in the fall. However, when Plotke met with Moore, the two came to disagreements over their respective CSD plans and aspirations.</p>\n<p>“It just doesn’t make any sense that he would try to shut me down when I was secretly his biggest asset,” Plotke said.</p>\n<p>Since then, Plotke and Moore have been each carrying out their own plans for creating a CSD.</p>\n<p>Moore said he hopes future EVPLAs will continue to work on building the momentum for a CSD so it could possibly be on the ballot in November during the general election period.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to take more than just one person to figure out how to fix and bring some self-governance to Isla Vista,” Moore said. “It’s not going to be a solo crusade.”</p>\n<p>Despite the efforts of both Plotke and Moore, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said he is reluctant to believe a CSD will solve the problem of an out-of-control Deltopia and other community problems. His opinion is similar to Soutar’s since he said he does not believe a self-governing community is the actual key to solving Deltopia-like events.</p>\n<p>“It’s a recurring event, but it started almost in a spontaneous manner,” Brown said. “As it has continued and has recurred year after year, I’m not quite sure it would make a whole lot of difference whether it was in a city or in the County or in a special district.”</p>\n<p>In response, Plotke said he feels skeptical of the Sheriff’s allegiance to Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure he’s way more worried about whatever’s happening in the rest of the County,” Plotke said. “The only time that worries him is when I.V. gets a riot or something.”</p>\n<p>In fact, opposition to a CSD may be due to officials trying to prevent I.V. from having more control over County money, according to Plotke.</p>\n<p>“There’s an interest for things not to go well. As long as things are a mess and there’s no governance, they’re just jacking the money,” Plotke said. “But as soon as there are actually people watching over, all of the sudden, they’re not going to be able to keep stealing from the pot.”</p>\n<p>Rodney Gould, general manager of the IVPRD, said Plotke is missing two key numbers in his argument: the amount of the current property taxes that would stay in I.V. and what portion of this money would go to the County. Gould also said the financial feasibility of a CSD is questionable.</p>\n<p>In addition, Gould said another one of his main concerns is that potential board members who lack a “long-term stake” in the community will impose measures on people who are “stuck here, left paying for the consequences.”</p>\n<p>Regarding the implementation of an advisory board, Soutar said while one would be nice, individual residents can make a difference in the community at this very moment. For her, the issue is not the noise, the booze or even the party vibe — all she wants is the elimination of violence and crime.</p>\n<p>“I dig this place — I like how creative people are; I like how fun people are … I don’t mind the loud noise; I don’t mind the beer pong everywhere — that doesn’t bug me,” Soutar said. “I just don’t want the violence; I don’t want the destruction.

The purpose of the bill is to assure that law enforcement has adequate information when responding to welfare calls.</p></div>\n<p>The California State Senate unanimously passed Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s bill to prevent gun violence last Friday, and the bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown, who must approve the bill by Sept. 30 for it to become law.</p>\n<p>The bill was introduced following the events of the May 23 Isla Vista mass shootings which killed six people, three of gunshot wounds, by SBCC student Elliot Rodger. Three weeks prior to the shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted Rodger as part of a welfare check at his parent’s request but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. SB 505 requires law enforcement agencies across the state to develop and implement policies encouraging officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms System prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, the purpose of the bill is to ensure that law enforcement has adequate information at their disposal when responding to welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill would help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Senator Jackson’s communications director Lisa Gardiner, while welfare checks can be conducted by law enforcement for various reasons, SB 505 only applies to calls where “there is a concern the person may be in danger to themselves or others.”</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover said. According to Hoover, deputies responding to the April 30 call for Rodger did not feel the need to consult the register based on their interaction with him at the time, and were thus unaware he possessed any firearms.</p>\n<p>Hoover also said deputies are empowered to ask individuals possessing weapons to voluntarily forfeit them during a welfare check but that responding to such calls alone does not permit the sheriff’s office to simply seize weapons.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said. “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60 to 90 days.”</p>\n<p>The Automated Firearms System will prove to be beneficial by virtue of making knowledge more accessible to law enforcement, which Amanda Wilcox of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in California said will put law enforcement “in a better position to protect their own safety” because “the more knowledge they have about what guns to expect the more they’re in a better position to protect their own safety.”</p>\n<p>“It’s an officer safety issue,” Wilcox said. “A lot of resources have gone into having the kind of database we have in California and we, including law enforcement, should be taking full advantage of that information.”</p>\n<p>The bill has received the support of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the California Police Chief’s Association. The latter group, according to Gardiner, lobbied for the bill to enable local law enforcement agencies to design policies on how law enforcement officers would consult the Automated Firearms Systems database.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, August 27, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Photo by Kenneth Song//<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Regents of the University of California held their last meeting of the summer at the UCSF Mission Bay Community Center last Wednesday and Thursday, where they appointed a new UC Irvine chancellor, discussed future plans regarding UC finances and received recommendations for the sexual assault task force recently created by UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>During public comment, speakers addressed the Regents about issues such as the UC’s investments in fossil fuel companies as well as University efforts to respond to sexual assault on campuses.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Napolitano discussed the UC investment portfolio and gave updates on the UC-Mexico Initiative and the UC Global Food Initiative. The University Committee on Educational Policy presented initial recommendations from the sexual assault task force and then discussed partnerships at UC Davis to advance food and health research.</p>\n<p>Educational Policy Committee Chair Regent Bonnie Reiss said the task force would continue its work into the next year and quickly draft a plan to implement its recommendations by July 2015.</p>\n<p>“As Regents we take very seriously our role as stewards of UC. We care about maintaining our role as the premier research institution on the planet,” Reiss said. “As important as this mission is, providing a safe environment is every bit as important, perhaps more important.”</p>\n<p>Members of the sexual assault task force included UC Senior Vice President Sheryl Vacca and fourth-year international development studies major UCLA Savannah Badalich, both of whom discussed task force goals before presenting seven overarching recommendations to the board.</p>\n<p>The recommendations included the creation of consistent a “response team model” at all campuses with separate focuses on reporting and prevention education; system-wide standard investigation and adjudication standards; a system-wide training and education plan for students, staff and faculty; community education about UC programs; creation of an independent confidential advocacy office for sexual violence on each campus; a system-wide website customized for each campus to provide students with resources regarding sexual assault; and a “standardized data set” leveraging existing sexual violence data, to report data in a consistent manner, with agreed upon definitions.</p>\n<p>Badalich said student respondents played a large role in generating some of the recommendations, especially the recommendation to establish an independent confidential advocacy office and the system-wide, campus-customized website.</p>\n<p>“Many students on campuses don’t know who to go to, who they can talk to about their assault without having to give a mandatory report,” Badalich said, speaking from personal experience. “After my assault I Googled ‘sexual assault at UCLA’ and the many different websites confused me, so one website would be very effective.”</p>\n<p>Badalich also emphasized how sexual assault prevention education and alcohol abuse education should not be “conflated” in new student orientation presentations and said that all faculty and staff should be required to participate in “survivor centered” sensitivity training.</p>\n<p>According to Reiss, the system-wide standardization of penalties and minimum responses following a guilty verdict in the university adjudication of a sexual assault case will be further assessed in Phase II of the task force’s work. Badalich also said the task force would keep itself open to additional recommendations in the work it does in Phase II.</p>\n<p>The Regents then convened the Committee on Finance and discussed the UC’s energy service programs to achieve climate neutrality in a presentation given by newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom and UCOP Vice President of Budget and Capital Resources Patrick J. Lenz.</p>\n<p>According to Brostrom, widespread efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are taking place across campuses, with each university cutting its emissions down to the same levels they were in 2000, as per University climate policy. Brostrom also said the UC is examining ways to reduce greenhouse gas output by eventually transitioning from burning natural gas to burning biomethane, with proposals on such efforts to come as early as the November Regent’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Brostrom and Lenz also overviewed the budget for the current fiscal year before discussing preliminary budget priority recommendations for the 2015-16 fiscal year. Among the preliminary recommendations for the priorities of the next fiscal year were a minimum of $120 to $130 million in mandatory costs, a minimum $195 million in high-priority costs and $50 million in “quality reinvestment” costs to increase graduate student support, reduce the student-faculty ratio and reduce faculty and staff salary gaps, among other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to a memo from UCOP to the Committee on Finance, the $120 million in mandatory costs are unavoidable costs that must be covered before other high-priority costs or initiatives can be funded. Lenz said if Governor Jerry Brown maintains his four percent increase in the UC’s general fund as part of his multi-year education funding plan — an amount of about $119 million — that revenue could “just fall short” of covering the proposed mandatory costs.</p>\n<p>Following the presentation, Regent Richard Blum said he is dissatisfied with what he described as the state’s “continuous” underfunding of the UC system.</p>\n<p>“We are now educating 78,000 more students with the same amount of money … than we did 25 years ago,” Blum said. “How do we do it? Larger class sizes, not a good thing. Greater tuitions, let buildings run down … there’s hardly a month goes by that I don’t hear about some dean or some chancellor worried about losing yet another good person because of a much better offer.”</p>\n<p>According to Blum, “corruption” in Sacramento is due to the UC’s current funding issues.</p>\n<p>“We at the University get the short stick,” Blum said. “We’re gonna turn this place into a community college if we keep going the way we are … after watching all this for all these years, I’m tired of it.”</p>\n<p>According to the slides of the Lenz presentation, between fiscal years 1990-91 and 2014-15, state funding for the UC grew 31 percent while inflation grew 80 percent. The UC also enrolled over 82,000 more students.</p>\n<p>The Regents then approved a $297 million dollar package to fund 15 capital improvement projects, mostly related to infrastructure and “seismic/life safety needs” as part of the 2015-16 budget for state capital improvements. One proposed project included $15 million in seismic work on UCSB’s Campbell Hall, subject to further review at the November Regents meeting.</p>\n<p>Prior to convening the Committee on Investments, the Regents heard from Jefferson Kuoch-Seng, a fourth-year management major at UC Merced and newly elected UCSA President who discussed the continuation of the IGNITE campaign, aiming to “dismantle the school to prison pipeline” as well as the recently announced UConsent campaign against sexual assault and sexual violence. Kuoch-Seng also spoke against tuition increases despite what he described as the UC’s “budget shortfall”.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Investments then heard a discussion item from UCOP Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bachher on the status of the UC’s investment portfolio in the last fiscal year. According to slides presented during Bachher’s presentation, the UC’s total assets under management grew almost 15 percent in the last fiscal year, increasing $78.4 billion to some $90 billion, described as an “all-time high.” The UC’s investments, according to Bachher, are approximately 70 percent in North America, with 10 billion dollars in Asia, and five percent in “emerging markets,” with roughly half the total assets invested in the stock market and 20 percent and 30 percent in alternative assets and fixed income sources, respectively.</p>\n<p>After lengthy discussion, the Regents also approved the establishment of UC Ventures, an independent fund to pursue investments in companies that use UC research, subject to approval of the Regents with an initial amount of $250 million to get started.</p>\n<p>“Its pretty clear that there are opportunities, they have been profitable for investors and they exist within our organization,” Bachher said. “It is a new way to finance and benefit from innovation within the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Regent Blum said he thought it would be difficult to attract investors away from private companies in the Bay Area and cautioned Bachher on the proposal.</p>\n<p>“Other universities have done it but … you are entering into a long hard struggle and I would be very surprised if you come back three or four years from now and you will have made any money at all,” Blum said.</p>\n<p>The President’s Task Force on Sustainable Investing also presented recommendations to the Regents on implementing sustainable investment practices. Bachher specifically addressed the demands of the student-led Fossil Free UC Campaign.</p>\n<p>Task force member Bachher said he recognized efforts made by Fossil Free UC toward fossil fuel divestment and said that of the UC’s $90 billion dollar investment portfolio, roughly 10 percent of it is anchored in energy investments. According to Bachher, divesting from companies in the top 200 of emitters would result in a divestment of $3 billion, while cutting coal investments alone would equate to a $500 million dollar divestment.</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion recommending the establishment and implementation of a framework on sustainable investment to be completed by June 2015 that integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a core component of “portfolio optimization.” The board allocated $1 billion over five years to investment pursuits in renewable power and fuels as well as in energy efficiency, among other possibilities.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Compliance then presented to the board several discussion items on the internal auditing activities conducted at all UC locations between July and August, as well as a presentation by UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks on recent NCAA rule changes and their impact on the PAC-12 conference, of which UCLA and UC Berkeley are members.</p>\n<p>During the Thursday morning session the Regents appointed Howard Gillman as UC Irvine’s sixth chancellor following the departure of former Chancellor Michael V. Drake, who has been serving as Ohio State University’s president since June.</p>\n<p>Gillman previously served as the provost and executive vice chancellor, and was interim chancellor for the Irvine campus since January. According to Napolitano, Gilman was selected after a four month national search from a pool of some 405 prospective candidates. The board also approved a $485,000 compensation package for Gillman.</p>\n<p>Chair of the Board of Regents Bruce Varner praised Gilman’s leadership ability and dedication during the appointment.</p>\n<p>“Strong leadership is central to the excellence of each of our 10 campuses,” Varner said in a UCOP statement. “Chancellor Gillman has demonstrated he has the leadership attributes, the vision and the dedication to public service needed to move UC Irvine forward with vigor and integrity.”</p>\n<p>Gillman gave a brief address following his confirmation by the Regents. Following Gillman’s remarks, the Regents reconvened the Committee on Compensation and passed an action item to develop a policy to keep the compensation of UC chancellors competitive compared to “peer institutions.”</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion to raise the pay of four UC chancellors who are among the lowest paid chancellors in the UC system, including UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The motion’s approval of increased Yang’s pay by roughly 20 percent, from $324,450 to $389,340.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal and UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland also had their compensation packages raised 20 percent with the passage of the motion. A five percent increase was also given to UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox in the same motion.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Health Services was then convened and heard a discussion on the current financial status of the UCSF Medical Center and its soon-to-open Mission Bay Hospital, as well as a discussion on the needs of each campus to address student mental health. Regent William De La Pena requested further investigation of mental health needs of students across UC campuses and asked for a more detailed report to be presented at the Regent’s November meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/","id":3474,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3473,3472,3471],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
