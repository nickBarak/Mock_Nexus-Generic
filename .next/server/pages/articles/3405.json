But international students, who compose 14% of the campus population, face the possibility that if they leave the country, they won’t be able to return.<em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if she could go back home, there was the looming possibility that she would either contract the virus while there or be denied reentry into the United States, and thus be unable to return to UCSB, she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall Quarter 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are 3,261 international undergraduate students attending UCSB — composing 14% of the campus population — as well as 914 international graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these international students are in the same situation as Xu — unable to return to their home countries, but unable to remain in the dorms without paying the $300 spring break housing fee. UCSB’s Global Gaucho Commission (GGC), a student organization that advocates for the interests of international students on campus, is working to alleviate that financial burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles K. Neumann, a fourth-year global studies and political science double major and co-founder and internal chair of GGC, explained that the organization made it a priority to push for housing vouchers for all students whose travel plans had been altered by the coronavirus, beginning in February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a survey conducted by the GGC of 100 Chinese students currently living in residence halls on campus, more than half of the respondents planned to either return to China or remain at a friend’s house or a hotel during spring break, Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But those results were from Week 6 of winter quarter, he noted, and “there are definitely students who are still having difficulty [with] finding places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative housing options that are currently available at UCSB are limited; students needing temporary housing must apply through the </span><a href=\"http://food.ucsb.edu/resources/housing/emergency-transitional-housing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Crisis Response Team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (FCRT), which approves each housing request one at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is a more universal kind of deal where all students who are affected by the coronavirus [are] being given housing vouchers,” Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But according to Neumann, the process of advocating for spring break housing vouchers for any students, international or otherwise, is not an easy process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two weeks of continuous back and forth with the administration — including a trip to Cheadle Hall to speak with an absent Chancellor Henry T. Yang, multiple attempts at talking to the Division of Student Affairs and a petition — the GGC was eventually directed to Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE), according to Neumann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been copying from one contact source to another,” Neumann said. “And initially, we kind of felt like they were just passing us along, to kind of shift responsibility to somebody else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 21, HDAE sent an email to students living in university-owned housing to offer them the opportunity to stay in their current dorm during spring break given “an extenuating circumstance due to the travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, students who opt for this extra week of housing must still pay the fee. Neumann argued that since the cost originates from “a circumstance that is completely beyond anybody’s control,” the GGC still plans to meet with Garry Mac Pherson, the vice chancellor for administrative services, to discuss waiving the fee entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GGC is exploring alternative payment avenues in the event that UCSB does not waive the housing fee, Peter Feng, a second-year economics major and external chair of the GGC, said. According to Feng and Neumann, potential options include reimbursements after spring break from either the organization or A.S., a food-specific waiver for eating out in local establishments when the dining commons are closed during break and housing waivers from the FCRT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing that the administration cannot provide, Xu said, is certainty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [courses become] online, we are kind of worried whether we should go back to China or just stay here,” Xu said. At the time, UCSB had only announced that classes would take place remotely </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through the end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rather than through the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entire spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “We’ll just wait and see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a growing concern … of international students not being able to go home and not being able to reenter the United States,” Neumann said, which could force international students to stay in the U.S. during the summer and possibly prevent new international students from entering the country in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“International students are being overlooked in terms of resources and just care, compared to domestic students,” Neumann said. “Even now, international students are still receiving inadequate support from the university administration compared to what they deserve.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the following days, weeks and months have in store, Xu expressed that this situation was not ideal for anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all hope we can get over with this, right?” she said. “I hope everything could get back to normal as soon as possible.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As a result, ID isn’t working to fully convert in-person classes into digital ones but to create “hybrid” classrooms by bolstering the teaching technology that’s already available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Yang first announced the switch to online coursework last Tuesday, ID has helped teaching staff incorporate programs such as </span><a href=\"https://collaborate.ucsb.edu/services/gauchospace\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://gauchocast.ucsb.edu/Panopto/Pages/Home.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panopto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.zoom.us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/from-course-to-source-new-learning-platform-streamlines-communication-between-students-and-professors/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into their online lectures by holding ongoing workshops, which will be hosted through spring break, Michaels said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the workshops, instructors can ask questions pertaining to the different software programs, such as how to take attendance, record and post lectures, distribute and grade assignments, hold digital office hours and even call on students when they digitally raise their hand, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a majority of the remote instruction tools aren’t new, according to Michaels. When the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> broke out in 2017, ID worked to equip instructors with tools to teach classes remotely in the event that in-person classes were canceled, which laid the groundwork for ID’s current efforts, Michaels said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to successfully meet the need [for online instruction] at that point in time and have retained those resources,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three to four weeks ago, Michaels said ID began preparing workshops and started assessing how prepared the university’s digital teaching materials were so that “if things really go sideways,” ID was “ready to move as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Michaels said some professors have had issues with online assessments, such as GauchoSpace quizzes, which can crash when too many students are tested simultaneously. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels said ID is offering instructors one-on-one consultations to work around these problems by providing solutions, such as making a GauchoSpace quiz available over a 12 to 24 hour period “to spread the impact out as much as possible” and prevent these systems from crashing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students on social media have also posed questions about the fate of their waitlisted classes next quarter, as digital classrooms lack the constraint of physical seating. Michaels said waitlists will still exist, as class enrollment information is stored in the campus registrar — “which constitutes the class roster” — and is fed into GauchoSpace.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classroom attendance will follow similarly, Michaels said; a professor using Zoom or GauchoCast can use their class roster on GauchoSpace to take attendance based on who joins the digital class, just as they would have done in a physical classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea is to try to keep that roster information as up-to-date as humanly possible. The wait list, and to a certain extent, the attendance tool, in the absence of a face-to-face class can be a way to emulate [that] the student shows up on the first day at class and walks up to the faculty member afterwards to get an add code,” Michaels said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels highlighted ID’s efforts to provide the university with different teaching solutions under a tight turnaround but acknowledged that access to online courses is still an issue for students who have to go home and don’t have a laptop or internet connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The campus recognizes that that’s a big issue and there are lots of people working really hard to try to come up with a workaround solution for that,” Micahels said, adding that the Enterprise Technology Services, Student Affairs and the University Library are currently working on a solution to provide students with long-term loaner laptops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But “the missing part is if they don’t have a network at home,” Michaels said, so a loaner laptop won’t be of much use if a student is looking to join their class on Zoom or GauchoSpace without an internet connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, however, Michaels said that most instructors, specifically the ones who attended workshops, have adjusted well to the transition from in-person to digital classrooms. He said the biggest issue lies in how confident each instructor feels in their ability to teach an online class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have over a thousand faculty members … we’ve got some faculty members who’ve been teaching fully online courses, primarily through summer sessions, for almost 10 years now. For them, this is an adjustment, but it’s using tools that they’ve already become very comfortable with,” Michaels said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For other faculty members, some elements of the technology landscape or ecosystem that we have is all new territory for them,” he added. “Everybody is figuring out how they’re going to cope with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As other UC campuses roll out their own remote instruction programs, Michaels said ID shares its new technologies, information and resources through the </span><a href=\"https://cio.ucop.edu/meet-the-educational-technology-leadership-committee/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educational Technology Leadership Committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (ETLC), a decade-old collaborative group that represents the ID office equivalent at each UC campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have regular monthly Zoom meetings. We have an annual face-to-face meeting. We’re constantly sharing information about things that are going on in our campuses,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As soon as campuses started ramping up [remote instruction efforts], one of the things that the ETLC did, besides communicating via email, is we started a Google doc with links to all of the resource sites that we were all developing or expanding,” he said, “so that all of us had the benefit of seeing what kinds of support we’re providing to our faculty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students prepare to go home for spring break, Michaels said ID’s chief concern is ensuring that instructors are prepared to teach classes remotely, while also continuing to improve the teaching resources that are already available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing that I really appreciated is that everybody recognizes that this is an unprecedented situation. The faculty members that have been coming to our workshops are uniformly thankful to have the help,” Michaels said. “They’ve been very supportive of us, which is awesome.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

UCSB, and Lines 4, 5, and 17 will still be running to Santa Barbara City College. However, Lines 15x, 16 and 28 will no longer be in service, according to Hillary Blackerby, the Metropolitan Transit District (MTD)’s planning and marketing manager.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Line 27 — the Isla Vista Shuttle — will be reduced to the “UCSB out” alternate schedule, which the line typically follows when the university is on spring break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 31, the MTD announced that Lines 10, 30, 34, 36 and 37 would be closed indefinitely, with the closures to go into effect April 6. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The March 31 press release also announced stricter load limits to follow social distancing protocols. Forty-foot buses will carry a maximum of eight passengers, with only five passengers allowed on 30-foot buses. In addition, drivers may pass a person waiting at a bus stop if the load limit is already met, the press release stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district will begin providing free fares for all passengers as well as changing procedures to practice social distancing in light of the COVID-19 crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to provide free service for all passengers was made to “minimize contact with bus operators” and the fare box, Blackerby said. Passengers are also asked to “maintain appropriate social distance on buses,” defined as six feet by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New social distancing procedures will include requiring passengers without mobility restrictions to load via the rear door, restricting person-to-person ticket sales and closing the administrative office to visitors, according to Blackerby, who sent out a </span><a href=\"https://sbmtd.gov/servicereductioncovid19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the changes on March 18.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All administrative offices will be closed and in-person ticket sales halted, although there will be no need to purchase tickets for the foreseeable future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby also said on March 16 in a separate press release that the MTD canceled all booster services to junior highs, high schools and the Alpha Resource Center from March 16 until further notice.</span></p>\n<p><em>[Updated: 4/5/20 4:23 p.m]</em></p>\n<p><i>[Correction 4/5/20 9:34 pm]: This article has been corrected to say that the new closures will go into effect April 6.
