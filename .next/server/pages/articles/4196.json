Since then the righty has allowed only seven hits and one earned run in 15.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason Bettancourt had such a rough time is because the Gaels have a slew of hitters that can take it to any pitcher in the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>These hitters include players such as sophomores Zach Kirtley and outfielder Joey Fiske. The two sophomores rank first and second in batting average with .360 and .331 respectively.</p>\n<p>Kirtley is first on the team in slugging percentage (.566) and on-base percentage (.473). The infielder is also tied for first in home runs (5), hits (49) and RBI (27).</p>\n<p>Senior infielder Anthony Villa is another strong hitter for St. Mary’s as he is also tied for first with Kirtley in home runs and RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior Nate Nolan is another viable hitter ranking second in hits (41), RBI (23), and slugging percentage (.500). The catcher had a solid game last time against UCSB going 3-5 (.600) with three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Although the Gaels are a strong hitting team, the Gauchos have their own slew of hitters that make them dangerous on any given day.</p>\n<p>They are led by sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (26) and is second in hits (35), and slugging percentage (.466). Redshirt junior outfielder Andrew Calica leads the team in hits (37) ranks second in on base percentage (.477) and fourth in batting average (.291).</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomores JJ Muno, a second baseman, and Josh Adams, designated hitter, both lead the team in home runs with four each. Adams also ranks second in RBI with a solid 23 on the season.</p>\n<p>A player who has also come on as of late is redshirt junior Devon Gradford who now leads the team in batting average (.387) and slugging percentage (.486).</p>\n<p>This weekday game will look to be a bounce back for the Gauchos. Although they are still having a solid season, being swept is never an easy thing to bounce back from especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>One problem  facing Santa Barbara this game and the entire season is the fact that they are on the road. Currently the Gauchos are 5-9-1 away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium and have lost four of their last six on the road.</p>\n<p>This game against the Gaels is important to see not only how UCSB will respond to its three-game losing streak, longest of the season, and how it can try to avenge its loss to the Gaels earlier this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end their four-game road stand against St. Mary’s on today at 3 p.m. at Louis Guisto Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Naloxone is a medication that temporarily blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and keeps the opioid from being able to attach to those receptors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the training, free Naloxone nasal spray kits were handed out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>About 45 students and community members were present at the first training on Tuesday. The second training will be held on Thursday, April 4 at 7 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The start of the trainings follows a public health announcement sent out by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead on March 20. The announcement said that in the past few weeks, “three Isla Vista residents suffered from an apparent overdose of opioids,” and while two were revived with the use of Naloxone, the third did not survive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>UCSB’s Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada later clarified to the <em>Nexus </em>that the overdose resulting in death did not occur in I.V. , and the individual was not an I.V.  resident, as had been stated in the announcement sent out to all UCSB students.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The trainings, however, were not held as a result of the most recent overdoses, according to Angie Bryan, the recovery program manager and a recovery specialist for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program. In fact, planning for the trainings has been in the works for a little over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan first proposed an overdose prevention protocol to Student Health during March 2018, and the standing order was approved by the director of behavioral health in October of 2018, Bryan said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan was approved for a Naloxone grant through the California Department of Public Health’s Naloxone Distribution Project in November 2018, and received a supply of Naloxone in December 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan led Tuesday’s Naloxone training in the I.V. Community Room.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve been a counselor at UCSB for almost 15 years,” Bryan said at the beginning of the training. “Naloxone is something I’m really passionate about in terms of making sure that we get it into as many hands and homes as possible because I think it’s important for students to feel empowered to do something.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Students are the ones that are gonna be there in those first moments that an overdose might happen.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan discussed preventative measures that students could take, such as using fentanyl test strips and various drug testing kits that can test for a range of substances, along with how to reduce the risk of using certain substances.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She then asked attendees for what they think signs of an overdose are, to which attendees responded with an individual being unresponsive, having pinpoint pupils and having discoloration of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But even after Naloxone is administered, 911 still needs to be called, Bryan explained.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan demonstrated the use of Naloxone by asking an attendee to volunteer to lie on the ground acting as an individual who overdosed. She then went through the hypothetical motions of using the nasal spray on the volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan said that all law enforcement officers and paramedics in I.V. carry Naloxone, including UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol, and emphasized that a person who calls law enforcement in response to an overdose cannot be charged with a misdemeanor crime of possession or being under the influence.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, that is not the case for felony-type charges, Bryan said. For example, if one has an excessive amount of drugs that seems like an intent to sell, law enforcement could investigate that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jeike Meijer, the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), collaborated with Bryan on the trainings after Bryan received the Naloxone grant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“We sat down, we had a meeting, we kind of tried to think about when would be the best time to have [the trainings], and we thought before Deltopia was the best,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer said preparing students for overdose situations as opposed to just discouraging drug use is a more effective route for keeping students safe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s really important to not just say ‘don’t do drugs,’ because people will do it, and it’s good to know how to be safe in the case of an emergency,” Meijer said. “Even if you don’t think that you’ll be using opioids, you might have a neighbor, or a housemate [who does].”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer added that the public health announcement sent out to UCSB students which mentioned the recent opioid overdoses reiterates the necessity of Naloxone trainings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m hoping that conversations and de-stigmatization… will allow people to get the help they need.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Along with Bryan, Meijer also hopes to help with more Naloxone trainings in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Angie had all of the information and all of the knowledge to bring,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s always people working on projects and there’s always someone who’s going to know more than you, and you have to know when to step back and let them take the wheel but give them all of the power you have,” Meijer said. “I don’t know how to do the trainings, but I can give the space.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
