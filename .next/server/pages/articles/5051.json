We each made mistakes but we were also able to make some great things happen.”</p>\n<p>After a back and forth battle in which neither team was able to pull away, the two sides found themselves deadlocked heading into overtime.</p>\n<p>“We played hard and smart the entire game,” Porter said. “After the buzzer sounded at the end of the fourth, we came into the wall and all agreed we weren’t going to end the season with a loss.”</p>\n<p>The game remained extremely tight until the very end, but UCSB eventually got the win that it wanted, holding on for an 11-10 victory.</p>\n<p>“We were able to pull away with a win because we came together as a team,” Porter said. “We refused to give up, and fortunately for us our offense and defense worked really well together in overtime.”</p>\n<p>Two days earlier, the Gauchos came into their first game of the weekend against Long Beach looking to avenge a 9-5 loss earlier this month.</p>\n<p>“Going into the game we were very excited to play them again,” Porter said. “[They] came into the game knowing we were going to give them a fight.”</p>\n<p>Things looked good early on with sophomore utility Samantha Murphy taking advantage of a 6-on-5 to give UCSB a 1-0 lead. However, quick goals from senior defender Coriann Snyder and senior attacker Chelsea Parks gave the 49ers a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Sophomore attacker Miranda Schrader gave the Gauchos their second goal of the day on another 6-on-5 situation to tie it at two goals apiece, but Long Beach quickly took the lead again and did not relinquish it for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>A second straight four-goal quarter sent the 49ers to halftime with an 8-4 advantage with Parks and junior attacker Justine Morgan leading the way. Parks eventually finished the day with four goals and Morgan contributed a hat trick of her own.</p>\n<p>As UCSB headed into the second half needing something to change, it looked to its defense to spark some momentum. However, the part of the Gauchos’ game that had been its biggest strength down the final stretch of the season became a problem when they needed it most.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest weakness was our defense,” Porter said. “We tried to switch it up in the second half to something we barely practice. When that didn’t seem to work I think the team began to get really frustrated which affected our offense.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach opened the second half with three goals to push the lead to 11-4, putting the game out of reach. The 49ers eventually cruised to a 12-7 win.</p>\n<p>Senior utility Jade Wentz Fitzgerald led the Gauchos with two goals and sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw led the defense with three saves.</p>\n<p>With the season now officially over, UCSB has ten days off before it starts preparations for next season.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to work even harder than we did during this season to get better as a team,” Porter said. “We do have a lot of work to do and it’s going to take a lot of hard work and dedication, but I know we’re very capable of coming back even stronger next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily

Pepperdine hosts UCSB with an overall record of 11-12 and is currently 1-6 in conference play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If Pepperdine beats UCI on Friday and goes on to beat Santa Barbara by at least two goals, then they will have a good chance of taking the tiebreaker and the sixth seed, making this a crucial game for both teams.</p>\n<p>“We are in a really great position.” Senior attacker Derek Shoemaker said. “We feel confident we can get that win and have a good standing for the MPSF tournament.”</p>\n<p>These two teams are no strangers, as Saturday’s game will mark the third matchup between them this season. UCSB has been the victor in both meetings, but not by much.</p>\n<p>At the NorCal Tournament in September, the Gauchos narrowly defeated the Waves by just one goal in overtime. The two teams met again at Pepperdine just four days later, during which UCSB again came away with a slim victory, this time by two goals.</p>\n<p>“Pepperdine will be tough.” Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge said. “We’ve won two games against them already so they will be extra fired up to get one against us.”</p>\n<p>No doubt Pepperdine will put up a great fight, as it has in the last two matchups, thanks to freshman Marko Asic. The young utility leads the team in goals scored with 37.</p>\n<p>Alongside him is senior attacker Wesley Sherburne, who has 33 goals, three of which he scored against UCSB in the teams’ second matchup. Sophomore goalkeeper Zack Rhodes has also played a key role with his 228 saves on the season.</p>\n<p>As the final week approaches, Santa Barbara knows it will be able to count on its four star seniors to lead it to victory. Senior two-meter Liam Gaughan has done big things against the Waves, scoring five goals against them this season. Two-meter Nick Jordan will look to continue with his timely shooting and maintain his shooting percentage of 42.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos get help from a lot of players, but the two stars who have led the team all season are (don’t add year and position for these names) Derek Shoemaker and Chris Whitelegge. The team’s leading goal scorer with 39, Shoemaker has scored seven goals against Pepperdine this year.</p>\n<p>As for the star goalkeeper, Whitelegge will look to keep moving up in the MPSF record books in career saves. He has played exceptionally well against Pepperdine, registering 28 saves in the two matchups, including a season high 15 in the second match alone.</p>\n<p>“They like to shoot,” Whitelegge said. “They are going to fire away and really try to take the game to us. We have to stand against that.”</p>\n<p>The final regular season match will have huge significance for the No. 6 team in the country. The Gauchos are in control of their own destiny at this point, a position that every team hopes to be in this late in the season.</p>\n<p>“This is where we want to be.” Wigo said. “This was one of the goals coming into the season and we are there now, we just have to play well and everything will work itself out.”</p>\n<p>It will be an emotional match for both teams, as a handful of seniors will be playing their final regular season game. The stakes are high with the No. 6 seed in the MPSF Tournament on the line, as seeds 7-10 will have to play a tie-in game to advance to the next round.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Pepperdine will show why they will be forces to be reckoned with as the MPSF championships quickly approach.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ final regular season match will be played on Saturday at Pepperdine at 12 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They definitely had us beat in some positions with some size and that’s why you’ve got to take speed and quickness and beat them that way. We weren’t efficient enough.”</p>\n<p>The road trip to Santa Barbara was the Rainbow Wahine’s last match of the season. This year’s Big West Champions, Hawai’i finished with an undefeated conference record of 16-0 and will enter the NCAA Tournament with a 26-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>It will also enter the postseason with a 21-match win streak, its longest since winning 26-straight in 2011. Hawaii’s win over UCSB in straight sets was its third consecutive sweep of a team and its 16<sup>th</sup> sweep of the season.</p>\n<p>With great size, not only did Hawai’i dominate at the net but it also had a powerful attack. The Rainbow Wahine established an aggressive swing on the ball early in the match, recording a .393 hitting clip in the first set.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara showed signs of being able to defend Hawaii’s attack as it trailed 4-5. However, it was up until this point that Hawaii’s 5-0 run would increase its lead to 10-4, forcing a UCSB timeout. The Rainbow Wahine’s largest lead was 11 points and eventually resulted in them taking a 1-0 lead with a 25-16 win in the first set.</p>\n<p>Leading Hawai’i on the offensive end was junior opposite Nikki Taylor. Although she tallied a match-high 11 kills, she finished with a .111 hitting percentage, her third lowest in a match this season.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did some really good things out there,” Lantagne Welch said. “We passed well, we had a few big hitters. We held their best player [Taylor], she struggled tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to contain Taylor was most effective in the second set as it held Hawai’i to a .069 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Still, a -.156 hitting percentage and 12 errors plagued Santa Barbara in the set, allowing Hawai’i to capitalize on the Gauchos’ mistakes to take a 6-0 lead. Able to extend their lead to 20-9, it seemed like the Rainbow Wahine were destined to earn a blowout set victory.</p>\n<p>Despite the 11-point deficit, the Gauchos responded with a 6-2 run to trim Hawaii’s lead to 22-15. Senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva finished with a team-high seven kills. In spite of UCSB’s comeback effort, Hawai’i built upon its lead with a kill by Taylor and a block to earn the set-point lead at 24-15.</p>\n<p>But a 5-0 scoring run helped Santa Barbara to delay Hawaii’s pursuit of taking a 2-0 lead, causing the Rainbow Wahine to call a timeout. However, another kill by Taylor and a block by sophomore middle blocker Emily Maglio and sophomore setter Kendra Koelsch secured Hawaii’s 25-21 win.</p>\n<p>Another commanding start highlighted the Rainbow Wahine’s opening of the third set as they took an 8-2 lead, leading to a Gauchos’ timeout. While both teams traded points, UCSB could never overcome Hawaii’s lead and were forced to call a second timeout while down by a score of 13-20.</p>\n<p>Helping spark Santa Barbara’s last chance at avoiding being swept was freshman outside hitter Devin Joos as her kill ignited the Gauchos’ 5-0 run to cut Hawaii’s lead to three at 18-21. Joos and junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt both registered six kills and both recorded a .308 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>However, the momentum remained with Hawai’i as it needed four points to end the match. Earning these last four points was no challenge as the Rainbow Wahine ended the third set with a .500 hitting percentage to take the 25-19 win to close the match.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will end its season on Tuesday, Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> as it will face UC Irvine at 7:00 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66702\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66702\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/gauchos-unable-to-spoil-undefeated-conf-record-of-no-8-hawaii-at-uci-for-season-finale/","id":5049,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5048,5047,5046],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB to Host 51st Annual Asics Invitational, Slate of Non-Conference Opponents Awaits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_021-FILEPHOTO-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_021-FILEPHOTO-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After a huge 3-1 road victory over reigning national champion Loyola (Illinois) last Sunday, the UCSB men's volleyball team looks to use it momentum in its home opener.

In its contest the next day, Santa Barbara defeated reigning champions Loyola by the same score.</p>\n<p>The players are looking forward to playing against another set of tough teams following their visits to Loyola and Lewis and continue to adjust to life without last year’s senior class, led by Kevin Donohue and Weston Nielsen. The two were first and second, respectively in kills, tallying totals of 331 and 238 apiece.</p>\n<p>“We want to win all three games, but the main objective is getting better,” junior outside hitter Jacob Delson said. “The more touches we have on the ball and the more time we spend together as a team, the better we will be for season.”</p>\n<p>Delson is returning as one of the leaders for this season’s squad. He totaled the third most kills with 214 last year, the most among returning players. In two matches this year, he is averaging 15.0 kills and 5.5 digs.</p>\n<p>Despite losing several key seniors, UCSB will be led by Delson, redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh, and senior setter Jonah Seif. Marsh, in the first two matches this season, is second on the team with 24 kills. Seif was named to the AVCA All-American Second Team last year, tallying 967 assists, and is off to a similar start this year with 76 in two games.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, a lot of guys will see the floor this weekend,” McLaughlin said. “Our program is a constant competitive environment and it could always be a different team out there from one week to the next.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were ranked no. 9 in last year’s Coaches Poll, and with a lineup that McLaughlin says is “very capable of taking the floor and being successful,” they are confident that they can finish atop the rankings come May.</p>\n<p>“Your goal, always, is to be number one,” McLaughlin said. “That’s what the team’s shooting for and I think we’ve got a shot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s quest for the national crown continues in Rob Gym with a Friday doubleheader on Jan. 8 against Quincy at 10:00 a.m. and NJIT at 7:00 p.m. The Gauchos’ busy week ends with their matchup versus Sacred Heart on Saturday, Jan. 9 at 6:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67219\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67219\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/ucsb-to-host-51st-annual-asics-invitational-slate-of-non-conference-opponents-awaits/","id":5050,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5049,5048,5047],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
