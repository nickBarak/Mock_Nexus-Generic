At the end of the day, it was the rebounding side of things.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine improve to 16-11 and 10-5 in the Big West, moving into a tie for second place with Cal Poly. UCSB on the other hand, falls to 8-20 overall and 3-12 in conference.</p>\n<p>With Riverside losing to UC Davis last night, the Gauchos continue to hold onto the eighth and final playoff spot by a one-game margin.</p>\n<p>Tied at 13 all with 11:43 to go in the first half, the Rainbow Wahine went on an 11-0 run sparked by offensive boards. With 11 offensive rebounds in the first half, four of those 11 points were scored on rebound putbacks. Control of the game remained in Hawaii’s hands the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a lot of miscommunications on defense, but the main reason (for their run) was the rebounding,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We played zone most of the game and I think we had problems finding people to box out.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii continued to stand up to its ranking as the top defensive team in the Big West, holding UCSB to just 21 points in the first half. The Rainbow Wahine also lead the league in rebounding margin, which they exemplified tonight, outrebounding UCSB 22-10 in the first half, creating the separation that would last the entirety of the contest.</p>\n<p>With leading scorer and rebounder Kamilah Martin on the bench due to injury, other players stepped up offensively for the Rainbow Wahine. Four players finished in double figures with senior forward Diane Moore and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana leading Hawaii with 17 points apiece, which is a career-high for Moore.</p>\n<p>“They’ve played four games without [Jackson], so it’s not like this was their first game,” Mitchell said. “Because of their style of play, they’re not making any major adjustments. They do such a great job of having a balanced attack, so they don’t just rely on one player.”</p>\n<p>The biggest bright spot to take away from last night’s game for UCSB was the play of Zornig, who tallied a game- and career-high 28 points and six rebounds on 11-20 shooting.</p>\n<p>“She was just aggressive and took good shots,” Mitchell said. “She was able to attack off of the dribble and has played that way the entire year. I’m extremely proud of her and her growth and maturity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fly home today and will need to prepare quickly for Cal Poly Saturday for senior day. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

The current Big West Player of the Week finished with 29 points, 16 rebounds and four assists despite FGCU playing tough defense and using multiple defenders to guard him.</p>\n<p>Junior guard John Green came off the bench and was the second-leading scorer on the night for Santa Barbara with 17 points. Green was effective on both sides of the court, making big buckets and drawing offensive fouls on defense before fouling out.</p>\n<p>The game was tight for most of the second half with both sides sharing the lead. FGCU began the half looking to extend its 32-28 first half advantage and were effective coming out of the half. Yet, the Gauchos went on a 7-0 run to close the gap after junior guard Michael Bryson knocked down a corner three-pointer on a skip pass from Williams.</p>\n<p>From there on, the Gauchos clamped down defensively and closed down driving lanes to set up the close finish before going into overtime with the score tied at 64.</p>\n<p>It was in overtime where the Eagles began taking control of the game. FGCU took advantage of fouls committed by UCSB and converted from the charity stripe to gain separation. With 27 seconds left to play, the Eagles were winning 77-74 after a made free throw by sophomore guard Eric Childress. Despite the attempted comeback, the rally fell short as FGCU made its free throw attempts and controlled the boards in the period.</p>\n<p>Williams was limited to only one basket in OT as the big man played with more caution after picking up his fourth foul. Foul trouble, as in the previous game, plagued the Gauchos. Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent were forced to sit parts of the game after getting into early foul trouble.</p>\n<p>Another area concern for the Gauchos was in the three-point shooting category. Santa Barbara shot only 22 percent from behind the arc, going a total of 5-23 on the night.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, senior guard Brett Comer was just as dynamic as Williams on the offensive end, finishing with 28 points to lead the Eagles.</p>\n<p>After two games on the road to start the season, UCSB returns home for its first regular season matchup at the Thunderdome. The team will face The Master’s College on Saturday as it looks to get back into the win column.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>However, this season was very different in what was a season of struggle for the Gauchos. Finishing the year at just 8-22 overall and 3-13 in conference play, Santa Barbara barely qualified for the Big West Tournament, losing to UC Davis in the first round.</p>\n<p>In that loss, UCSB’s seniors scored every point in the second-half comeback. Losing its entire starting backcourt to graduation, the Gauchos will miss the majority of its scoring as senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason accounted for 64.3 percent of the team’s offense.</p>\n<p>All three averaged double-digit scoring for Santa Barbara and were the only players to do so. Nesbit and Zornig both hit the 1,000-point career milestone this season and were named All-Big West Honorable Mention selections.</p>\n<p>“They understand that they’re not going to be remembered by their last record. All of them left here better players,” Mitchell said. “All have signed with agents and will have a chance to play in Europe.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Santa Barbara does return seven players. In fact, its two returning starters are at the two positions most difficult to replace. Next season, freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe will return as a sophomore after being named to the Big West All-Freshmen team this season and averaging 5.8 points and 2.2 assists while running the show for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Playing center, junior Clair Watkins will play her first full season with the Gauchos after joining the team in December this season. Watkins found her stride toward the end of the year, averaging 8.6 points and 8.4 rebounds in the last seven games.</p>\n<p>Along with junior guard Kristine Brance, Watkins will be expected to be the leader of next year’s squad.</p>\n<p>“I think our upperclassmen have had a great postseason and have worked harder than any group in my three years here,” Mitchell said. “Some of that you can talk up to the bitter taste we had in our mouth. Now they realize you have three senior guards leaving and someone has to step up. I’ve told Clair she has the ability to be one of the best post players in the conference. When she’s willing to step up and carry that burden, then we’ll be a big-time team.”</p>\n<p>While Mitchell looks to replace the offense lost from the graduating seniors with this year’s recruits, the focus will return to the defensive end. This season, the Gauchos scored more points than any team during Mitchell’s reign, but also gave up the most points of any of her past teams.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to go back to being that really mean, tough, defensive team,” Mitchell said. “I think a combination of us trying to prove we could score 70 points a game this season … somehow we didn’t have the mindset or mentality to put away close games. So you know a lot of that will be put on my shoulders to make sure out team knows what our identity will look like, but I don’t think it will be hard to convince them after our record this year.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, in recruiting, Mitchell looked for versatile players while looking to add height to the roster.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for versatility and more of a physical presence body-wise. At the end of the day, most of the time it was on the defensive end we had a hard time matching up with people because of our lack of size,” Mitchell said. “At the championship level or when you get to March, it’s about grinding it out in the half court, both offensively and defensively. All play for great programs and they know what it takes to win. That’s, to me, the biggest thing.”</p>\n<p>This year’s recruiting class includes guard Dioseline Lopez, guard/forward Chaya Durr, guard Makala Roper, guard Taylor Farris and forward/center Sabrina Callahan.</p>\n<p><strong>Dioseline Lopez</strong></p>\n<p>Mitchell’s newest recruit, Lopez, is a 5’6” guard transferring from East Los Angeles College. Averaging 14.3 points per game and leading the South Coast Conference in assists, rebounds and steals with 7.4, 4.3 and 2.3 per game, respectively, Lopez was named SCC North Division Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Lopez was also named to the All-SCC North First Team for the second time and the California Community College Athletic Association All-State Third Team.</p>\n<p>“It only took me watching film on Dee to see that swag she has. She was able to play with our kids, and right away they were begging us to take her,” Mitchell said. “She’s a true point guard, but like Nic, has the ability to score a lot. I think [she] will relieve some of the pressure from Onome thinking that she has to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>Lopez brings more depth to the point guard position, but can also serve as a scoring threat for UCSB. Leading her team to the second round of the CCCAA Southern California playoffs, she scored 33 points and six assists in a tight 92-88 overtime loss.</p>\n<p>“She’ll run the show, she’ll facilitate, but if we need her to score, she has that ability,” Mitchell said. “She has toughness. She hasn’t had the easiest path to get here, and that’s okay with me because she has that fire to prove to everyone she can play at this level.”</p>\n<p><strong>Chaya Durr</strong></p>\n<p>Durr missed her senior season at Sacramento High School with an ACL tear, but should be 100 percent ready to go in August or September. She will join teammate Jasmine Ware as the second Sac High Lady Dragon on the Gaucho roster.</p>\n<p>“I have no problem saying it: We would’ve never signed her if she hadn’t have torn her ACL,” Mitchell said. “But I’m not worried about her missing her senior year of high school. We know what she’s capable of.”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard or forward position and listed at 5’11”, Durr averaged a double-double during her junior year with 18 points and 12 rebounds per contest. She also tallied 4.0 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. As a result, Durr was named all-city and an all-league first team member.</p>\n<p>“She’s a big-time athlete, very passionate and can make a huge difference on the [boards],” Mitchell said. “Defensively, she’s one of those that, if we want to press — and if you saw the team our last game of the year against Davis, that’s the style that will fit Chaya and help us have more of an up-tempo look.”</p>\n<p><strong>Makala Roper</strong></p>\n<p>A combination guard from Cleveland High School in Seattle, 5’8” Roper earned 3A Player of the Year honors this year after helping her team win the Class 3A State Girls Basketball title as both a junior and senior. Roper was honored with the MVP trophy of the Class 3A All-Tournament Team as well.</p>\n<p>“She’s a lefty and a deadly shooter,” Mitchell said. “She could play a little bit of point because she has great handles and even though she puts up big numbers and has the reputation of being a scorer, we know she’s a great passer and facilitator.”</p>\n<p>Leading her team to an undefeated 16-0 conference record, the player her teammates call “Sniper” averaged 16.3 points per game her senior year. In addition, according to MaxPreps, Roper is the top-ranked player in Washington.</p>\n<p>“She’ll be able to play the scoring position,” Mitchell said. “Losing Mel Zornig, she should give us that three-point shooter that we have graduating.”</p>\n<p><strong>Taylor Farris</strong></p>\n<p>Farris joins the Gauchos from Renton, Washington. Listed at 5’11”, Farris was named the League MVP as a junior. The same year, she led Renton High to third place, its best finish in the 2A State Tournament since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Taylor Farris is a long athlete,” Mitchell said. “She’s better around the basket and the rim. She works well in tight quarters and has great timing. ”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard position, Farris averaged 20.9 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 7.3 steals and 4.1 blocks her senior season.</p>\n<p>“She played at a smaller high school, but played for one of the top AAU programs, so we have no question she can come right in with her length — she gets tons of deflections,” Mitchell said. “Her comfort level may be the four right now because she’s great from the high post, but at some point, she shoots it well enough she’ll be able to move out to a perimeter position for us.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sabrina Callahan</strong></p>\n<p>Playing at forward or center at one of the women’s basketball powerhouses in Southern California, La Jolla Country Day School, Callahan averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.9 blocks per game. At 6’0”, she also shot 51 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“From day one, I told my staff I wanted a kid that played for Terri Bamford. She’s that good and that respected at La Jolla Country Day,” Mitchell said. “Her kids typically play with her all through their AAU program also, so they’re well-coached and understand the skills.”</p>\n<p>This season, Callahan earned All-San Diego Section second team honors.</p>\n<p>“Sabrina understands all the little things it takes to win, whether it’s screening, being a great passer, and a lot of times she’s the one out there directing traffic on the floor from the four position,” Mitchell said. “She gives us size, she gives us versatility and at some point she’ll move over to the wing position as well.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will begin its season in November.

Hawaii currently holds the third seed in the Big West at 15-11 overall and 9-5 in conference. For UCSB, a win would go a long way in securing the eighth seed and ensuring it controls its own destiny.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying not to think about [the playoffs],” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We’re just trying to play one game at a time and focus on us. We’re focused on our next game: going to Hawaii and beating them at their place.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii holds the biggest home court advantage in the league with a five-and-a-half hour flight and a two-hour time zone difference separating it from every other Big West team. The Rainbow Wahine are 10-3 at home, including 6-1 during Big West play, with their only home loss coming to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB knows the feeling of victory in Hawaii, defeating the Rainbow Wahine last season on their home court.</p>\n<p>Earlier this season, Santa Barbara nearly came away with the victory in Thunderdome, falling 63-60. Hawaii shot 22-24 from the free throw line, including 19-20 in the second half, compared to 3-6 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Even then, UCSB held a lead in the final period until the Rainbow Wahine went to star senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who scored six straight points to give Hawaii a three-point lead with under a minute to go.</p>\n<p>“[From that game, we take] learning how to close games out,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’re pretty good for long stretches, but it came down to the last four minutes where a couple things fell apart. We have to learn how to win.”</p>\n<p>Jackson continues to lead Hawaii offensively, averaging 15.5 points and 9.7 rebounds while shooting 50.4 percent from the field. However, Jackson has not played in the last four games after suffering a foot injury against UC Riverside Feb. 13. It is unknown whether she will suit up tonight.</p>\n<p>In Jackson’s absence, the Rainbow Wahine have still been solid, going 3-1. Stepping up have been senior guard Shawna-Lei Keuhu, who leads the team in scoring during conference play with 12.2 points per game and scored a team-high 15 points in the Thunderdome, and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana, who averages 10.2 points per game. A big, physical team known for playing four power forwards and a point guard, Hawaii has plenty of options.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious they’ve found other players to step up and they’re winning without [Jackson],” Mitchell said. “She is a big-time player, but you can’t just focus on her. It won’t change our game plan at all [if she doesn’t play].”</p>\n<p>On the other end, the big emerging player for UCSB has been junior center Clair Watkins, who is a very different player than when Hawaii last saw her. In her last three games, Watkins has averaged a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Clair’s] major,” Mitchell said. “I know that. She knows that. We need her to get the paint and score.”</p>\n<p>Yet don’t expect an offensive battle tonight as both teams are very defensive minded. Under Mitchell, the Gauchos have been a team that prides itself on its defense and the Rainbow Wahine currently lead the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 60.7 points during conference play.</p>\n<p>“First of all, [the fact that they’re in first] frustrates me because that should be us and it was us in the past,” Mitchell said. “They’re big, they’re strong and they’re physical. I tell our team, ‘it’s a compliment — they play like old ladies.’ They don’t beat themselves. They make the right decisions, and they do all the blue-collar things that allow them to be where they’re at in the conference standings.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 9 p.m. Pacific Time at Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/","id":510,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[509,508,507],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
