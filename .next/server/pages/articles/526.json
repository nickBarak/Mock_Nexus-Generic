More recently, Los Angeles won three-straight titles in 2000-02 behind one of the best duos in NBA history in Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Bulls have also known the glory of the three-peat twice, accomplishing it in 1991-93 and 1996-98. Chicago, of course, was led by arguably the best player to ever play the game of basketball, Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>The team standing above all however, is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics utterly dominated the basketball world in the sixties, winning eight championships in a row and 11 in 13 years from 1957-69. The master behind the success? A 6’10’’ center by the name of Bill Russell.</p>\n<p>Russell, who is underrated when it comes to listing the best players of all time, holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls, the Heat features one of the best players to ever grace a basketball court and certainly the best player currently playing the game right now: LeBron James. Miami also features the “Big Three” in James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, which has captivated audiences all over the world.</p>\n<p>The Heat’s fast-paced, flashy play and incredible talent make them one of the most entertaining teams of all time if nothing else. They also play at a time where the level of competition around the league is much higher (excluding the Eastern Conference this season).</p>\n<p>Every year now, there are a handful of teams fighting for the NBA Championship rather than just a couple teams that were powerhouses decades ago. It does make the idea of a three-peat seem even more remarkable.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when it all comes down to it, it’s all about the rings. Boston leads the NBA in championships with an incredible 17 titles. The Lakers don’t rank far behind with 16.</p>\n<p>Considering that a sports dynasty is defined as “a team that dominates its sport or league for an extraordinary length of time,” these are the two teams that should be considered dynasties.</p>\n<p>They’re always in the hunt and rarely have off years. They’re the teams everyone wants to be a part of because there’s always a good chance to make history.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Lakers and Celtics are the best teams in NBA history. Period.</p>\n<p>With that said, Chicago would have to come next on the list for ranking of the best team with six crowns, all coming in the electrifying era that was Jordan.</p>\n<p>The Jordan Era made Chicago a destination for great players and a city that desired greatness in the basketball world. Nevertheless, the Bulls are still looking for that next group to bring home more rings and give the Bulls multiple eras of greatness.</p>\n<p>As for Miami, which currently owns three championships, another title would bring the Heat’s total to four, tying it for fourth-most crowns in NBA history with San Antonio.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Miami will go down as one of the most elite franchises in the NBA if it can three-peat in June, but four franchise championships is a long way off from 17, 16 or even six crowns.<br>\nAnd considering that the number of championships determines your worth, the Heat still have a long way to go if it wants to move up in the ranking for best team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Cavaliers have now won the number one overall pick two years in a row and in three out of the last four years. On top of that, they had the fourth pick in both 2011 and 2012. To put it simply, if the Cavs start the player that they get in this year’s draft, their entire first unit would be made up of top-five athletes.</p>\n<p>So, besides the rest of the NBA being bent over from this lottery outcome, what does this pick mean? It means the Cavs have another chance to either grab a good player like Kyrie Irving, or completely embarrass themselves again.</p>\n<p>I’m sure we all remember the players they passed up in recent years such as Damian Lillard, Andre Drummond, Kemba Walker and Klay Thompson, just to name a few. Instead, the team lucked out and drafted the incredible Tristan Thompson and amazing Anthony Bennett. Along with those great moves, they signed/dropped Andrew Bynum and traded big for Luol Deng, who is now a free agent. All while failing to make theplayoffs since King James left.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lucky enough for the Cavs, this draft is possibly more stacked than the 2003 draft which consisted of Miami’s big three and Carmelo Anthony. What this means is that if Cleveland decides to keep its pick, it will be pretty hard to take another bust with all these promising young players to choose from.</p>\n<p>Everyone from random enthusiasts to big time analysts are saying that the number one overall pick in this draft will be Kansas’s Andrew Wiggins, but in my opinion, that’s their third best option.</p>\n<p>Wiggins is a good player without a doubt, but his subpar college performance showed his youth and inexperience at the next level. In addition to that, he isn’t the greatest fit into the system of the Cavaliers, especially if Deng were to stay.</p>\n<p>The team’s second best option would be to take Joel Embiid or Jabari Parker. The Cavs struggle at both the SF and C positions on both sides of the ball. Parker would help offensively, which the team needs as it was 22nd in scoring last year, but he could be a burden on defense.</p>\n<p>Embiid could prove to be a huge help on defense as long as the seven-footer works on his speed a bit. He averaged 2.6 blocks last year and played excellent post defense to go with it. Joel is the best pick for the Cavs if they decide to draft, but trading this pick would truly be the most effective.</p>\n<p>Minnesota knows Kevin Love is leaving next year and they’re looking for a deal. The Cavs could consider bundling the pick and possibly Dion Waiters to bring in K-Love, which would surely draw Deng back in as well. Kyrie, Deng, Love, and two top picks sound good to me. Maybe that will break the King James curse.</p>\n<p>Now, it is annoying that Cleveland received the top pick again, but with the talent in this draft, other teams shouldn’t hang their heads by any means. In fact, the team that should be the most excited is the Philadelphia 76ers, who have the third pick.</p>\n<p>With the two Jayhawks probably going first, Philly will likely have the option of Coach K’s Jabari Parker, who can easily complement the team. He would join reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams (another player whom Cleveland passed up) and Nerlens Noel, who will make his real debut this year. This young combination will ensure they never have another terrible slide like they did in the second half of last season.</p>\n<p>Another pair of teams that can strive if they play their cards right are the Lakers and Celtics. These two rivals can work together to make a blockbuster trade with their 6th and 7th picks. The Celtics could help build their franchise by adding a veteran in like Kevin Love in exchange for their pick as well as dish Rajon Rondo to the Lakers for their pick.</p>\n<p>The Celtics would receive an all-star and likely draft Marcus Smart and the Lakers would receive Rondo who helps them in their “win now” situation. With Kobe being re-signed, it’s clear they aren’t trying to build with an incoming rookie. If neither team were to trade, they could still be looking at drafting Aaron Gordon, Julius Randle and Smart, who would best fit both teams.</p>\n<p>The team that undoubtedly got burned the most was the Detroit Pistons. In a trade with the Bobcats a few years ago, Detroit received a minimally protected first round pick in this year’s draft. This meant that if the Pistons got a top-eight pick, they could keep it for themselves, and if they didn’t, it would belong to Charlotte. The Pistons received the 9th pick on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>This draft will definitely be one for the league to remember and although things may seem bad for your team now, don’t worry yourself in the slightest. This is the NBA Draft — we never know what insanity is going to unfold.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of </em>www.sportslogos.net<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/","id":523,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[522,521,520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Heat Superstar-Trio Still Has Lots to Prove","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Mark Salay discusses why the Heat don't measure up with the NBA's greatest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Eight wins.

With three titles, that puts them in the same playing field as Kobe and Shaq’s Lakers, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker’s Spurs and Larry Bird’s great Celtics teams. Those teams won three titles each.</p>\n<p>However, for the Heat to enter the upper echelon of dynasties would mean equating them with teams that revolutionized the game. Bill Russell’s Celtics, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Lakers and Michael Jordan’s Bulls all fall under this elite category. The Minneapolis Lakers of the early 1950s led by George Mikan also deserves a spot in this class.</p>\n<p>Consider that these teams all won at least four titles, played against formidable competition and dominated the game.</p>\n<p>Jordan three-peated twice and if he hadn’t decided to take a two-year break from the game, the Bulls would most likely have won eight straight titles.</p>\n<p>Not only did Chicago win each time they reached the Finals, none of the series were pushed to a game seven. LeBron and Co. lost in their first appearance and if it wasn’t for an incredibly clutch three-point shot from</p>\n<p>Ray Allen, last year’s Finals wouldn’t even have gone to a deciding game seven.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the topic of who Miami has faced in the championship round. In 2012, the Heat played against a young and inexperienced Oklahoma City squad that was not ready to take the crown just yet.</p>\n<p>Last year, a game seven proved to be too much for an aging Spurs team. Going against Kevin Durant before this year or Duncan past his prime does not cut it when talking about all-time great dynasties.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Showtime Lakers had to go through the legendary Celtics teams led by Bird. Those games pitted two opponents who had the same caliber of talent and saved the NBA from going extinct. The</p>\n<p>Johnson-Bird rivalry increased interest of the NBA and brought a new generation of fans to the game.</p>\n<p>Russell had his own rival in Wilt Chamberlain and Jordan went toe-to-toe with the two-headed monster of Karl Malone and John Stockton twice. James is the best player in the league, but there is no equivalent for him to prove his mettle.</p>\n<p>The Heat are also not on par with the dominance achieved with teams that came before. Minneapolis, the league’s first dynasty, won five championships in six years. Boston failed to win a title just once during the 1960s. That ladies and gentlemen, is dominance. The Heat are good, but not that good.</p>\n<p>And if you had to pick one coach to draw up the last play with the game on the line, would you have Erik Spoelstra design the play, or hand things over to Red Auerbach or Phil Jackson? The championship rings on those coach’s fingers can answer that question. Auerbach won nine times and Jackson ran out of fingers to show off his rings.</p>\n<p>If the Heat win it this year they deserve to be ranked higher than other mini-dynasties such as the Houston Rockets of the mid 1990s or the Detroit Pistons of the Bad Boy era. Their name probably is on the same plateau as Bird’s Celtics and Kobe and Shaq’s L.A. teams. However, to enter legendary status and be considered the greatest, Miami will have to win, “not three, not four, not six, not seven.” Only time will tell if that happens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A

season this past weekend at the hands of No. 4 USC on the road and No. 6 Long Beach State at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got blown out by the Trojans 14-5 on Saturday afternoon in a game where UCSB couldn’t amass much offense against a stubborn USC team. The Gauchos started the game with a goal from senior utility Chase Racich early in the first quarter, but USC then took control and never let go, with three goals in the first quarter followed by six in the second to give the Trojans a 9-2 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was a close battle as the Gauchos held the Trojans to only two goals while scoring two of their own from junior attacker Bryan Snyder and junior attacker Kevin Cappon, his second of the game. The game ended 14-5 after a goal from freshman attacker Josh Jordan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos weren’t able to make up for their loss the prior day as UCSB fell to Long Beach St. 14-12 in another close game between the two evenly matched teams. Their previous encounter saw the Gauchos win in sudden death overtime 14-13, but they weren’t able to pull through yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“For me I think we lost the game in the first half,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We gave up two or three really easy goals to them. One was a rebound goal that we should have boxed out and got the rebound, and then another one we were trying to get out of the half and we committed an offensive foul to give them a big opportunity.”</p>\n<p>After Long Beach went up 1-0, the Gauchos countered with a goal from Cappon before the 49ers ended the first quarter up 4-2. Both teams scored five goals apiece in the second quarter as the Gauchos benefited from goals by junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, junior attacker Ryan Baliani, junior two-meter Liam Gaughan and two from Snyder.</p>\n<p>Going into the second half both teams looked to continue playing physically in the close contest. It ended up being a half of missed opportunities for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The first big play of the second half was a penalty shot opportunity for the Gauchos. Snyder stepped up in the one-on-one opportunity against Long Beach St.’s junior goalie Pavo Ljepopio, and ripped a shot that hit the post.</p>\n<p>Later in the quarter the Gauchos wasted a six-on-three opportunity with a shot over the goal and continued to miss chances to put more points on the board. UCSB hit the post back-to-back in one possession, and freshman attacker Shane Hauschild was stopped on a breakaway opportunity before he was able to take a shot.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we did miss two penalties and didn’t capitalize on a six-on-three opportunity,” Wigo said. “Those were critical moments.”</p>\n<p>Entering the fourth quarter, the game was still a close contest with Long Beach St. leading 12-9. After the 49ers got an early goal in the quarter, the Gauchos pulled a goal back as Hauschild converted a penalty shot opportunity. Long Beach St. then countered with a goal of its own before Hauschild had another penalty shot. This time Ljepopio made the save, conserving his team’s four-goal lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos pushed back as they scored two goals from Cappon and senior utility Brendan McElroy to cut the deficit to two with 1:23 to go. After a couple of missed shots, the game came to a close with the score 14-12.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look towards this weekend when they face top competition at the So Cal Tournament at UCLA.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56459\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56459\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/","id":525,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[524,523,522],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
