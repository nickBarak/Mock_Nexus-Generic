Often this is true, whether it be Eli Manning leading the Giants on a fourth quarter comeback, or Jerry Rice cutting through the Bengals defense play after play, many Super Bowls have been decided simply by a great player taking control of the game. Although football is most definitely a team sport, it is also one in which moments and players are mythologized. “The Drive” and “The Catch” are two examples of how football fans and analysts love to find and memorialize key plays and players, especially in the biggest game of all.</p>\n<p>Super Bowl LII will be between the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles and the AFC Champion New England Patriots. As a Giants fan who has rooted against both these teams on many occasions, it pains me to say that they both have proved to be the best in their respective conferences without a doubt. Even with key injuries to both squads (Carson Wentz being out for the Eagles, Gronk missing some time for the Pats) they have actually gotten stronger as units as the year has gone on, which is precisely why it is hard to single out who the x-factor’s will be on both sides. Instead of just choosing a player who I think will be the best for each team, I split potential players into two tiers based on how likely they are to win Super Bowl MVP and overall what their impact will be on the field.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80727\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2023388365\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80733\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80727\" data-attachment-id=\"80727\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/super-bowl-lii-sleeper-picks/tom-brady-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=953%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"953,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tom brady graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=888%2C671&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-80727\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=800%2C604\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"604\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?w=953&amp;ssl=1 953w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C580&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80727\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Son / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><b>The Favorites</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I predict that this year won’t be any different as both Tom Brady and Nick Foles, who have the best and second best chance to win the award according to Vegas, pretty much will have to carry their respective offenses. The Eagles and Patriots finished the regular season as bottom 10 rushing teams, and the Pats have only managed to muster up 73.5 yards per game in the playoffs. Foles and Brady have done a good job handling this load so far, as their 122 and 107 QBR show, but it remains to be seen which one will outshine the other.</p>\n<p><b>Dark Horses</b></p>\n<p>As opponents of the Patriots have learned in the past, the best way to mitigate Tom Brady’s impact is to get pressure on him, and if there is one thing Eagles DT Fletcher Cox knows how to do it’s creating pressure. His 10 combined tackles in the Postseason is the highest among Defensive Tackles, and while he only has one sack so far the amount of pressure he’s created indicates that he’s due for some more. If he’s able to disrupt the Patriots offensive line that’s only given up 3 sacks this year he could be heading home with the SBMVP trophy. On the Patriots side, Tight End Rob Gronkowski could be geared for a big game of his own. After being sidelined in the AFC Championship game with a concussion, Gronk will be looking to take advantage of his size in this upcoming matchup. He’ll have about a 6” height and 60 pound weight advantage over his primary defender who will be safety Malcolm Jenkins for the Eagles. IF Gronk is able to open up the field for Tom Brady, there’s no doubt that the Eagles will have a very tough time staying in the game, and he will likely be adding a Super Bowl MVP trophy to go along with a third championship ring.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

But international students, who compose 14% of the campus population, face the possibility that if they leave the country, they won’t be able to return.<em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if she could go back home, there was the looming possibility that she would either contract the virus while there or be denied reentry into the United States, and thus be unable to return to UCSB, she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall Quarter 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are 3,261 international undergraduate students attending UCSB — composing 14% of the campus population — as well as 914 international graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these international students are in the same situation as Xu — unable to return to their home countries, but unable to remain in the dorms without paying the $300 spring break housing fee. UCSB’s Global Gaucho Commission (GGC), a student organization that advocates for the interests of international students on campus, is working to alleviate that financial burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles K. Neumann, a fourth-year global studies and political science double major and co-founder and internal chair of GGC, explained that the organization made it a priority to push for housing vouchers for all students whose travel plans had been altered by the coronavirus, beginning in February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a survey conducted by the GGC of 100 Chinese students currently living in residence halls on campus, more than half of the respondents planned to either return to China or remain at a friend’s house or a hotel during spring break, Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But those results were from Week 6 of winter quarter, he noted, and “there are definitely students who are still having difficulty [with] finding places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative housing options that are currently available at UCSB are limited; students needing temporary housing must apply through the </span><a href=\"http://food.ucsb.edu/resources/housing/emergency-transitional-housing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Crisis Response Team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (FCRT), which approves each housing request one at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is a more universal kind of deal where all students who are affected by the coronavirus [are] being given housing vouchers,” Neumann said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But according to Neumann, the process of advocating for spring break housing vouchers for any students, international or otherwise, is not an easy process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two weeks of continuous back and forth with the administration — including a trip to Cheadle Hall to speak with an absent Chancellor Henry T. Yang, multiple attempts at talking to the Division of Student Affairs and a petition — the GGC was eventually directed to Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE), according to Neumann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been copying from one contact source to another,” Neumann said. “And initially, we kind of felt like they were just passing us along, to kind of shift responsibility to somebody else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 21, HDAE sent an email to students living in university-owned housing to offer them the opportunity to stay in their current dorm during spring break given “an extenuating circumstance due to the travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, students who opt for this extra week of housing must still pay the fee. Neumann argued that since the cost originates from “a circumstance that is completely beyond anybody’s control,” the GGC still plans to meet with Garry Mac Pherson, the vice chancellor for administrative services, to discuss waiving the fee entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GGC is exploring alternative payment avenues in the event that UCSB does not waive the housing fee, Peter Feng, a second-year economics major and external chair of the GGC, said. According to Feng and Neumann, potential options include reimbursements after spring break from either the organization or A.S., a food-specific waiver for eating out in local establishments when the dining commons are closed during break and housing waivers from the FCRT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing that the administration cannot provide, Xu said, is certainty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [courses become] online, we are kind of worried whether we should go back to China or just stay here,” Xu said. At the time, UCSB had only announced that classes would take place remotely </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through the end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rather than through the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entire spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “We’ll just wait and see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a growing concern … of international students not being able to go home and not being able to reenter the United States,” Neumann said, which could force international students to stay in the U.S. during the summer and possibly prevent new international students from entering the country in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“International students are being overlooked in terms of resources and just care, compared to domestic students,” Neumann said. “Even now, international students are still receiving inadequate support from the university administration compared to what they deserve.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the following days, weeks and months have in store, Xu expressed that this situation was not ideal for anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all hope we can get over with this, right?” she said. “I hope everything could get back to normal as soon as possible.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Faculty were tasked with piecing together curriculum for online courses in only two weeks’ time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dunbar said that one of the major problems brought by the transition to remote instruction is UCSB’s lack of experience teaching online classes. The first time the Department of Communication ever offered an online major class was last year, when the University of California Office of the President offered grants for faculty to develop online courses, according to Dunbar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took me months to prepare it. I video recorded lectures, I thought carefully about pedagogy and how faculty can teach online without meeting the students,” Dunbar explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, with the pressure of all classes being taught online, the time to carefully develop courses is quickly dwindling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To just [prepare online courses] instantly overnight … We are not going to have that same kind of thoughtful pedagogy. It’s basically like, ‘What can we do to make sure that students get the information that we want them to get and what can we do to do the best that we can for students without letting them fall through the cracks?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dunbar said there is going to be a lot of trial and error for professors as they experiment with new tools and instruction methods that some have never used before, like Zoom for example. To aid one another in the transition to digital classrooms, professors across the country have even created a Facebook group — aptly named </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2528669267346197/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pandemic Pedagogy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — to ask for teaching advice and to share tips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge of moving classes online is further complicated by the ongoing </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/breaking-ucsb-graduate-students-vote-to-begin-full-strike-on-thursday-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of living adjustment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (COLA) strikes from graduate students across the UC system. At UCSB, graduate students have been striking since Feb. 27 to demand a COLA to offset high housing costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question remains as to how graduate students striking for COLA — some of whom have ceased all grading, office hours and teaching — will adjust in the move to online classes. Dunbar said she believes each faculty member will handle the situation differently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, language departments and programs face a unique problem as instructors struggle to find a way to translate rigorous, interactive and almost daily instruction into a digital platform, according to Valentina Padula, coordinator of the Italian Language Program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Padula said the program has an advantage compared to other language courses thanks to hybrid online classes that were already being offered by the department. Elements from the hybrid classes, such as visual materials and grammar tutorials, will be implemented into the fully online classes, Padula said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for regular lectures, Padula said that instructors will most likely use Zoom to teach classes. Instructors can also use Zoom to conduct various break-out sessions and hold dialogues — often required for oral exams — between smaller groups of students before reconvening as a class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some language programs in particular will face even more challenges, such as those that teach an alphabet other than the Latin alphabet, according to Magda Campo, an Arabic language lecturer. For Campo, having students continuously practice writing in Arabic is essential to learning and will be difficult to monitor in online classes, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/facing-a-digital-spring-quarter-ucsb-preps-faculty-for-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom workshops</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, students can be given the option to use the whiteboard feature to draw the characters of the alphabet to help meet this requirement, Campo said. She also said she is looking into various programs, such as Adobe and ProctorU, to supplement her normal teaching style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have to understand that the professors are nervous, that [we] are just trying our best to reassure the students that we will do our best to [teach] via Zoom,” Campo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from remote instruction, a closed UCSB campus means students will also lose access to a number of university resources, such as laboratories, which are needed to carry out experiments in many S.T.E.M. fields.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claudio Campagnari, professor and chair of the Department of Physics, said the department had multiple options for holding remote labs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option is to provide students with the measurements of the labs and ask for the data analysis, he said. Another option is for students to buy lab kits, conduct the experiments themselves and then later discuss the results via video conferencing, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain courses and upper division labs in the physics department that are normally considered prerequisites will be waived “to protect the students” from not fulfilling requirements needed for graduation, Campagnari said. There will also be the possibility of offering the course labs online during the summer “if things are not back to normal,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Campagnari also voiced concern about managing students all around the world, as time zones, censorship and internet access in different areas can hamper professors’ efforts to teach their students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professors across the departments are attempting to mitigate any possible negative effects on students, particularly those who are graduating. Within the Writing Program, graduating seniors and students relying on financial aid will be given priority for classes, as those two groups will be the most heavily impacted, Madeleine Sorapure, director of the program, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all departments, however, have been able to find alternative solutions to conducting courses amidst UCSB’s campus closure. The Department of Theatre and Dance was forced to cancel some winter quarter finals in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Irwin Appel, professor and chair of the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve used the word ‘heartsick’ a lot because faculty, we were particularly heartbroken to not be able to show the work that students had been working hard on all quarter,” Appel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the initial decision to move to remote instruction until just the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there was still the possibility of holding “a festival of some kind [in May] in our community of all the work that didn’t get to be shown [at the end of winter quarter],” Appel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when the decision to cancel in-person classes was extended through the end of spring quarter, Appel described it as “heartbreaking” and sympathized with the graduating class of 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are so particularly empathizing with seniors,” Appel said. “To go through an entire college career and be looking forward to all the events that happen as a senior, to looking forward to a particular way to leave this university, and to have that snatched away, is really, really profoundly difficult.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
