Williams wrote AB 3 as an alternative to establishing a CSD through the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in order to address the need for improved infrastructure and services in the I.V. community. Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud organized a group of UCSB students and I.V. residents to speak in favor of the bill during public comment.</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Williams said the bill is going straight to the committee because previous attempts to establish I.V. self-governance over the last 45 years have been stifled by LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“When a local LAFCO cannot take care of a very important, complicated but ever-present problem for 45 years, do we have the authority to take that back and act ourselves?” Williams said. “I think we do.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill has been thoroughly evaluated by the community since first being introduced to the Assembly in December.</p>\n<p>“While the CSD is not going through the traditional LAFCO process, this bill has undergone extensive community outreach, including 42 public meetings and four public town halls,” Williams said. “It truly reflects the majority opinion from the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the current conditions in I.V. are at a “breaking point” and require improved services such as additional police, a parking district and a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>“Critical infrastructure and services are not being provided and the safety and wellbeing of I.V.’s residents are not being adequately protected,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said AB 3 is an opportunity to redefine I.V. through the establishment of CSD.</p>\n<p>“We have consistently had a lack of opportunity to prove ourselves,” Schunk said. “We are consistently at the behest of media sources and every time something happens in Isla Vista, we are painted colors that we have no choice or say in.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Local Governance Committee Assemblymember and UCSB alumnus Brian Maienschein said, while he chose to abstain from voting on the motion because of his connection to USCB, he plans to continue working with Williams on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is unique,” Maienschein said. “I have been persuaded by the testimony today and just kind of my life experience there, so I won’t quite get to ‘yes,’ but I want to keep working with you and your office on this.”</p>\n<p>Maienschein said that AB 3 resonates with him on a personal level because of his experience living in Isla Vista for three years.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista sits in a unique position,” Maienschein said, “because of all the issues that have traditionally been there back since my time up through the current time. In fact, the latest incident was in literally one of the exact blocks I lived on. So this hits close to home for me.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-three year I.V. resident and homeowner Pegeen Souter said she opposes the bill and favors the LAFCO process because she feels AB 3 does not clarify funding and the role of UC Santa Barbara in a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It takes time and information to craft a solid and lasting form of government,” Souter said. “If this bill is to move forward, then it should go through the LAFCO process.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara LAFCO Executive Officer Paul L. Hood said the commission is taking an “oppose unless amended position” on AB 3, and the commission should be included in the formation process to ensure a financially feasible CSD.</p>\n<p>“We strongly believe the Santa Barbara LAFCO should be involved in the formation process,” Hood said. “We also believe that the LAFCO process would afford a feasibility study to be prepared, which would determine the viability, the sustainability of revenues that would be available to the new CSD.”</p>\n<p>California Association of Local Agency Formation Commissions (CALAFCO) Executive Director Pamela Miller said the commission does not oppose the CSD itself, but believes LAFCO should be included in its establishment.</p>\n<p>“CALAFCO is not arguing whether or not a CSD is the appropriate mechanism, our concerns lie in the bypassing of the LAFCO process,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller said, while there are certain components in AB 3 that LAFCO cannot grant, excluding the commission may lead to greater risks.</p>\n<p>“It is true, as the assemblyman said that LAFCO cannot approve the proposed governance structure or the proposed services to be provided,” Miller said. “But bypassing the comprehensive analysis is very dangerous … all of our concerns would be addressed if a comprehensive review by the LAFCO were done.”</p>\n<p>Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs board member and second-year communications and film and media studies double major Arielle Kronovet said one the biggest issues facing I.V. is inadequate parking.</p>\n<p>“I’m lucky I have parkway so I don’t have to deal with parking,” Kronovet said. “But last year I was searching sometimes for hours trying to find parking, and I couldn’t afford parking on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Kronovet, students need the government to protect students from property management companies that abuse their power and take advantage of students.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the year, my house was robbed,” Kronovet said. “There was no evidence of forced entry so the property management wouldn’t change the locks and they had a key. I called the property management, and they told me it wasn’t a high priority issue.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said a CSD in I.V. will require components LAFCO cannot establish, such as a UUT and a hybrid board with elected and hybrid board with elected and appointed members representing entities such as UCSB, SBCC and Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“What I wanted to convey to the legislature was the uniqueness of Isla Vista, and the fact that we had demanded a unique solution, requiring some elements that [neither] LAFCO nor the board of supervisors could grant,” Farr said. “Only the legislature could.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO members should offer alternative ways to help I.V. rather than criticize AB 3.</p>\n<p>“I can understand [LAFCO] having concerns, but they did not express more concern and care for the future of the community,” Farr said. “You can have questions and you can have concerns, but also, show us that you really do want to be helpful. I have to say I haven’t gotten that sense at the meetings.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, Isla Vista does not have a high source of income from sales or property taxes.</p>\n<p>“[I.V.] doesn’t have a lot of commercial development or other kinds of sales tax or transient occupancy tax generators, hotels and such and the community,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>“Properties in the community don’t change hands very often, so the property tax that has been being paid is probably much lower than if the property was sold and then reassessed.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator-elect and second-year political science major Louis Mariano said he appreciates Farr’s supporting AB 3 regardless of her position in the county.</p>\n<p>“She’s always been there for Isla Vista and been working hard for the county to focus on it,” Mariano said. “She’s in a tight squeeze, but I am very grateful she was for the bill, because she knows Isla Vista needs help.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said Maienschein’s support of AB 3 shows the importance of I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“It shows Isla Vista has faced the same issues over and over without a way to correct them permanently,” Abboud said. “The root of the issue has been no local control and no local self-determination. I think him being moved by his own personal experiences is indicative of why we need to pass this bill.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, students have shown they can efficiently hold leadership positions regardless of how long they live and stay in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Students are regularly elected and do a wonderful job,” Abboud said. “Just because students with a little ‘S’ are transient, students with a big ‘S’ aren’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article was titled “Contested Bill Addresses Isla Vista Self-Governance”.

murder</h3>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) held a memorial tree planting Wednesday to honor the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at the school’s West Campus.</p>\n<p>Students and administrators planted sunflowers and six trees to honor each of the six students who passed away last spring. SBCC President Lori Gaskin and two members of SBCC’s Associated Student Government spoke to dedicate the memorial grove. A plaque with the names of the six students sits in the middle of the grove.<br>\nGaskin said the memorial trees represent ongoing remembrance of the six students.</p>\n<p>“It is to honor and remember the victims through tree planting in order to have a permanent symbol of what happened last year,” Gaskin said. “It is for future generations to see so that it can live on in perpetuity and remembrance of those six victims.”</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, the event is an opportunity to unite Santa Barbara communities.<br>\n“Right now, it is time to work together with UCSB, Isla Vista and the Santa Barbara community, which is more of an opportunity for us to strengthen ties,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said college is a time of “joy, celebration and discovery,” and the victims should not have lost that time.</p>\n<p>“For those opportunities to be shattered is devastating, as it happened to the six young lives,” Gaskin said. “It causes reflection and calls to action for things to change.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government President and second-year undeclared major Colette Brown said the trees create a space to appreciate natural beauty and remember the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think it is necessary for us to use this space not only for something beautiful, but for those individuals who were killed last year in Isla Vista,” Brown said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63155\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63155\" data-attachment-id=\"63155\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/tree-memorial_lorenzo-basilio-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430925421\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"60\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tree Memorial_Lorenzo Basilio-10\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63155\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63155\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government Vice President of External Affairs and second-year business and administration major Caleb Ransom said the memorial grove will foster unity in support of those who were close to the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think this is crucial for the families and friends of those who have passed away,” Ransom said. “We all mourn and I think this is ultimately important for the community and the colleges because it brings everyone together. It goes to show that we are human and here for a purpose.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Laura Guzman said the dedication event was “positive,” because it brought people together to heal.</p>\n<p>“Victims died, however, people still express their concerns and support by remembering and honoring the victims,” Guzman said. “There is still light at the end of the tunnel and I think it is getting brighter because this beautification will remind us of the strength in unity.”</p>\n<p>Guzman said the strong demonstration of community support is an effective step towards healing the wounds left by last year’s tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Even though people are feeling pretty sad right now because we remember the tragedy, I am still thankful for being a part of this,” Guzman said. “I think it is important to remain thankful and give gratitude for the people who care to make a difference in sorrowful times.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of

holding a hearing regarding Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 13 in the Sacramento Legislative Office building to decide whether to send the bill to the Senate floor or to refute the legislation.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams’ office has made several amendments to the bill since it was introduced to the California State Assembly in December 2014 to establish a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista, which would have the ability to levy taxes to fund local services and infrastructure. The Assembly’s Local Governance Committee will now determine whether it will be submitted to the full Assembly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said if the Assembly’s Local Governance Committee approves of the bill in the hearing next week, the legislation will continue on the path to be officiated by October of this year.</p>\n<p>“The hearing next week will determine if the bill moves on to full assembly or not,” Abboud said in an email. “If it does, we are still on schedule to pass the bill by October if everything continues to go smoothly.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double-major Cameron Schunk said the bill’s inclusion of a Utilities User Tax (UUT), which allows the CSD to apply a tax on utilities such as water, electricity and gas, will potentially raise the most issues in the hearing next week.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Isla Vista’s situation is so unique. The Utilities User Tax provides an option for the district to fit the taxation needs of I.V. – A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>The bill’s supporters have yet to complete a financial feasibility report to determine whether such a tax is necessary, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“I think that the fear and contention is around the fact that we’re putting this forward before a financial feasibility report,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the UUT is necessary for a CSD in I.V. because it is home to a majority of renters and short-term residents.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista’s situation is so unique,” Schunk said. “The Utilities User Tax provides an option for the district to fit the taxation needs of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jason Garshfield said he believes legislators will not take AB 3 seriously because it lacks community support.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t something that a lot of people seem to be pushing for,” Garshfield said in an email. “I think we might not get support from the state because I.V. hasn’t really proved itself to be a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he is “cautiously optimistic” the bill will pass despite the possible controversy surrounding the inclusion of the UUT, though the effort will require the support of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“We need to show local support for the unique solutions we’ve put in the bill, like the Utilities User Tax,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, if the bill is killed in the hearing, the establishment of I.V. self-governance may be delayed until the 2020s.</p>\n<p>“If [AB 3] doesn’t pass, this would have to be a two-year bill and therefore there won’t be a chance at I.V. self-governance until 2018 at the very earliest, or probably not until the 2020’s,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If [AB 3] doesn’t pass, this would have to be a two-year bill and therefore there won’t be a chance at I.V. self-governance until 2018 at the very earliest, or probably not until the 2020’s. – SBCC Trustee Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said the end of AB 3 would mean the introduction of alternative solutions to Isla Vista “self-determination,” such as pushing the county or university to provide funding or support instead of establishing a CSD.</p>\n<p>“At that point, which I consider to be the unwanted scenario, my and other activists’ efforts will have to become focused on pursuing our community’s right to self-determination through other means,” Schunk said in an email. “Those other means, in many cases, have very little real authority and can do very little at addressing the underlying issues in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he is renting a 12-person van to transport AB 3 supporters next Tuesday evening to Sacramento to lobby for the Wednesday hearing and demonstrate Isla Vista’s support for AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Anyone is welcome to come,” Schunk said in an email. “The broader the community support, the more powerful our sentiment will be.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he is fully prepared to “eat his words” if the bill passes and will be happy to have some form of self-governance in I.V. even if it is not the independent cityhood he prefers.</p>\n<p>“I’d be happy to see some form of I.V. self-governance come into effect during my time as a student here,” Garshfield said in an email. “I just think that AB 3 is a half measure that still leaves us under the partial jurisdiction of the county.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Open Lab” began selling blue LED tea lights and ropes on May 9 to be placed throughout UCSB’s campus and Isla Vista as part of “Blunite,” one part of the series of May 23 memorial events.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab students have asked individuals to place the tea lights at their residences and have worked with local business owners to plan light installments in I.V. restaurants. The Blunite project was inspired by the Media Arts and Technology graduate program’s idea to line Pardall Tunnel with blue LED lights to signify the connection between I.V. and UCSB. The Blunite lights use LED technology invented by Nobel Prize-winning UCSB Professor Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab student and second-year art and theater double major Madeline Berger said Blunite will symbolize unity in I.V. throughout May.</p>\n<p>“Blunite is a way to unify us together in solidarity and bring light and hope to our community even though there was so much darkness last year,” Berger said. “We are really trying to focus not so much on the memorial or the tragedy but more on how to show that we are just as unified as we were last year as a community, we really want to make this an annual tradition.”</p>\n<p>Berger said I.V. businesses including Sweet Alley, Pizza My Heart, Sorriso Italiano and Buddha Bowls have cooperated with Blunite organizers.</p>\n<p>“Every single business we’ve talked to has been like ‘That’s an awesome idea,’” Berger said. “We just installed Sorriso’s and Buddha Bowls’ yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Berger said Blunite hopes to distribute the same LED lights at the memorial candlelight vigil planned for the evening of May 23 and that Blunite provides an opportunity for individuals to support I.V. even if they no longer live in the community.</p>\n<p>“This could be something that people could do in New York City if they went to school here and are in grad school now and want to show their support, they can put a tea light in their window and take a picture and send it to us,” Berger said. “Businesses can get involved and students can get involved … it’s a different way of getting people to join together in something.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab student and third-year communication and art major Raphaella Faria said the project organizers hope every I.V. resident will get involved with Blunite so the community can “glow blue” by the end of May.</p>\n<p>“People are cooperating really well but we are just trying to get the word out faster,” Faria said, “We are hoping that, with people starting to show their support, others will be inspired by them.”</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to be an all month thing,” Berger said. “It’s kind of turned into something where at the vigil you can carry them, so we are trying to get funding so we can pass them out at the vigil. It’s a good way to not have flame and wax dripping on everything.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and accounting major Brian Attard, who purchased a light Saturday at the Pardall Center, Blunite’s message of unity will benefit I.V. during the anniversary of the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important to preserve the memories of the people we lost and to look at their families and how they moved on and just draw strength from that as a community,” Attard said. “It’s a nice gesture to have these lights, it’s very UCSB because the guy who invented them is a professor here so it all kind of works out.”</p>\n<p>Blunite will use profits from the light sales throughout May to provide free tea lights for those who can’t purchase them for the vigil, according to Berger.</p>\n<p>“The tea lights are getting sold for a dollar, but they cost us 70 cents,” Berger said. “So the extra 30 cents is coming back to us so that we can buy lights that we can just give out to people that can’t afford them, or at the vigil.”</p>\n<p>Students can purchase tea lights and ropes at the Pardall Center, participating restaurants such as Buddha Bowls and Sorriso Italiano or by messaging the Blunite Facebook page.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/blunite-seeks-to-unite-i-v/","id":4706,"author":{"id":173,"name":"Adelaide Burk"},"related":[4705,4704,4703],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
