According to the formal complaint filed by attorneys, Catherine Short and LLDF member Allison Arranda, the UC Regents never contacted or apologized to any of the plaintiffs regarding the case. Following the incident, Vice-Chancellor Michael Young sent out an email warning students about non-students promoting personal agendas in an effort to provoke individuals on campus.</p>\n<p>The suit also names recent alumnae Briana Brown and alumna Erika Ito as defendants in the case. The brief describes the actions of the defendants as “willful, wanton, malicious and oppressive” and done in “reckless disregard” of Short and her fellow protesters’ rights.</p>\n<p>In a press release, LLDF President Dana Cody stated that Miller-Young did not conduct herself in a manner consistent with her profession.</p>\n<p>“This is a mature, supposedly educated woman charged by the University of California to convey knowledge, and instead she conveyed discrimination and intolerance,” Cody stated. “Not only was she out of line in attacking students, but she literally drew blood from a minor.”</p>\n<p>In August, Miller-Young was found guilty of misdemeanor vandalism and battery, and was sentenced to 108 hours of community service and three years of probation.</p>\n<p>The complaint was filed to “vindicated [the plaintiff’s] own rights and rights of others” to engage in free speech on a public university campus.</p>\n<p>“Plaintiffs did not consent to the Defendants’ acts and found them to be harmful and offensive to their person and dignity,” the complaint stated. “Plaintiffs have suffered actual damages, including but not limited to emotional distress, fear, shock, anxiety, embarrassment, physical pain, damage to property, and loss of reputation.”</p>\n<p>According to the complaint, the defendant violated the first, fourth and fourteenth amendment of the Constitution, as well as California Civil Codes 51.7, which guarantees all persons within the jurisdiction of California have the right to be free from any violence or intimidation by threat of violence because of political affiliation.</p>\n<p>According to the California Civil Code, a person may be liable to pay $25,000 in civil damages for denying or conspiring to deny a person’s right under 51.7.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President as well as university administration declined comment on the pending litigation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

(<em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Members of the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) were in attendance during public forum of the Associated Students Senate meeting last night to combat a bill that would reduce S.C.O.R.E.’s decision-making authority regarding the planning of the Student of Color Conference (S.O.C.C.), shifting authority instead to the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs.</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E. is a campus organization that advocates for the rights for students of color and other underrepresented communities, and S.O.C.C. is a UC Students Association conference held this past weekend at UC Merced in which students discuss, among other topics, issues surrounding race. The controversial bill will be headed to the External Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow night to be voted on.</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. outreach coordinator Allison Bettencourt said the bill unfairly shifts the ability to organize S.O.C.C attendance to the EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it’s my understanding that it would be pulled out of S.C.O.R.E.’S jurisdiction to organize and put into the EVPSA’s,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this is wrong because S.C.O.R.E. has historically organized the Student of Color Conference delegation.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. member Leilani Riahi said the commission has always served minority students and that putting power in the hands of a non-minority would be detrimental to the students of color community.</p>\n<p>“The people in S.C.O.R.E. have always been there to serve this one purpose,” Riahi said. “They’re doing it for others. I know these people, I’ve seen them, worked with them to be elected to this space. You have to have communities of color in mind. Always. We’re already so marginalized, we already don’t have enough power in these fucking institutions, and to institutionalize racism … just give us this conference.”</p>\n<p>Bettencourt also said there was a lack of diversity on campus and that it is important to keep the power within the S.C.O.R.E. to compensate for the imbalance.</p>\n<p>“I believe our school has the least diversity of any other school and because of that, it is more necessary and pertinent than ever that the Student Commission on Racial Equality continues to organize this,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this Student of Color Conference falls directly under the mission of S.C.O.R.E. which is to educate people about the issues that affects students of color and to organize around those issues.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58250\" style=\"width: 579px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"800180484\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58217\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58250\" data-attachment-id=\"58250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/as-senate-by-kenneth-song_for-11-12-2014-7778/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=1200%2C817&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,817\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415834446\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate by Kenneth Song_for 11.12.2014-7778\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58250\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778-1024x697.jpg?resize=569%2C386\" alt=\"(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"569\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Second year pre-biology major and S.C.O.R.E. diversity educator Kyron Covington said it is essential that students of color organize S.O.C.C attendance and quoted Malcolm X, stating that “only a fool would let his enemy teach his children.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to condemn the proposed bill to take S.O.C.C away from S.C.O.R.E. because I would be a fool to let it happen,” Covington said. “For people that are new to these issues or ideas of social justice and problems that affect my community, I won’t let anyone else teach them because I know my community best. S.O.C.C. is organized by students of color because we would be fools otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur said that if the bill is passed and the committee created to choose S.C.O.R.E attendees is occupied by Caucasian students, it would contradict the purpose of S.C.O.R.E and their conference.</p>\n<p>“This five person committee y’all are suggesting could be all white, besides these S.C.O.R.E. co-chairs,” Kaur said. “It’s never acceptable for a majority white board to organize who gets to go to the Students of Color Conference.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is not in favor of this bill, at least not in the current language it is written in.</p>\n<p>“I think the conference bill, the language needs to be clarified,” Singh said. “I think people are getting the misconception that I for some reason want to take over these conferences, that’s not what’s happening. I’m personally opposed to anything that takes power from any AS entities, like that’s not what I envision that bill to be.”</p>\n<p>A version of the story appeared on page 4 of the Nov. 13, 2014 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/","id":2965,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2964,2963,2962],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stanford Psychology Professor Lectures on Student Mindset","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Stanford professor of psychology Carol Dweck delivered a lecture Thursday addressing the vital interconnection between an individual’s mindset in social interactions and academic achievement.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"58037\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/download-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/download.jpeg?fit=559%2C90&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"559,90\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"download\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/download.jpeg?fit=250%2C40&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/download.jpeg?fit=559%2C90&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-58037\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/download.jpeg?resize=500%2C81\" alt=\"download\" width=\"500\" height=\"81\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/download.jpeg?w=559&amp;ssl=1 559w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/download.jpeg?resize=250%2C40&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Stanford professor of psychology Carol Dweck delivered a lecture Thursday addressing the vital interconnection between an individual’s mindset in social interactions and academic achievement.</p>\n<p>In her lecture, called “Mindsets: Helping Students Fulfill Their Potential,” Dweck discussed her research on self-concepts and perceived intelligence as well as the relationship between genetics and the environment. Thursday’s lecture was part of an ongoing lecture series presented by the SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind.</p>\n<p>According to Dweck, contrary to popular belief, psychological traits can be influenced experience and are not necessarily inherent.</p>\n<p>“To me, a hallmark of human nature is how much is not built-in,” Dweck said. “In fact, maybe what is built-in is the capacity to learn and grow according to the world we find ourselves in.”</p>\n<p>Dweck said determining the relative influences of genetics or the environment on individual psychology is a central question in her research on psychological functioning.</p>\n<p>“It matters whether people believe their qualities are built-in and fixed by nature or whether they believe their qualities can be developed through nurture through their own efforts,” Dweck said. “It matters across many different domains of functioning.”</p>\n<p>To support her statement, Dweck said the findings of a study her team performed on adolescents, which measured how their mindsets affected their academic performance, consisted of measuring whether students entering the seventh grade thought their intelligence was something fixed or something that could be developed.</p>\n<p>According to Dweck, results showed students entering with similar past intelligence levels received varying grades, showing that intelligence can be developed with the right student mindset.</p>\n<p>Another study Dweck conducted looked at the relationship or lack thereof between income and mindset of 168,000 tenth graders in Chile.</p>\n<p>“At every level of family income, the mindset made a difference,” Dweck said. “Students with fixed mindsets showing the lowest [test scores] and those with growth mindsets the highest. Mindsets had as much predictive value as any economic indicator.”</p>\n<p>According to Dweck, another study conducted involved two groups of students all with declining grades put through varying study methods and mentalities.</p>\n<p>“The control group got eight sessions of great study skills, skills the teachers said were really important,” Dweck said. “The other group got eight lessons of study skills with a growth mindset.”</p>\n<p>The students with better mindsets showed improvement in their grades, whereas students receiving better resources but a mindset of fixed intelligence continued to have falling grades, according to Dweck.</p>\n<p>Dweck said she also explored the impact of different kinds of praise upon children’s test performance and that praising improvement led to more progress as opposed to praising intellect.</p>\n<p>“We had a program where we administered different kinds of praise in an experimental situation, finding that praising intelligence backfired. It put kids into a fixed mindset and made them vulnerable,” Dweck said “whereas praising process and effort led to more of a growth mindset and resilience in the face of obstacles.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58036\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58036\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/stanford-psychology-professor-lectures-on-student-mindset/","id":2966,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2965,2964,2963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Schunk, Reul Elected to A.S.

Legal Resource Center, with just over 16 percent of the student body voting in the Associated Students special election.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk was elected A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and second-year CCS Literature major Ethan Reul was elected A.S. Student Advocate General, beating out his competitor, third-year environment science major Sukayna Ibrahim. The proposal to increase the quarterly Legal Resource Center fee to $9.37 per student was voted down.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology and political science double-major Schunk said he will be focusing on the promotion of self-governance and residential outreach in Isla Vista during his term.</p>\n<p>“I want to offer people to have a say in the tax in Isla Vista, in the parking of Isla Vista, on a real legal level where they can make changes,” Schunk said. “I think you’d see an increase in student participation.”</p>\n<p>According to Reul, the Office of the Student Advocate has not been able to access their budget during the vacancy in the Student Advocate General position since only the Student Advocate General can review the budget.</p>\n<p>“Up until this point, our office hasn’t actually had access to our funds because we haven’t had a Student Advocate General,” Reul said. “We’ve actually had to go to advisors to get permission to print flyers to talk about Halloween.

And so many people that could have gotten help that weren’t able to get help just because they didn’t know the resources were there. I know how much it matters and I know how much they care.”</p>\n<p>Reul also said he hopes to educate students about the resources Office of the Student Advocate offers.</p>\n<p>“I’m really looking forward to increasing the efficiency of the office,” Reul said. “I think we do a lot of different things for the student body, but the student body doesn’t really know that much about what we do.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Reul state the failed A.S. Legal Resource Center fee would impact the budget of the Office of the Student Advocate. That is incorrect, the A.S. Legal Resource Center is a completely separate office from the Office of the Student Advocate. The article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the voter turnout was 5 percent.
