Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five professors from various university departments spoke about recent developments in their research and other ideas at the third annual UCSB TEDx talk on Saturday in Embarcadero Hall in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Technology, Entertainment, Design, or TED, is a nonprofit organization aimed at spreading general knowledge about the world and new ideas through a series of conferences. The organization hosts a main event every year in Vancouver, Canada, but also promotes independently organized events on a local scale called TEDx. This year’s TEDxUCSB is titled “Unveiling the New: In the Pursuit of the Next” and was organized by the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (RCSA).</p>\n<p>Featured presenters included chemical engineering professor Frank Doyle, Gevirtz Graduate School of Education lecturer Jason Duque Raley, computer science professor Diana Franklin, sociology professor Victor Rios and sociology Professor Emeritus Thomas Scheff. Two pre-recorded TED talks by British journalist Matt Ridley and neuroscience professor at Baylor College of Medicine David M. Eagleman were also played at the event.</p>\n<p>Second-year zoology major and TEDx Event Organizer Edward Trout said TEDx conferences are valuable because the talks expose students to a slew of new ideas.</p>\n<p>“TEDx breaks through the brilliant shroud that surrounds all this knowledge and allows us all to see it, allows us to think about it, allows us to spread it around,” Trout said. “‘Ideas worth spreading,’ that’s the TED motto.”</p>\n<p>The attendee application required potential audience members to submit their own idea worth spreading, and answers were projected onto a screen as audience members entered Embarcadero Hall. The submissions ranged from the colonization of other planets to healthcare reform and the emotional struggle of the research process.</p>\n<p>Rios, the first presenter, spoke about the need to reassess current education strategies in order to effectively teach millennial students. According to Rios, this generation is considered by some authors and scholars to be the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic” generation yet, an idea he said he disagrees with.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Rios said the key to educating a globally connected millennial generation is to modify current strategies of education to be more emotional, citing studies that found millennials are more focused on personal connections and making an impact on society, rather than earning more money at the expense of others.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>Doyle spoke next and discussed his 20 years of research in control engineering, including the creation of an artificial pancreas to automate insulin delivery in patients with Type 1 diabetes based on a concept called feedback control.</p>\n<p>“If I were to break down feedback control into a very simple definition, it’s these three words: ‘sense and respond,’” Doyle said.</p>\n<p>According to Doyle, insulin pumps and glucose sensors are currently available to help diabetes patients, but only focus on either the sense or respond parts of the equation.</p>\n<p>“What’s missing is that conjunction in the middle, the ‘and,’” Doyle said. “So our research has been all about that little three-letter word, the conjunction ‘and,’ making these two pieces better, responding to glucose measurements, squirting the insulin in just such a way that we can optimize those blood sugars.”</p>\n<p>Doyle said the pancreas’s control of blood sugar levels is an example of a negative feedback loop, producing hormone insulin when blood sugar levels are high, in order stabilize blood glucose levels and glucagon when blood sugar levels drop in order to raise them. The pancreas produces insulin to mitigate the potentially dangerous effects of high blood sugar including organ damage, a process that fails to occur in individuals with Type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p>Doyle also said using a control algorithm in a chip or tablet connected to the sensing and responding technology allowed his research group to create a device to monitor and secrete insulin to stabilize the patient’s blood sugar levels to be in a healthy range, closing the feedback loop broken by diabetes, and thus treating a disease that currently affects millions.</p>\n<p>“The improper secretion of insulin leads to diabetes, which is a worldwide problem,” Doyle said. “It probably touches many of you in the audience, unfortunately. Friends, family members, neighbors — close to 400 million people in the world suffer from diabetes, and about half of them aren’t even diagnosed.”</p>\n<p>Varun Battu, a second-year biochemistry major, said he found Doyle’s talk fascinating because it applied biochemistry principles to technology.</p>\n<p>“It’s biochem — it’s literally what I like, and he’s applying it to a real world situation,” Battu said. “It’s really innovative and state-of-the-art — the top of his field.”</p>\n<p>Franklin’s talk focused on the growing, education-based gap between economic classes and how computer science, an increasingly important field, can help close this gap. Franklin said she believes computer science can be used to combat inequality by integrating it into fourth-through-sixth-grade curriculums, exposing underprivileged children to computing early in life.</p>\n<p>“All of these children would see that everyone can do it,” Franklin said. “There is nothing special about being in computing. Anyone can be in computer science.”</p>\n<p>Franklin said she and a team of computer scientists created a summer camp called Animal Tlatoque, which combined educational workshops on culture, art and computing and, according to surveys, successfully heightened children’s interest in computer science.</p>\n<p>“By integrating computer science into an engaging, interdisciplinary camp we could really get students to get excited about it,” Franklin said.</p>\n<p>Professor Emeritus of sociology Thomas Scheff discussed the importance of expressing negative emotions in mental health.</p>\n<p>“Emotions are very confusing because we have a whole culture in the West which makes fun of emotions and ignores them and says they’re not important,” Scheff said. “When they do happen, they’re a pest.”</p>\n<p>Scheff said English’s inaccurate words for expressing emotions complicate the study of emotions.</p>\n<p>“It’s a field that is harassed, especially in English, by the ambiguity and circumstantial grasp of emotion terms,” Scheff said. “Pride can be a good thing. You should be proud your children accomplished so much, but it can also be the seventh deadly sin.”</p>\n<p>According to Scheff, each emotion has a different signal of resolution — a different way the hormones produced by the emotion are metabolized by the body — and this signal is the healthiest way to deal with emotions.</p>\n<p>“When you’re talking about grief — if you lose someone that’s close to you, your body prepares to sob with tears … if that is delayed, you feel grief … fear, grief, shame, anger are not negative when they’re not obstructed,” Scheff said. “They go through your body — they’re something you need to do, just like breathing.”</p>\n<p>Duque spoke about reformulating common complaints about the educational system and trying to make the educational community understand that the current system shrinks students’ worlds by encouraging them to become competitive and answer-focused learners.</p>\n<p>“I think we mostly have things we can agree on when we think about school. School works for some kids and doesn’t for others,” Duque said. “We’ve got a collection of complaints about schooling but … then what?”</p>\n<p>Duque said he built a new set of complaints when he examined a kindergarten class in a dual immersion Spanish-English school designed to give underrepresented children a better chance to succeed academically. According to Duque, the students initially sought out other students to learn with, but the openness had decreased by January of the school year.</p>\n<p>“It begins to look like the children have learned that the world is not only theirs to explore, but that other people are either competitors for a place to declare what they know or they’re people who already possess knowledge,” Duque said. “Other people are threats and at least part of the time, other people are to be feared.”</p>\n<p>According to Duque, students’ passion for learning can only be encouraged by drastically changing how the students are formally taught.</p>\n<p>“Be outrageous in your refusal to do things the same old way because, let me tell you, we keep doing things the same old way; kids are going to keep learning the same old thing,” Duque said. “And that same old thing they’re learning is, from where I stand, a tragedy.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics math major and volunteer for the TEDx event Dixon Bourne said the event taught him to be more courageous.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to be less cautious,” said Bourne. “Just try things and not be afraid to fail. That’s probably one of the biggest things I learned.”</p>\n<p>Eric Seeberger, a second-year mechanical engineering major and TEDx attendee, said his “idea worth sharing” is about the increasing importance of finding sustainable energy solutions.</p>\n<p>“I think that the most important technology we should be researching is becoming energy independent,” Seeberger said. “Solar power is important and in the far future, nuclear fusion would probably be the best way to sustain that.”</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major, Event Coordinator and Speaker Liaison Mary Alice Callaghan said she was amazed by the wealth of opportunities and ideas available to students in everyday life.</p>\n<p>“What I took away from this conference, even more so than last year, was that there are just so many great minds and great opportunities on this campus — these great talks came from professors on our campus,” Callaghan said, “You think of TEDx as this really cool, once-a-year event that you come to experience these ideas, but they’re really out there all the time if you just go looking for them.”</p>\n<p>According to Trout, the TEDx model is important because it shares cutting edge ideas while fostering a sense of community.</p>\n<p>“TEDx embodies a mission that is important to me and important to all of us,” Trout said. “Not only is it presented to the community, TEDx is made by the community. Speakers of the sciences, arts and humanities — they all come together and present their ideas to you. They unveil the new and they allow all of us to pursue what’s next.”</p>\n<p>Trout said this year’s TEDx is especially important to him because TEDx 2014 was the last time he would see high school friend Chris Martinez, member of last year’s TEDx crew and victim of last May’s shooting.</p>\n<p>“When he [Martinez] found out we were putting on the TEDx event, he was so excited to be a part of it, to be part of what it was, part of what this is,” said Trout. “This TEDx is important to me personally now because it involves him. However, I would rather celebrate his life and what he did by showing you all awesome things rather than mourn him for too long.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While the festival’s date in India changes from year to year and took place on March 6 this year, Indus held the event on April 12 due to scheduling conflicts with other events last quarter. This year’s Holi event sold the most colored powder and attracted the largest crowd since Indus began hosting the event in 2013.</p>\n<p>Indus Representative and first-year chemistry major Yash Pal said Holi holds great significance in traditional Indian culture and brings together people from different social classes.</p>\n<p>“It’s meant to bring everybody together, so in India it would be like to celebrate the end of winter, the beginning of spring harvest time, so it’s a happy time,” Pal said. “In India there’s the caste system with lots of divisions, but when people play Holi you’re just supposed to all be wearing the same stuff, nobody knows what division you’re in — you all just get colorful like the same way.”</p>\n<p>According to Pal, UCSB Indus’ Holi event has similar meaning to the traditional celebrations taking place in India.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB it does the same thing. It brings everyone together,” Pal said. “This is an Indian celebration but there’s a bunch of people here, there’s a bunch of diversity, everyone’s having fun together.”</p>\n<p>Indus Treasurer and third-year economics and mathematics double major Nitin Seelim said not only has the event drawn bigger crowds over the years, there has also been an increase in diversity among the students who attend.</p>\n<p>“It used to be South Asians specifically, but now we are getting more diversity,” Seelim said. “We started selling Holi powder last year and it was first conducted on this campus two years ago. Last year, we had about 1,000 people, now we have over 2,000 people, each year our turnout is much greater, and [we make] more money selling Holi powder which we use to help conduct other events.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At UCSB it does the same thing. It brings everyone together. This is an Indian celebration but there’s a bunch of people here, there’s a bunch of diversity, everyone’s having fun together. – Indus Freshman Representative Yash</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seelim said he believes the Holi event was unique because it was hosted on the beach, making for a more aesthetically pleasing backdrop and easier cleanup.</p>\n<p>“In India it’s usually done on the streets or alleys where people just throw powder at each other. Not the best scene to look at,” Seelim said. “But beside the beach on campus, it’s very nice and much easier to clean up because the beach cleans it up. It happens once a year, a safe party kind of thing, but you get to learn more about the culture of India — how some events happen — and it attracts more people to our club.”</p>\n<p>According to Roshan Roy, Indus social chair and third-year biopsychology major, Holi is a way for the university community to learn more about Indian culture and add more variety to the UCSB social scene.</p>\n<p>“It adds a lot of diversity to our campus and enriches the culture so that we’re not a campus about partying and drinking,” Roy said. “It’s about learning about different cultures and overall just enriching our overall education.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Vinay Gupta said he has attended Holi every year since enrolling at the university when Indus began hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“Holi is growing in a lot of universities,” Gupta said. “It’s kind of becoming like a trend when it originally started as an Indian holiday, mainly because it’s a lot of fun. Everyone’s covered in color so you can’t tell who’s who, so it can make a statement about equality and race.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Jonah Calio said Holi exceeded his expectations and that he plans on attending next year.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it to be as big as it was. It was way more awesome,” Calio said. “I didn’t think I would get this colorful either. I just liked seeing people you know and hitting them with color.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Rachel Fulton said she was also surprised by the event’s turnout.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of people, and it was really fun,” Fulton said. “I didn’t think there was going to be as many people and as fun as it was.

She also wants to create a program for sexual assault awareness training, similar to the one all Greek life members undergo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to reach out to students in I.V. and on campus to make them aware of what A.S. does and what resources are available to them. She would also like to work with the police in I.V. to mediate student relations and advocate for survivor-oriented sexual assault policies.</span></p>\n<p><b>POLICE PRESENCE IN I.V.:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes relying on UCIV, a volunteer group that offers assistance to partygoers during weekends, as student liaisons between students and police is the right step. She wants to move toward community policing because she believes the police presence in I.V. makes people uncomfortable.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to hold forums with police officers at least once a quarter to ease relations between students and officers. She also aims to create an environment where students feel comfortable reaching out to police for help.</span></p>\n<p><b>HALLOWEEN:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes Halloween in recent years has seen I.V. become a police state and said most people spend Halloween out of town. She wants to implement different events in I.V. so that students can enjoy Halloween in I.V. without partying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to work on opening up conversations, citing the CSD’s Deltopia Town Hall as an example of a productive discussion. She also wants to reach out to students who are usually not involved in these spaces and work with the CSD to ensure that student safety is the top priority. </span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico cited her experience working as the CSD coordinator for the EVPLA office in which she was the liaison between the campus community and the CSD. She also helped the CSD implement a policy internship for students to give them experience in government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer spoke about her work canvassing for Measures E and F as well as her experience in Campus Democrats, which allowed her to make connections with Congressman Salud Carbajal as well as Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico spoke about her plan to utilize the width of I.V. streets to implement slanted parking on one side and parallel parking on the other, which would open up many more parking spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to maximize the space in I.V. that is already available as well as work with the future A.S. President to make on-campus parking cheaper so commuter students avoid parking in I.V. and taking up spaces for I.V. residents. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Senators listen to funding requests from student organizations. <em>Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met yesterday in the State Street Room in the University Center to hear funds requests from eight student organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund one organization, table two requests indefinitely, recommend one organization to seek funding from senate and not fund four requests. They started the meeting with $12,009 in the culture weeks and graduation fund, $3,196 in the senate unallocated fund, and zero dollars in all other funds including the sports teams, OSL and Student Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP) funds.</p>\n<p>The Committee indefinitely tabled decisions on the Geography Club, which requested $260, and the Pacific Island Student Association, which requested $5228, because their representatives were not present.</p>\n<p>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion y Revolucion (M.U.J.E.R.), an advocacy group for Chicana and Latina students, requested $3,006.60 for the food and venue for their annual MUJERcitas conference, which has brought in around 150 high school girls each of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Committee chairman and third-year history of public policy Jimmy Villarreal said the committee had to deny M.U.J.E.R. of all funding, because their request would come out of SIOP.</p>\n<p>UCSB Cycling Team president Richard Lo requested $1,000 from Finance Board to offset the cost of airfare to road nationals, as the team has been unable to get funding from other sources.</p>\n<p>“We are looking to send four men and three women to road nationals in May,” Lo said. “We have already looked at rec sports and other external funding, but we haven’t gotten any.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said the committee had no money to grant the team.</p>\n<p>“We are zeroed out of our sports funds, but we will discuss if we can find any other source,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>The Film Studio requested $500 for purchasing food, a red carpet and rental of I.V. Theater for their upcoming annual festival.</p>\n<p>“We are currently organizing our fifth annual Santa Barbara Digital Film Festival,” the representative said. “The event is open to the entire campus. Anyone can submit.”</p>\n<p>The committee motioned to deny the Studio all requested funds and suggest they take their request to senate.</p>\n<p>The Pink Research Link, which encourages UCSB students to take interest in breast cancer research, requested $75 to help recruit new members using flyers.</p>\n<p>“It is already a small club, and it is mostly made up of the officers, which are either graduating or studying abroad next year,” the representative said. “We are really looking to recruit new students, because recently we have made a lot of progress in what we have been able to do for breast cancer awareness.”</p>\n<p>The committee denied the club’s request, but committee advisor Cindy Lopez suggested they request the $250 startup, which they would be guaranteed to receive if they meet the basic criteria.</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Café (JLC) requested $280 for food and drinks for their quarterly potluck and karaoke party, which is historically their biggest event, but the committee denied their request.</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, the committee’s shrinking budget restricted all of their decisions.</p>\n<p>“We are getting toward the end of the year, so we’re low on funds now,” Villarreal said. “We allocated them to all the different student groups and we’ve had a lot of nice events.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-hears-student-funding-requests/","id":2818,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2817,2816,2815],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
