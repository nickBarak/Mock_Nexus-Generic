Her bandana bounced onto the oversized hoodie with each hum of bass. A person in a T-Rex costume nearly shoulder-checked a shirtless python-armed man, skipping his way back to the dance floor. On Saturday, Jan. 31, this smorgasbord of unlikely companions gathered at Earl Warren Showgrounds for one reason — the all-star DJ cast of Zimmer, AC Slater, Djemba Djemba and, of course, LOUDPVCK.</p>\n<p>Zimmer’s set was a good introduction to Saturday’s theme: Play a little something for everyone. Down-tempo grungy was the icebreaker as the French DJ began the long and grueling process of warming a crowd of standers.</p>\n<p>As people trickled in one-by-one, the groove deviated from its original trajectory. Low bass hums gradually sharpened into intermittent synth stabs. Swaying began in the crowd, and cross-armed fraternity brothers tapped their feet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Zimmer’s tropical remix of “Don’t Wanna Dance” echoed throughout the dome, as hip shakes possessed the small crowd of a few hundred.</p>\n<p>Felix Dechant, longtime Zimmer fan, concluded that Zimmer’s set was a very traditional deep European set that didn’t really fit into the theme of the of the entire show. However, he went on to say that the set was very artfully crafted and performed its job of loosening the crowd.</p>\n<p>Next on the menu was AC Slater. The Dim Mak DJ’s set was the closest thing to a club mix that evening and transformed the crowd entirely. Audience members were jumping and fist pumping to the guttural tribal sounds of Slater. “Woo’s” and chants could be heard over each layer of white noise.</p>\n<p>While the crowd was visibly more energetic, Slater’s performance was largely unchanging with the occasional sprinkling of crowd-pleasing tracks like CoCo.”</p>\n<p>Andrew Swanson, or Djemba Djemba as his diehard fans know him, spun the most versatile tracks of the evening. Swanson mixed everything from future bass to traditional trap to deep house to straight hip hop. Unfortunately, the track selection was slightly lower energy than the hard-to-please crowd needed. While there was a certain degree of moshing for hits such as “NRG” and RL Grime’s “Core,” in general the crowd was largely stationary, probably in anticipation of more big room house music.</p>\n<p>Katelyn Carano, a hoop dancer hired for the event, offered an explanation for the lackluster prestige of electronic music performances in Santa Barbara. Carano implied that there is a much smaller scene of electronic music fans in SB than in other metropolitan cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles. As a result, Santa Barbara shows are usually comprised of partiers who have never heard of the acts, avid festival goers, traditional Kandi-wearing ravers and spiritual types that run the local transformative festival, Lucidity. As a result, DJs experience issues tailoring their sets to such a diverse audience.</p>\n<p>However, nobody overcame this obstacle better than LOUDPVCK. The “Kill Bill” fight theme song blared through speakers as the silhouettes of Kenny Beats and Ryan Marks became visible behind the DJ stand.</p>\n<p>After ten minutes of the loudest festival trap of the evening, Marks grabbed the mic and shouted, “That was the warm-up round!” The crowd danced with ferocity as PVCK dropped one festival standard after another.</p>\n<p>To charge up the visibly tiring crowd, Marks put his lips to the microphone once again. “Who’s a ’90s baby out there?” he shouted. Dancers erupted as “California Love” bumped over the speakers followed by “Still D.R.E.” and “Big Poppa.”</p>\n<p>“I graduated from Santa Barbara High School,” Marks said into the mic, a few minutes before the end of the show. The statement mustered the last ounce of energy remaining in the depleted showgrounds.</p>\n<p>Ending with their latest Dada Life remix, LOUDPVCK said their thanks to a roaring crowd. While they did not spin the most innovative set, they knew their demographic and appropriately calibrated their gears. PVCK put on a good set but an even better show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/loudpvck-turns-earl-warren-into-a-trap-house-for-one-night/","id":7006,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[7005,7004,7003],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek","biography":"Not available","articles":[6741,6761,6954,6964,6966,6978,6986,7006,7064,7091,7097,7101,7610,7731],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Patti Smith Plays Explosive Show at the Granada Godmother of Punk Rock Sells Out Arts & Lectures Gig","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sitting at the edge of the Granada theater stage, the godmother of punk rock shook her silver hair out before jumping down, landing with a feathery thud into the thin carpet.

A collective gasp came from 272 audience members sitting in the front section who held their breath as she moved past them, dancing and clapping for her band onstage. Humble as ever, she tried to make herself a member of the crowd, giving her beloved guitarist of over 25 years Lenny Kaye time to shine. But it didn’t work. All eyes were on the otherworldly woman roaming through the aisles: Patti Smith.</p>\n<p>Sexy, expressive and constantly in motion, Smith and her band played a 15-song set as part of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures winter season. Wearing jeans that bagged around the knees and her signature menswear blazer, Smith bent gender roles through her feisty cool girl stage presence. Described by the late rock critic Lester Bangs in 1976 as a “badass who pulls off the feat of being simultaneously idol of women and lust object of men,” the 68-year-old rocker continued to bring the badassery.</p>\n<p>In between verses of “Ain’t It Strange,” she sprayed saliva over her right shoulder, nearly hitting her bassist, Tony Shanahan, standing four feet away. During the heavier songs, Smith prowled around the stage like an animal, letting Kaye’s explosive guitar riffs pulsate throughout her body. At one point there was so much fierce tension onstage between singer and guitarist that a fire seemed to erupt from their knees, as they kept bending back and forth towards each other in a frenzy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At other times, Smith displayed a feminine flirtiness. During “Pumping (My Heart),” she climbed towards the drum kit, playfully waving her body in front of drummer of 40 years Jay Dee Daugherty. Her dancing ranged from the feistiness of an angsty teenage boy to the slow, fleshy movements of a woman seducing her lover. “She danced as if she was a 50s back up dancer with an up-do and a miniskirt, and it honestly made me want to take my clothes off,” said fourth-year English major Natalie O’Brien, who paused a second before adding, “I think I’m in love with a woman.”</p>\n<p>While she undoubtedly had enormous sex appeal, Smith also exuded a mother-like warmth throughout the venue. Gracious and humble, she never tried to out-do her band. Instead, she showed support and love, visibly encouraging them to jam harder and slipping into the audience and the side of the stage to observe the whole scene.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just the band that felt the warmth; the whole of Granada felt the golden honey cover their bodies and melt away the stresses of tomorrow. Her love for her fans was evident when she trotted through the aisles, holding hands of people who reached for her and receiving hugs and kisses with a smile.</p>\n<p>Linda Benet, a faculty member of SBCC, saw Smith at festivals in the mid-70s, but Tuesday’s show was the first time she saw the rocker perform on a solo bill. “Patti is someone many, many of us seem to trust to take into our psyches perhaps ’cause of her honesty and rawness combined with love,” Benet said.</p>\n<p>This idea of trust resonates especially with those who work closely with Smith. “Her love goes to all people, all people around the world [who] she helps. Patti never had enough food when she was growing up, she never had a toy … she slept in streets. These experiences made her warm,” said Yuki Burns, Smith’s personal assistant, in a conversation after the show. A peppy Japanese lady, Burns has worked with Smith for over 15 years, and handed out prized set lists in Smith’s handwriting to anyone who wanted it.</p>\n<p>Another thing about the lady rocker is that she’s got no shortage of wit. During an improvised rendition of “My Blakean Year,” she stopped the poetry on a line about Ethel Barrymore to rant about John Barrymore being a black sheep and how humans give pigs a bad name. A natural performer, she maintained a lively conversation with the audience throughout the entire show. “Wing!” a man in row Y shouted, referencing a song from <em>Gone Again</em>. “Oh we’re not doing that one,” she answered, but then went into a cappella on the chorus. It was rough around the edges, but her spirit was there and claps ensued afterward. “Sang a little flat, but it was for him, so,” she winked towards the back row.</p>\n<p>Songs were sung in memory of Amy Winehouse, Monty Brown and Fred “Sonic” Smith, the last of whom is her late husband. “I wrote the words of this song for my boyfriend in 1978 … He became my husband, the father of my children and though he is departed, we think of him always. When I sing the words of this song, it is as if it were the first time,” she said, slowing her voice to annunciate “first” and “time” as separate units. “Because the Night” followed this sweet introduction.</p>\n<p>A second tender moment came when she told the story of how The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun” was the first song she hit all the notes to when she was 16. “Eric Burdon and the Animals … were for us, they were for the disenfranchised, the mavericks, the black sheep, maybe they were for John Barrymore. I say this because tonight we all got to meet Eric and I didn’t get to express this little story to him … I am singing today because I hit all the notes.”</p>\n<p>But the best part of the night came when Smith began the poetry of “Gandhi.” Pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose and reading off two sheets of paper stapled together, she started off slow, so slow one could’ve been lulled to sleep.</p>\n<p>Then came the thunder, the firepower that gets unleashed when Smith gets in the groove. Over the course of eight minutes, she threw the paper down, shoved her glasses into the blazer, spat over her shoulder three times and knocked over the mic stand twice. The song pulled and pulsed, the build moving gradually until all of Granada was about to explode with a carnal euphoria.</p>\n<p>In a moment that went unnoticed by the frontwoman, a man sitting in row P behind a couple sharing binoculars smiled to himself. “Nobody does a build like Patti Smith,” he announced out loud. “Nobody.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;

and primary songwriter for Steppenwolf, took the stage on Friday night at SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club before being joined by the night’s main performers, The Dirty Knobs.</p>\n<p>Known for hits such as “Born to Be Wild” and “Magic Carpet Ride,” Steppenwolf achieved worldwide recognition in the late 1960s before breaking up in 1972 and then on-and-off reuniting through the years. Although he often performs with a backing band, John Kay, a Santa Barbara resident, is now the only original member of the group.</p>\n<p>Kay opened the night solo, playing blues songs from his “rambling days” before Steppenwolf. Using his instantly recognizable slide guitar style and switching between acoustic and steel guitars, the musician told stories from his life to provide context for each song. During this set, the general admission audience crowded together near the doorway to see from behind those still eating dinner in front of the stage. SOhO staff also maintained a no-talking policy, but that did not stop some of the more enthusiastic audience members from yelling the occasional “You rock, John Kay!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Any ability to enforce the rule went out the window when The Dirty Knobs walked onstage and joined in midway through “The Pusher,” turning the quiet, but passionate song into a booming, energetic spectacle. Using every inch of space available to them, the crowd danced, shouted and sang along with whatever words they knew. Kay proceeded with “Sookie Sookie” and “Magic Carpet Ride,” ending with a long, aggressive performance of “Born to Be Wild.” He somehow preserved all the roughness and energy of the original recording with some to spare.</p>\n<p>After staff cleared the tables and perfected sound levels, The Dirty Knobs returned sans Kay with their own set list to carry out the night. The Knobs, regulars of SOhO, are generally considered a side project of Mike Campbell, lead guitarist for Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers. But on Friday, the band was also joined by Ron Blair (who replaced regular bassist Lance “Crawdaddy” Morrison currently on tour with Don Henley) and keyboardist Benmont Tench, both original members of The Heartbreaker.</p>\n<p>On Tench’s inclusion, Campbell said he was eager to play with Kay, but did not realize until after he took the gig that they would need a keyboardist. “You can’t play Steppenwolf without that fucking organ. And there’s only one guy I know up to the challenge,” Campbell said.</p>\n<p>The band performed an eclectic list of cover songs, from Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates’ frequently covered “Shakin’ All Over” to The Kinks’ relatively unknown “Apeman.” Seventy-nine on <em>Rolling Stones’</em> 100 Greatest Guitarists list, Campbell proved that legendary guitarists can afford to be generous, and made a point to give every band member a chance in the spotlight. At one point, he invited the group’s roadie, known simply as Chinner, to play lead guitar on a song.</p>\n<p>In addition to improv solos from Blair and Tench, rhythm guitarist Jason “Ape” Sinay traded lead parts with Campbell, and drummer Matt “Swampfox” Laug played complicated fills, while Campbell frequently directed the crowd’s attention to him as if a proud mother. With the exception of Tench, every band member also sang on at least one song.</p>\n<p>By the end of their set list, the audience was chanting “Dirty Knobs” until the band reemerged for their own rendition of the Jimi-Hendrix-popularized “Hey Joe” with an intro featuring segments of “1983.” Their extended, over-driven and no-holds-barred version of the song put the members’ true skill and cohesion on display. Campbell demonstrated much of the speed, agility and overall guitar mastery of Hendrix, with fewer of the show-off-y riffs.</p>\n<p>As the crowd thinned out, the members walked around the club, speaking with fans and posing for pictures. Laug said the night exceeded his expectations, and that playing with other artists is his favorite aspect of performing live.</p>\n<p>“Tonight was one of the better gigs ever. It was amazing,” he said. “We don’t get that much [interaction between live musicians] these days. Because of the technology, everybody can do everything on the computer by themselves. It’s nowhere near human interaction.”</p>\n<p>He explained that the band only met John Kay for the first time shortly before the show, and that it only took a few minutes to prepare.</p>\n<p>“You know, the songs are radio staples, you hear ‘em everyday almost,” Laug said. “I listen to the radio, I think I know how it goes; just get up there and rock it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60519\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60519\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/john-kay-and-dirty-knobs-rock-out-in-soho/","id":7004,"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky"},"related":[7003,7002,7001],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"RL Grime Creates Turbulence at Sold-Out Velvet Jones Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RLGrime-Credit-Andie-Elloway.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RLGrime-Credit-Andie-Elloway.jpg?resize=479%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Squeezing my way into a crowd of sweaty college students and post-adolescents, I was captivated by the tall silhouette that appeared on the stage of the completely sold-out Velvet Jones.

With people staggered from wall to wall without an inch of space left, all eyes were fixated on the figure that stood before us. A flickering hue of purple shined onstage, outlining a crooked snapback and slim physique. With the music slowly rising in volume and the audience bustling with an intense roar of excitement, the artist grabbed the mic and declared “I go by the name of RL Grime. Santa Barbara let me see those hands!” The bass dropped.</p>\n<p>24-year-old Henry Steinway, otherwise known by his stage name, RL Grime, is a popular electronic artist and producer from Los Angeles, CA. Famous for his addictive mixture of both electronic dance music and hip hop-sampled trap, RL Grime is a favored artist in the EDM-infatuated culture of our generation. So it’s no surprise that the entirety of his nationwide Void Tour, which kicked off in October, has been a major success. Santa Barbara welcomed him with open arms this past Thursday, Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>RL Grime is part of WeDidIt Collective, which includes artists such as Shlohmo and Ryan Hemsworth. His entrancing original tunes and stimulating remixes have gotten millions of plays on SoundCloud. The list includes originals such as “Tell Me” and “Core” and remixes of Big Sean’s “Kingpin” and Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa.” His 2008 EP <em>High Beams</em> debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Electronic chart and at No. 8 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums chart. <em>Void</em>, his 2014 debut studio album, is just another step towards the artist’s growing world of electronic possibilities. It seems that no matter how the L.A. native chooses to demonstrate his musical talents, his devoted fan base continues to expand.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Presented by REDEYE and EPIC events, Velvet Jones became the destination for hundreds of EDM lovers. Tommy Kruise and Lunice warmed up the venue with their refreshing hip hop remixes, pumping up everyone for the sold-out night. When RL Grime finally hit the stage, college students who were otherwise stressed with papers and midterms filled with nothing but happiness and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>The young artist remained stationed behind his elevated podium, giving off a mysterious vibe throughout the set. The lighting primarily came from behind, casting a dark shadow over him to set off the vibrant shades of red, green and purple. In rare moments, a light shined directly onto RL Grime, exposing his zealous expression and intriguing appearance. In front of his wide podium was the shape of a gravestone — the iconic symbol of the WeDidIt collective.</p>\n<p>“Scylla,” a <em>Void </em>favorite, opened the set. Instead of easing the crowd into some of his more regularly rhythm beats, RL Grime jumped right into the good stuff — the type of “good stuff” that everyone came to see him for. “Scylla” was perfect for this, stunning the audience with enrapturing beats and base drops that cast a rebellious spell over everyone. Its lower-toned attributes and fast-paced theme created a turbulent atmosphere which translated into a vicious monster-fighting scene in a film. Velvet Jones exploded with pandemonium.</p>\n<p>RL Grime continued to bless the crowd with mind-blowing bass drops, hip hop snippets and trap vibrations. Songs such as “Core” and “Heard Me” set the venue on fire. People began crowd-surfing and standing on the ledges along the edges of Velvet Jones, and the intensity of the bass shaking the walls increased everyone’s fervor. Remixes of Beyonce’s “711,” YG’s “My Ni**a,” Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa” and TNGHT’s “Acrylics” created extreme devoutness to the music. RL Grime truly has a way of making an audience feel invincible.</p>\n<p>With a set that lasted over an hour and a half, RL Grime did not let his devotees down for a single second. Towards the end, he came out from behind his podium and made his way to the front of the stage, announcing that he had one more song in store before the end of the night. As he made his way back behind the podium, the beginning of “Tell Me” started playing and everyone knew that the best part of the night was about to happen. As the music built up and the bass was about to drop, RL Grime counted down from three and Velvet Jones erupted one last time. He added in an interesting remix of the tune before once again playing the beloved and well-known drop for which the L.A. native is known. As I headed home, the strong melody still rang in my ears.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60640\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60640\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/","id":7005,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7004,7003,7002],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
