When the doors opened, attendees were met with the daunting, yet serious tone of Tupac’s “Hail Mary.” The playlist that replaced a DJ continued with tracks that were not as energetic as one would anticipate for a concert. Such tunes included ASAP Ferg’s hardcore “Fuck Out My Face” and Travis Scott’s “Mamacita.” By the time Future’s captivating “Commas” single came into rotation, concertgoers were content with swaying to the beat and keeping their eyes glued to the screens of their gadgets, for there was no DJ to encourage them to go crazy.</p>\n<p>Ready to spin the night in a better direction, opener, Chayetione, came with rhymes, a flow and jokes to please the crowd. The Santa Barbara native entertained as he admitted, “I don’t have a DJ right now, ‘cause I’m low budget.” He concluded, “but, I do have an iPod shuffle.” As his reliance on the iPod suggested, his set was not in any particularly preplanned order. Instead, he rapped on the fly as the beat to each track echoed throughout the venue, unbeknownst to him since the screen to his iPod was cracked. In fact, his ability to adapt to each song within seconds made his set engaging and intriguing. Concertgoers chuckled as Chayetione vocalized his approval and excitement of each of the surprise songs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lyricist bounced around the stage as he spewed out lyrics with his old-school flow. Chayetione sought to uplift and inspire with tracks like “Life,” “Hate Down Peace Up” and “Dream,” which he wrote when living out of his car in Los Angeles two years ago. His beats and flow echoed rappers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, proving that Mos Def, Common, and Talib Kweli are indeed amongst his greatest rap inspirations.</p>\n<p>The buzz Chayetione manage to invoke amongst the crowd fizzled as soon as it developed. As he ended his set with a Mr. Carmack sample, students had to endure another wave of mundane songs, occasionally alternated with tracks by Future and Schoolboy Q, from the infamous inconsistent playlist as they awaited the man of the night.</p>\n<p>Unaware and unconcerned with the rollercoaster of emotions the audience had endured, Vince Staples burst on the stage at 10:03 to “Lift Me Up,” fully equipped with the energy necessary to lift fans up out of their funk. After stomping all over the stage in his high top Converse, the rapper paused to advocate for homework over concerts and relay hi amazement at the fact that there is a Panda Express on campus. The Long Beach representative cut back into his set with “65 Hunnid,” before opting to perform the latter part of the track without its accompanying instrumental.</p>\n<p>A far cry from their behavior earlier in the evening, audience members grew rowdy throughout Staples’ set. As the 22 year old continued with tracks “Dopeman” and “Hang ‘N’ Bang” from his debut album <em>Summertime ’06</em>, the crowd grew just as wild as the performer with their nonstop pushing and shoving. Although the Norf Norf emcee produced such excitement from the onlookers, they grew irritated with his various monologues – ranging from his frustration towards his photographer/videographer to a rant on pregnancy. In fact, students begin to evacuate the Hub and save their self from the endless jokes and rants.</p>\n<p>Although the show fell somewhere in between a failed Chris Tucker standup comedy skit and a rap concert, those who stuck out the rambling won performances of fan-favorites. The instant Vince rapped the first bar to “Norf Norf,” second-year, Derrick Duren exclaimed, “Finally!” before slithering his way to the front row. The crowd chanted the lyrics “I ain’t never ran from nothing but the police,” although the bulk of the crowd has probably never had to dodge such police encounters.</p>\n<p>Staples concluded the show with first-year Vanessa Ayala’s favorite song, “Blue Suede.” In spite of the new invasive privacy policy, the Snapchat app was plastered on every cell phone in hopes of capturing the “Blue Suede” performance. Ayala shared her appreciation for A.S. Board Program noting, “it’s really dope, cause it’s at my school, I was super hyped.”</p>\n<p>In spite of the mediocre DJ-replacement playlist and excessive talking from Staples, concertgoers left the Hub in decent spirits. To hear more from the chatty rapper, <em>Summertime ’06</em> is available on iTunes and Chayetione’s nostalgic tracks can be found on his self-titled soundcloud.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mb6Jc4juSF8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/","id":6861,"author":{"id":719,"name":"Nisa Smith"},"related":[6860,6859,6858],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":719,"name":"Nisa Smith","biography":"Not available","articles":[6743,6745,6800,6861,6884,6890,6900,6910,6933,6935,6965],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Blitzen Trapper: a Socially Acceptable Country Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/btlizen-trapper.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/btlizen-trapper.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"There I stood, a beacon of teenage streetwear among a sea of 20-somethings in flannels.

The crowd to see Blitzen Trapper on the night of Veterans Day at SOhO was not a varied bunch. The band took the stage at just after 9 p.m., drawing in the white folks from all corners of the venue. Eventually the crowd reached a decent size, especially considering it was a Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper wasted little time on the formalities of crowd interaction. When asked by lead singer Eric Earley how they were doing, the crowd responded with a surprisingly enthusiastic “Wooo!” Earley and I were both taken aback. “Not bad for a Wednesday night,” he mused, appreciative of the energy of the relatively small audience.</p>\n<p>The five-piece jumped straight into the tunes and sounded undeniably tight. Earley’s voice neither cracked nor faltered, carrying over an audience which hung on his every lyric. Drummer Brian Adrian Koch perfectly propelled the band forward, a metronome who knew how to have fun. The group has been together for well over a decade, and it was obvious in their performance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Every band member clearly loved playing together on stage, and everyone in the audience loved being there to experience it. Guys nodded their heads and rocked to and fro. Girls swayed around, doing the appropriate corny dance, reminiscent of a Peanuts character. There were some die-hard fans who knew every lyric and sang along with Earley, and others who attempted to sit still and objectively analyze the musicianship, no doubt there for some sort of writing assignment.</p>\n<p>They played 25 or 30 minutes straight, their set mainly consisting of similar-sounding songs. One of their high points was not even one of their songs. They covered “Come Together” by the Beatles, instilling it with a hard American groove that the boys from across the pond never could. That number was impossibly danceable, and even the least country of us there couldn’t resist getting down with it.</p>\n<p>This first set of songs ranged from sounding like Neil Young to Lynyrd Skynyrd, eventually ending with another hard rock song, one of their own called “Fletcher.” It was at this point I realized I was enjoying myself, because I was disappointed to see them leave the stage so soon.</p>\n<p>The band wasn’t actually done — maybe just testing audience reception or regrouping backstage. Before long three of the five guys walked back on stage. The drummer, lead singer and keyboardist took control of the stage, but the tone was suddenly different. Koch the drummer took to a microphone, and the keyboardist opted for a natural piano sound. The trio played through a few ballads, lush with harmony and soothing instrumentation.</p>\n<p>Soon the bassist and rhythm guitarist were ready to rejoin the stage, and the reunited Blitzen Trapper played two finale songs. First they played their biggest hit to date, a song called “Furr” from their 2007 album of the same name. Immediately the crowd roared, then sang along with every word, creating a chorus much larger than seemed possible.</p>\n<p>Finally the band closed with another groovy tune, one called “All Across This Land,” from their newest album also of the same name. This song is ripe with syncopation and distorted guitar riffs. The crowd’s energy peaked as the whole place rocked and rolled with the band. Couples danced, Blitzen Trapper jammed out and smiled, dudes threw up Metal Horns half ironically, girls did that dance where they look at each other and flip their hair around. It was a grand ol’ time that unfortunately came to an end.</p>\n<p>It was only after seeing them live that one really gets to realize where Blitzen Trapper sits in the makeup of the music scene. If you ask a Blitzen Trapper fan to classify their music, the fan says “rock” or “folk.” However, if you played Blitzen Trapper for someone who hadn’t heard it before, most wouldn’t hesitate to call it country. The conclusion is this: Blitzen Trapper provides those who refuse to like country music with a taste of what they’re missing out on.</p>\n<p>Trying to classify Blitzen Trapper is difficult and ultimately futile. They put on an energetic, lively show that was more enjoyable than one would expect. While they can’t be pigeonholed into the labels “country” or “folk” or “rock,” Blitzen Trapper put on a damn good show that ended up being a lot of fun.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66574\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66574\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/","id":6858,"author":{"id":728,"name":"Joey Goodman"},"related":[6857,6856,6855],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"TOKiMONSTA Wows SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tokimonsta_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tokimonsta_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage was set and waiting for world-renowned DJ TOKiMONSTA, to bring SOhO’s quaint, dimly lit room to life last Thursday night.

Soft background music created a tranquil ambiance while people freshened up their drinks, engaged in small talk and swayed along to the beat. It was the calm before the storm.</p>\n<p>The attendees of this sold-out show trickled in from every walk of life. Literally. Checkered Vans-wearing undergrads, oxford-sporting graduate students, laid-back locals in flip flops, and frequent club-goers in stilettos all made their marks on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>As the clock approached 9:00, individual groups of minglers quickly morphed into an antsy crowd in anticipation of the opening act. Thanks to SOhO’s intimate setting, dodging elbows to the face in hopes of securing artist visibility was a non-issue, unlike in most general admission venues. Any spot at SOhO is a good spot.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So, 9:15 passed. Ok, no big deal. Artists run late all the time.</p>\n<p>Then 9:30 passed.</p>\n<p>By 9:45, the storm began to brew.</p>\n<p>The previously nonthreatening crowd became rambunctious. Drinks were spilled. Chatter was thunderous, and mile-high platform heels turned their owners into mere puddles on the floor.</p>\n<p>Finally, an hour later, Leikeli47 appeared sporting her signature mask and an unapologetic New York attitude. The instant she made her entrance, a surge of bone rattling bass vibrated the room so hard that it is a wonder SOhO still has a second floor. At this point in the night, the crowd was ready to respond to any stimulus, so when Leikeli47 demanded that everybody “clap [their] fucking hands,” you can bet everyone responded obediently regardless of how they felt about the performance. For example, even the middle-aged woman who so eloquently voiced her opinion by shouting, “This shit sucks!” could not resist bouncing along to the bass’s heavy beats.</p>\n<p>Leikeli47’s abrasive raps lacked substance overall, but her exceptionally repetitive and simplistic lyrics had the crowd chanting along to the previously unfamiliar songs. Therefore, although the New Yorker’s vibe was out of place in laid-back Santa Barbara, she did manage to temporarily satiate the small but mighty crowd’s unruly energy.</p>\n<p>Within minutes of the opening act’s departure, a petite girl, who was barely visible under the shadow of a wide brimmed black hat, took her place on the stage. With no introduction necessary, Jennifer Lee (alias TOKiMONSTA) kicked off the third show of her nationwide Fovere tour with a charged-up rendition of Lupe Fiasco’s “Kick Push,” to which the crowd went wild.</p>\n<p>Lee’s hypnotic visuals and pulsing, euphoric beats turned charming SOhO into an elated dance club complete with attendees busting out interpretive, jellyfish-like moves which mimicked Lee’s melodic whimsy. Who else creates a mix of “The Next Episode” and “Hypnotize,” then jumps a decade and transitions to Tinashe’s “2 On,” cuts to “Bitch Better Have My Money” and ends the rollercoaster montage with some Kendrick Lamar?</p>\n<p>While original remixes seemed to be the crowd favorites, die-hard fans like Jessica, a fourth-year UCSB sociology major, were most excited to hear tracks from TOKi’s older albums. However, judging by the lack of familiarity that many attendees had with TOKiMONSTA’s original songs like “Realla” and “Go With It,” one could assume that the majority of this crowd came curious to discover new music. They were not disappointed.</p>\n<p>Lee enjoyed her time on stage almost as much as her audience enjoyed her performance. In the middle of her set, TOKi smirked and addressed the crowd for the first time to say, “I hope you guys like this Spanish version of ‘Hotline Bling,’ because I personally think it’s better than the original.” She later toyed with the audience by pretending her set was over. After a chorus of encores, Lee ran back out and said, “Ok maybe one more.” That one more song turned into two more and then three more until she ended with a bass pounding remix of “Shabba” and “Bugatti” that tore the roof off of SOhO.</p>\n<p>Lee’s inherent charm and knack for mixing things, as she puts it, “that are really chill and really angry and obscure” turned everyone into a fan of the “bunny monster” by the end of the night. Plus, she gets extra points for playing some Spanish Drake.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was a very well spent Thursday night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/","id":6859,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6858,6857,6856],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Firebrand Brings the Revolution to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/firebrtand.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/firebrtand.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  A smattering of hippies, punks and social anarchists drifted into SOhO and mulled about, chatting about protests past and perusing collectivist literature.

Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) and Ryan Harvey (Riot-Folk Collective) began Firebrand after discussing their mutual desire for a politicized record label. On Monday, Harvey and Firebrand’s roster of newly-signed artists visited Santa Barbara to showcase their music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before the show, musicians mingled with activists and attendees. Organizers and fans touted the evils of racism and corporatism while drinking beers in the dimly lit restaurant. The vibe encompassed the mood of a punk concert, a coffee shop full of grumbling radicals and a rally against the World Trade Organization all in one. Attendees and artists browsed the Bonfire’s piles of zines, with names ranging from <em>Build Your Own Solidarity Network</em> to <em>Alternatives to Police</em>.</p>\n<p>Lia Rose of Built for the Sea opened the show. Unfortunately due to illness, Daniel Mackenzie, the other member of Built for the Sea, could not play. Rose stoically adapted her set to that of a solo act, strumming alternative-rock and folk music. The act undoubtedly lost some of the band’s more unique influences without Mackenzie’s instrumentals. With just a guitar and her voice, Rose appeared to be a version of the indie-songstress we’ve all heard at open mic nights. Fortunately she sang and played like the best possible version of that familiar image. Rose reminds us why only a few people get to be professional singers. Harvey energetically endorsed his fellow musician with the perfect description while on stage: “Her voice sounds like it’s auto-tuned but it’s not — it’s just perfect.”</p>\n<p>Harvey himself took the stage next, accompanied by English-born Kareem Samara. Samara plucked away on a Middle Eastern stringed instrument called the oud, while Harvey belted out familiar folk-protest sounds. The duo began with “Light in the Morning,” a song especially memorable for its surprising and poetic story. “Light in the Morning” described protestors rallying in Ferguson, Greece, Egypt, Turkey and Palestine, and how all of them were tear-gassed with the same type of canisters from the exact same tear-gas company. Harvey emphasized how these disparate groups of people around the world were brought together from this shocking coincidence. Harvey continued his stream of polemical protest songs. The act covered topics like the crisis facing Syrian refugees in “Omar” and the struggle of Kurdish forces against ISIS with “Rojhava.” An audience member, Jake “Pitstop” Roozen, gave his reason for coming to see Harvey. “Crawling out of my tent at Occupy Honolulu, listening to him gave me the little bit of hope I needed to keep going,” said Roozen.</p>\n<p>Following Harvey, solo act Bell’s Roar played a blend of signature soul-influenced electronic music. Sean Desiree drums, plays base, plays guitar and produces all of her own music for Bell’s Roar. She began her act by turning on her computer and playing the music she composed before spinning into a dance on stage. Desiree twirled and spun with lithe, acrobatic movements. For a few moments no one played anything as she danced to her own music. She broke the spell and began to sing. Desiree’s set covered a range of political topics. From the stage she described her recent travels touring in the Midwest and the cultural anxiety there surrounding people of color and others not following conventional gender norms. Before one song, Desiree called out “I try to call on my ancestors.” She also emphasized the Black Lives Matter movement with her song “Black Lives.” Most of all Desiree embodies movement. By her third song she stepped down from the stage and danced with the audience members. Desiree was kind enough to speak with the <em>Nexus</em>. “It’s about connecting with people. When you’re on stage there’s this barrier,” Desiree said.</p>\n<p>Finally The Last Internationale closed out the show. Delila Paz and Edgey Pires, the duo that comprises the band, broadcast total punk energy. On stage they jolted and jumped in tandem with the harder guitar sensibilities of their rebel rock. Each gives the impression of someone who would tell you as an adolescent that you should stick it to the man or fight the power. One song, “1968,” took its name from the French revolution of the same year. Introducing the song, Pires told the audience about the graffiti that inspired it. The graffiti, from the Sorbonne at the former University of Paris, reads, “The more I make love, the more I want to make revolution. The more I make revolution, the more I want to make love.” The slogan suited The Last Internationale’s ethos perfectly. By the time the harder punk sounds blasted from the stage, a larger crowd had accumulated next to it. “1968” ended the show, but by that time everyone was standing and rocking out.</p>\n<p>The way the musicians spoke about each other united them. They spoke about finding community with the other artists of Firebrand. Lia Rose, who also spoke with the <em>Nexus</em>, put it poignantly. “I found this family,” said Rose. From on stage, Harvey described Firebrand as more of an activist collective than a record label. All indications from the show say the same. Firebrand began in June and only has higher to rise. As long as Harvey and Morello sign artists who have messages they care about, their label has only success ahead.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/firebrand-brings-the-revolution-to-soho/","id":6860,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6859,6858,6857],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
