A court date has been set for Sept. 15 of this year. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The parents of UC Santa Barbara students James Hong and David Wang — the shooter’s roommates — and their friend, George Chen, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in March 2015 against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Capri Apartments, arguing that their deaths could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>While the Sheriff’s Department has been dropped from the lawsuit, Hi Desert Mobile Home Park L.P., the company that owns Capri Apartments, and Asset Campus Housing (ACH), a third-party student housing property management company, are still on the lawsuit and will face trial on Sept. 15.</p>\n<p>The defendants submitted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but it was rejected this year on Feb. 10.</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, the two L.A.-based law firms representing the victims’ parents, claimed negligence and wrongful death against the two companies, which they believe should have properly vetted Elliot Rodger before assigning him to be Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>According to court documents obtained by the Nexus, the parents’ original complaint against the two companies alleged Capri Apartments was warned Rodger was a “violent and dangerous threat to his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Allegedly, the apartment company “had actual and constructive knowledge of his bizarre behavior,” yet still did not conduct a “reasonable investigation” before assigning him as Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>“Plaintiffs are informed and believe that [the two companies], through their on-site management personnel, were aware that law enforcement officers had come to Apt. #7 due to a dispute between Rodger and his roommates,” according to the original 2015 complaint.</p>\n<p>The complaint says as a result of the two companies’ “negligence,” Hong, Wang and Chen were “rendered completely vulnerable” to Rodger and “subjected to his violent acts, which caused their deaths.”</p>\n<p>The families are suing for any psychological, emotional or physical pain caused by the deaths of the three victims and are seeking compensation as “the Court deems just and proper.”</p>\n<p>“[The parents of Chen, Hong and Wang] have incurred funeral and burial expenses and suffered extreme and severe distress, pain, anguish and other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Hong and Wang were assigned to Apt. #7 at Capri Apartments of Seville Road in September 2013 despite several complaints from Rodger’s old roommates about his mental well-being.</p>\n<p>In late 2011, Rodger was assigned two Hispanic male roommates who he said were “rowdy, inferior, pig-faced thugs,” according to his manifesto. Within days of meeting them, he insulted them and told them he was “superior,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>In September of 2011, Rodger was assigned a new roommate who, a few months later, “began to fear for his personal safety,” according to the complaint the parents’ lawyers filed.</p>\n<p>According to the roommate’s complaint to the apartment complex, “Living with Eliot [sic] is like living with a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and the only way to solve this problem is by removing it. We are at the point where I fear for my safety.”</p>\n<p>The parents’ lawyers claim in a Feb. 10, 2017, court document that the three victims “simply would not have been killed” if the companies had complied with “basic industry standards and at a reasonable level of care.”</p>\n<p>A representative from Capri Apartments said they were uncomfortable commenting on the case but could say “the management company has changed since 2014.”</p>\n<p>Patrick McNicholas, partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, said “the apartment was completely lacking in training its onsite managers in issues of safety, on issues of matching roommates, in issues making sure that the roommates were safe.”</p>\n<p>“The parents are very hopeful their children will not have died in vain,” he said.</p>\n<p>McNicholas also said the parents hope companies with similar business models will take student safety seriously and implement proper policies and procedures to prevent similar events.</p>\n<p>“They’re moving forward with their lives, but they are beyond devastated,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, May 25, 2017, edition of

fiscal year with a $1.4 million deficit, 49 vacant positions and over $6 million spent in overtime expenses.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County officials met this Tuesday to discuss a quarterly report of the county budget. Of the 68 departments, 65 are positive or at budget.</p>\n<p>The county executive office (CEO) and auditor-controller presented a report of the third quarter of the fiscal year at Tuesday’s board of supervisors meeting, revealing that the Sheriff’s Office is projected to reach a deficit of $1.4 million by the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Despite what might seem to be a daunting figure, the county is projected to end the fiscal year with a net increase of $750,000 in their general fund.</p>\n<p>SBSO’s deficit is an example of some of the fiscal challenges the county is facing this year. The county is expected to reach an approximate $35 million deficit if it continues to operate at this level of expenditure and has been re-balancing its budget for the next fiscal year to prevent funding issues.</p>\n<p>Following budget workshops with the county Board of Supervisors in April, the CEO is expected to release its proposed budget for the next fiscal year next Thursday. The Board of Supervisors will then hold its budget hearings on June 12, during which the public is welcome to comment on the final budget. If necessary, the hearings will continue on June 14 and 16.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate any potential budget issues, county officials have proposed 5 percent budget cuts across all departments.</p>\n<p>SBSO is facing a possible reduction of nine full-time positions in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), though Undersheriff Bernard Melekian has spoken to the board in favor of keeping the positions during last month’s budget workshop meetings.</p>\n<p>According to documents outlining the proposed cuts’ fiscal impact, reductions to the IVFP alone would bring approximately $1.9 million to the county’s general fund. These reductions would include removing three sergeants, two special duty deputies and four deputies, as well as reducing overtime pay.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, Isla Vista is the only station in the county that is not operating “at minimum staffing,” meaning there will likely be cuts in this area to balance the department’s finances.</p>\n<p>“As a result, we proposed a significant reduction in our staffing levels at the IVFP. We are in discussions with the CEO’s Office and University representatives, and at this point nothing has been decided as of yet,” Hoover said in an email.</p>\n<p>IVFP is not the only section of SBSO that would see cuts. The proposed cuts for SBSO in the next fiscal year total approximately $7.6 million.</p>\n<p>While these cuts were proposed at the budget workshops in April, none of the reductions have been finalized. They will go through public hearings before they are adopted.</p>\n<p>Each county department’s presentation during last month’s budget workshops included a section for departments to request a restoration or expansion of programs slated to be cut.</p>\n<p>In Melekian’s presentation, he said IVFP is a “critical” part of SBSO’s budget priorities but acknowledged that the department is facing issues when it comes to staffing, updating technology and funding.</p>\n<p>Melekian said the department’s equipment is outdated. The department is working on updating their computerized dispatch system as well as their jail management system — which will be operational in November — but he said the records management system remains out of date.</p>\n<p>According to Melekian, SBSO also needs new portable radios and car systems. The department does not proactively replace equipment but rather rushes to gather funding when old equipment fails to function.</p>\n<p>In addition to outdated technology, SBSO currently has 49 total vacancies in its stations, causing employees to work overtime. As a result, SBSO has had massive overtime expenses totaling $6.4 million for this fiscal year, offset partially by $5.4 million in salaries and benefits savings, according to a board letter from Tuesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>According to the letter from the board of supervisors, “Further exacerbating the vacancy issue, an additional 17 patrol deputies and 12 custody deputies were on worker’s compensation leave, who not only continue to draw salary, but also create vacancies that are often covered with overtime.”</p>\n<p>The board anticipates that if the department ends the year with negative net financial impact, it will need to use the general fund to balance its deficit.</p>\n<p>“This assumption has already been factored into the projected year-end net positive variance of $750 thousand in the general fund,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The county will make their final decisions regarding the budget in June.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the

Hong, Christopher Michaels-Martinez, David Wang and Veronika Weiss, who lost their lives three years ago in the mass murder that left another 14 injured and countless Isla Vista residents impacted. This year’s graduating seniors will be the last class that attended UC Santa Barbara at the time of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>Many of the victims’ parents were present at the memorial vigil, including the mother of George Chen, Kelly Wang. She said the memory of her son continues to be a “heart-wrenching pain,” but despite the overwhelming sadness, the thought of his kindness has inspired her to “follow the call to serve others” and “discover new meanings” in her own life.</p>\n<p>“In many sleepless nights, I looked at George’s photo, touched his beautiful face with my fingers and I asked myself, ‘What can I do for you George? Is there anything in the world that I can ever do for you?’” Wang said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78088\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78088\" data-attachment-id=\"78088\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-23/over-200-gather-for-memorial-vigil/candlelight-vigil-by-jenny-luo-print-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Candlelight Vigil by Jenny Luo PRINT-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78088\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Candlelight-Vigil-by-Jenny-Luo-PRINT-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78088\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“In the silence, I heard a soft little voice came from my own heart.

id=\"caption-attachment-78246\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Over 40 people were in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting, with several people voicing their concerns about the way law enforcement deals with cases.</p>\n<p>The town hall began with a description of the CSD and its powers. Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the bill that established the I.V. CSD, allows the district to provide eight specific services, including the ability to “contract” with the county and the UC Regents for “additional police protection services.”</p>\n<p>The CSD’s board is looking to exercise that power to improve public safety, as the amount of reported sexual assaults reached 48 this previous year.</p>\n<p>Members of the public took issue with the way law enforcement distributes information about crimes. During public comment, many said they were worried some crimes were not being reported in UC Police Department (UCPD) timely warnings or in the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) press releases.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member Daniel Torres began the public comment with concerns about the way law enforcement chooses to distribute information.</p>\n<p>Torres alluded to a crime reported by SBSO in April, when two male subjects allegedly assaulted a 28-year-old man after making comments about his sexual orientation. The event occurred on Sunday of UC Santa Barbara’s pride week, and while SBSO investigated the incident as a hate crime, it did not release a statement immediately.</p>\n<p>Torres said he wished to see more transparency from local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When you are a part of these communities and people in your community are physically getting assaulted because of their identity, that’s something people need to know about ASAP,” Torres said.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Andrew Pragin expressed his own concern over why he did not receive a timely warning email from UCPD about a stabbing this weekend, which UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson addressed by saying the department does not send timely warnings for every incident in I.V.</p>\n<p>Olson said not all incidents are handled by UCPD because its main jurisdiction is the UC Santa Barbara campus and it is not responsible for patrolling all of the I.V. area. UCPD has a crime log on its website of all the incidents the department responds to, he said.</p>\n<p>“I think some of the misunderstanding is that the UCPD or the campus has this overarching obligation to send out timely warning to the I.V. community, and that’s not always the case,” Olson said.</p>\n<p>In reference to the stabbing, Olson said since there were arrests made and there was no more “ongoing risk” to the public, an additional alert is not recommended.</p>\n<p>“They would frown on us just sending out the alerts under those circumstances,” Olson said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78261\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78261\" data-attachment-id=\"78261\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/img_0835/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0835\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78261\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0835.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>While Olson said additional alerts in these cases are excessive, members of the public express a desire to know more about the process that their cases go through after they are reported to the police.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Batsheva Stoll echoed other speakers’ words on law enforcement transparency.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she and her friends suspected they were being stalked one night in I.V. and reported the incident to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), but she said they did not receive follow-up information about what the authorities were doing to investigate the incident.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she would have liked to know what steps IVFP was taking to investigate the incident and said she believes the public would benefit from understanding the steps law enforcement takes when responding to the public’s concerns.</p>\n<p>“It would be helpful if there was some sort of response system where the person was aware of how it was being dealt with for peace of mind,” Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Among the proposed solutions to the public’s interest in the investigative process was the formation of a civilian review board to internally analyze the work local law enforcement is doing.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann brought into question the way crime is being analyzed, questioning how the law enforcement groups that patrol I.V. are using their data.</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD creates internal reports and discusses strategies to address crime trends at monthly meetings.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve done some bait bike enforcement … We have GPS tracking devices. We certainly see that bike theft is a big issue on campus,” Olson said. “So we do have a number of issues that pop up and we track the data and we look at times and we do deploy officers accordingly.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said while law enforcement agencies are collecting data, the way they currently analyze it leaves room for improvement. She said she met with the County Executive Office to discuss data analysis and found that “internally we don’t do that as well as we should,” and she and believes this is the starting point for addressing crime in I.V.</p>\n<p>CSD board members proposed alternative modes of policing that are intended to be less intimidating than traditional police and would aid in improving public perception of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>The board suggested the expansion of the Community Service Officer (CSO) program currently put in place by UCPD as well as creating a “Student Neighborhood Assistance Program” (S.N.A.P.), both of which work as intermediaries between police and the public.</p>\n<p>According to the board’s presentation on public safety, S.N.A.P. would use student works as “first responders” to noise complaints, which they believe would help deescalate confrontations with police in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78282\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78282\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/csd-holds-first-public-safety-town-hall-meeting/","id":4408,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4407,4406,4405],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
