Clinic Tuesday night hosted by Assemblymember Das Williams’s office to discuss self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Attendees addressed the parking meeting held Monday night, hosted by Santa Barbara County in conjunction with Planning and Public Work staff. Stakeholders scheduled specific topics to be discussed at the following meeting through mid-February.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident and business owner Jay Freeman said he did not like the presentation-oriented structure of the parking meeting. According to Freeman, attendees contested the results of a previous parking survey which found a 15 percent increase in parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was all a power-point presentation format and we all had only three minutes to say what we didn’t like about the parking study,” Freeman said. “Essentially everyone made the argument, ‘well we don’t have any parking spaces even though you found 15 percent parking.’”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdoc said she is concerned about UCSB’s involvement in the suggested parking permit program, and is suspicious the University will push students to pay for campus lots.</p>\n<p>“I feel they have another objective,” Murdoc said. “They want people to pay in their lots or want to make parking expensive enough in Isla Vista that people will use their lots. That concerns me.”</p>\n<p>Field Representative from Williams’ office and UCSB alumnus Cameron Schunk said the SB County Sheriff’s Department will not be responsible for enforcing parking permits in I.V.</p>\n<p>“In our most recent conversation, the Sheriff was not willing to be responsible for the enforcement of a parking permit program in Isla Vista,” Schunk said. “Basically saying we don’t have enough manpower to do it without paying them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65048\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65048\" data-attachment-id=\"65048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444157215\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65048\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Community Organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said issues concerning parking services are complicated.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many different directions we could go with this,” Elliott said. “There’s so many parts of it. There’s permit ideas, parking structures, parking restrictions, coastal access. Everyone has their own vision of what a parking program will look like in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Elliott said she wants to create a subcommittee to tackle issues specific to parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It needs to be a diverse group of people with different representations of various demographics in I.V.,” Elliott said. “The parking program could affect everyone in different ways.”</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, the subcommittee would create a proposal for an I.V. parking program to present to the California Coastal Commission and the community for feedback.</p>\n<p>“They would then present it at a meeting with the Coastal Commission and the community,” Elliott said. “They will be there to give us feedback on the proposal.”</p>\n<p>Elliott also said some I.V. residents are disappointed the recently appointed Community Resource Deputy (CRD), James McKarrel, is monolingual.</p>\n<p>“They said he wouldn’t be able to reach out to Latino communities and that’s part of what the community resource deputy is supposed to do,” Elliott said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65047\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65047\" data-attachment-id=\"65047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444156197\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65047\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Schunk said there are limited options when hiring a CRD, as the S.B.

If approved, the bill will establish the CSD’s formation processes and boundaries and authorize services for I.V., including rent mediation, additional sidewalks and improved lighting.</p>\n<p>Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson presented AB 3 during the Senate session, where the bill passed with a vote of 25-14. Jackson said she and Williams are honored to represent I.V. in its path to self-governance.</p>\n<p>“The current conditions in Isla Vista have reached a breaking point and AB 3 establishes a community services district for providing critical services to the community of Isla Vista which will initially serve as a stepping stone to future stability in that community,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from Williams’ capital office, the assemblymember left Sacramento early Friday morning for Santa Barbara, arriving just in time for the birth of his first child, Ya’Ash Rene Williams. Assemblymember Lorena S. Gonzalez presented AB 3 on the Assembly floor and the passage of the bill moved forward without interruption with a vote of 48-27.</p>\n<p>“Ya’Ash, means Heaven in Navajo. Her middle name also carries a special meaning, as it was is given in honor of Assemblymember Williams’ grandfather, Rene Dietz, a current resident of Ojai,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>AB 3 would require an application to be submitted by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to review the district and place the CSD and a Utility Users Tax (UUT) on the Nov. 2016 general election ballot. The UUT would tax residents a percentage of their utility bills in order to provide funding for the district.</p>\n<p>Williams said I.V. residents have been essential to the bill’s progress during each stage of its development.</p>\n<p>“This has been one of the most community driven bills the legislature has ever seen,” Williams said in a press release. “Everything included in the bill was reviewed during weekly community stakeholder meetings and, after 45 years, Isla Vista will finally have the opportunity to vote on their own governance.”</p>\n<p>Williams’s Chief of Staff Lourdes Jimenez said the large number of residents, students and community leaders involved in the bill’s development demonstrate an environment of open dialogue and positive change.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64710\" style=\"width: 1223px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64710\" data-attachment-id=\"64710\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/ab3_by-eric-swenson-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=1213%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1213,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB3_by Eric Swenson-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64710 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"If passed, AB3 will promote stability where it is currently lacking in the Isla Vista community.

Clinic Building at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p>“With AB 3 on the Governor’s desk, it’s of the utmost importance that we have a strong showing of community support for the bill,” Jimenez said in an email. “This means that we are looking to community members to write an email to the governor, send a letter, and/or to call his office and let him know how important this legislation is for the community.”</p>\n<p>Jimenez said one of the key parts of the IVCSD is it allows Isla Vista residents to be directly involved in local government.</p>\n<p>“Residents within the District’s boundaries will have the opportunity to run for one of five elected positions on the Board of Directors,” Jimenez said in an email. “In addition to this direct involvement with a future district, residents will have the opportunity to volunteer with the District and participate in any programs that a future Board of Directors decides to spearhead.</p>\n<p>According to Jimenez, the bill’s passage through the California Legislature has been “empowering,” but work still remains to be done if Governor Brown passes AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Once the bill is chaptered into law, a community-driven campaign is needed to pass the IVCSD during the November 2016 election,” Jimenez said in an email. “Much like our success at the Governor’s desk is dependent on community engagement and support, the IVCSD’s success at the ballot will depend on Isla Vistans turning out to vote and informing one another about the benefits of local representation and self-governance.”</p>\n<p><em>Letters to the Governor can be sent to:</em><br>\n<em> Honorable Jerry Brown</em><br>\n<em> Governor, State of California</em><br>\n<em> State Capitol</em><br>\n<em> Sacramento, California 95814</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64728\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64728\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/","id":4656,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4655,4654,4653],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The Commission made it a goal to better address the concerns of the public in the upcoming meeting, which will include a presentation by staff from the Santa Barbara County Planning and Development and Santa Barbara County Public Works to discuss proposed parking strategies mentioned in the Isla Vista Master Plan.</p>\n<p>Fifth District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Daniel Blough said he was doubtful of the survey results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know when they did the survey, but the information was not accurate,” Blough said.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year mathematics major Brent Roth, the parking situation in I.V. is not conducive to students or residents, and parking spots are too small and not secure.</p>\n<p>“The parking situation in Isla Vista is just terrible, I can’t stress that enough,” Roth said. “The biggest issue is space and ensuring that your car is safe.”<br>\nFourth-year environmental studies major Lino Martinez said he has not seen a recent increase in parking.</p>\n<p>“The increase in 15 percent doesn’t seem like it represents actually what is occurring,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>According to Second District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Cecilia Brown, the duty of the Planning Commission is to obtain accurate information regarding the current state of parking in I.V. with help from Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the meeting is to get current pertinent information about the parking situation and to get greater community input,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>Brown said she is glad there will be a meeting where the public can participate.</p>\n<p>“They need to participate, they need to come and tell the county what their experience is,” Brown said. “Their input is valuable.”</p>\n<p>County of SB Planning and Development Associate Planner Katie Hentrich said community input from the meeting this Monday will be discussed at the next Committee meeting.</p>\n<p>“The County is seeking feedback on the proposed parking strategies to survey parking availability,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said both the Planning and Development and the Public Work staff will present various solutions to the parking situation in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The proposed parking strategies include an on-street parking monitoring and reporting system to assess on-street parking capacity and vacancy rates in the community,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>If available parking is found to be below an increase of 15 percent then more surveys will be taken to find new strategies such as a permit system, according to Hentrich.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, if data results indicate vacancy rates remain low, a permit parking program would be implemented,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said she encourages community members to attend the meeting.</p>\n<p>“This meeting is a good opportunity for permanent residents and students to participate in the planning process,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

community of Isla Vista is certainly one of the biggest perks of attending UC Santa Barbara. Despite the iconic party scene and the picturesque setting, there are risks that are inevitable in a college town. Daily Nexus sat down with three students from the Associated Students Public Safety Commission to give you the tips you need to have a safe time out on the streets of I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Dwayne Mosbey</strong><br>\n<strong> A.S. Senator and Liaison to the Public Safety Commission Ashcon Minoiefar</strong><br>\n<strong> Former A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Molly Morrison</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students be cautious of when going into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> When on the streets or in a party, a simple look around at what is happening can keep you safe, your friends safe and out of trouble with law enforcement. Isla Vista is a friendly and fun place, so it should be enjoyed. But being conscious of what you or your friends are doing will keep you safe, out of jail or getting the infamous MIP (Minor in Possession) … Although it’s an amazing place, Isla Vista unfortunately falls victim to crimes like theft, assault and sexual assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Even though we are in a relatively safe community, be aware of areas with poor lighting and do not engage those who are behaving in an antagonistic manner towards you. When going out be sure to keep track of your drink and never allow anyone to make or give one to you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students do to prepare for potentially dangerous situations?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The easiest way to get yourself into trouble is by not knowing what you or your friends plan on doing. If you’re going to drink and walk DP, which every freshman will understandably do, have a game plan if things don’t work out. Eat some food before, have an idea of where you want to go, have a backup plan if that doesn’t work out (Freebirds nachos are a solid move), and make sure you know where your friends are when you want to head back home. Pouring too many shots back and aimlessly wandering Isla Vista after not getting into any parties is a surefire way to get yourself into some trouble.<br>\nMosbey: When you go out, be sure to have friends accompany you and keep track of each other throughout the night! Familiarize yourself with the local area and as well be aware of the safest routes to take. Be sure to take care of your personal belongings and keep track of them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are some resources that students can access when they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The number-one resource students should be aware of is the CSO Escort program. The number is (805) 893-8000 … Call 911 if you or anyone around you is in any danger, perceived or real. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol can respond to a call very, very quickly and should always be reached out to … Good Samaritan Laws in California provide both the caller and the one in medical need amnesty from prosecution for minor crimes like minor in consumption or drug use. Their priority is getting the person in need of medical attention to the hospital, not citing you a MIP. So don’t hesitate to call.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services is the most valuable resource this campus has for students seeking mental help of any kind, ranging from the most benign forms of stress to other more serious disorders. There should be no stigma associated with wanting to seek help — Counseling and Psychological Services just fought a huge battle against UC budgets to stay a strong force on this campus, and students should really be utilizing this wonderful service more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> Who can students reach out to if they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> Make sure to go to your friends as a support group, no one will be there for you like the friends you meet here at UCSB. Professors can be great help when your course load is getting crazy. Stop by their office hours and you will be amazed how helpful they can be. The SRB [Student Resource Building] has a mind-boggling amount of services. The Womyn’s Center is an amazing resource for many things, including any services pertaining to sexual assault. If you are injured out in Isla Vista or wherever and are having trouble getting to class, check out the Disabled Students Program in the SRB for help.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> When students start to feel that they need help, the most important thing to do is NOT TO STAY QUIET! There are so many people who want to help, and all you have to do is ask. Don’t know where to go? Start with your RA. Don’t have an RA? Walk right into Student Health or Counseling and Psychological Services. No one is judgmental; everyone wants you to do well and BE well.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What do you recommend students bring with them when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Always be sure to have some form of ID when you go out, preferably a state-issued or government ID, as well as a fully charged phone, emergency contact information and your keys (for those who are prone to losing them, buy a carbineer or lanyard.)</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Buddy system. Too often have students wandered off by themselves, and most end up fine, but some have gotten into situations they did not intend, which can have really serious repercussions … When you go out, always carry a form of ID on you … Also bring an open, but grounded mind and heart. Being under any influence may make you more prone to decisions you wouldn’t make otherwise, so make sure to always have your best interests take priority over everything else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are common mistakes made by students, especially freshman or transfers, when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The most common mistake made in Isla Vista is not spacing out your shots or handle pulls. It’s really easy to fill time between conversations with shots. But what we don’t realize until we make this mistake a few times, is that five shots in one hour is a lot. You won’t feel any shots you take for 30 minutes after you take it at the very least, and it’s usually more like an hour. So if you’re not spacing your shots out, you’re gonna have a bad time when it all hits you. Best way to avoid this is to know that saying no to a shot really isn’t that big of a deal … [people] will forget about it in less than a second.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Young adults at this age haven’t fully developed critical decision-making parts of their brain yet, so it’s difficult to figure out if you’re really making the right decision if you are thrust into a neighborhood where there are little to zero authority or parental figures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 &amp; 7 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/","id":4658,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4657,4656,4655],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
