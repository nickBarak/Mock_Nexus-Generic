The match ended UCSB’s regular season schedule as it looks towards next weekend’s MPSF quarterfinal matchup against No. 3 Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>​Santa Barbara ended the regular season with a 17-9 record, going 13-9 in MPSF matches. The win left the team in the No. 6 spot going into the MPSF playoffs. The loss put Stanford’s record at 10-18, 7-15 in MPSF play, meaning the Cardinals will miss the playoffs by one spot in the standings one year after losing in the NCAA final.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The team was passing really well last night. The passers made my job extremely easy,” junior setter Jonah Seif said. “It made it difficult for the opposing blockers to set up and our hitters did a great job. We played a really strong match overall last night.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was dominant throughout, with a .447 hitting percentage in the match. Senior redshirt outside hitter Kevin Donohue led the team with 15 kills in the match as he did not commit an error and posted a .536 hitting percentage. Sophomore outside hitter Jacob Delson had a fantastic hitting night as well, with 10 kills on 13 swings for a .736 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Filling in for senior outside hitter Weston Nielson, who did not dress because of the flu, junior outside hitter Spencer Buckley added seven kills. “Buck’s” versatility has been huge for the Gauchos down the stretch, as he has consistently come off the bench and done a great job in a starting role.</p>\n<p>Seif recorded his fourth straight double-double with 32 assists and 10 digs, as well as four block assists. All around, it was a great performance from the Gauchos from start to finish.</p>\n<p>​“Everyone was in synch with Jonah,” Donohue said. “We caught a rhythm at the beginning of the match and it continued throughout all three sets.”</p>\n<p>​Stanford didn’t have much of a chance against Santa Barbara, as the Gauchos put up an intimidating block at the net all night. Senior middle blocker Jake Staahl led the team with eight block assists and junior middle blocker Ryan Hardy added five. Overall, UCSB had 14 blocks to Stanford’s four, and the Cardinals were only able to muster a .088 hitting percentage in the match.</p>\n<p>​UCSB finished the season sixth in MPSF standings after No. 6 BYU defeated No. 1 Hawaii in two matches this weekend. The Gauchos will travel to Malibu this Saturday to take on Pepperdine, a team they defeated in four sets this past week.</p>\n<p>​“We’re gonna push ourselves this week,” Donohue said. “It’s gonna be a solid week and we’re confident that we can go into their gym and replicate the way we played last week and that we’ll come out with the win.”</p>\n<p>​After having been ranked No. 3 in the nation at the beginning of the season, UCSB lost a few matches early in the season that the team believes it should have won. Since those losses, the Gauchos have been fighting back to get the highest playoff spot they could earn. Santa Barbara has a lot of confidence going into its rematch with Pepperdine, even though the team knows the Waves will be hungry to defend their own court after losing on their senior night.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been in a playoff mentality the last few weeks,” Seif said. “We did what we needed to do this week with our two wins. The climb continues for us; we have guys who have been to the playoffs before and we’re confident going into this week.”</p>\n<p>After a week of practice, UCSB takes on Pepperdine on Saturday in Malibu at 7:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62590\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/no-9-ucsb-knocks-no-14-stanford-out-of-postseason-contention/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62590\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/no-9-ucsb-knocks-no-14-stanford-out-of-postseason-contention/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/no-9-ucsb-knocks-no-14-stanford-out-of-postseason-contention/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/no-9-ucsb-knocks-no-14-stanford-out-of-postseason-contention/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/no-9-ucsb-knocks-no-14-stanford-out-of-postseason-contention/","id":5101,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5100,5099,5098],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss","biography":"Not available","articles":[172,174,176,177,187,188,193,195,197,198,212,213,214,216,233,235,412,525,725,748,779,801,804,2029,2038,3286,4901,5013,5026,5042,5063,5064,5068,5069,5101,5102,5103,5106,5124,5125,5126,5137,5141,5142,5143,5144,5145,5146,5147,5148,5149,5150,5183,5185,5186,5187,5190,5191,5310,5315,5318,5319,5320,5321,5322,5323,5338,5339,5341,5346],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Remain Motivated Heading into Conference Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C480&ssl=1","description":"After a difficult conference opening match against No. 10 Hawai'i, UCSB women's volleyball knows the pressure is slowing rising and wins versus Cal State Northridge and No. 24 Long Beach State this we...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Adversity is an essential element of sports.

During non-conference play, the Gauchos averaged a .206 hitting clip. However, in their conference opener, they achieved a dismal .121 hitting percentage. Since losing 3-1 to SMU, the Gauchos have not had two players record double digit kills in the same contest.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing is we just have to keep getting better,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “If we keep getting better, we’re going to start to see the results we want in terms of the scoreboard.”</p>\n<p>Despite having just one win prior to the start of Big West play, Northridge has triumphantly kicked off its conference schedule. The Matadors, now 3-11, are on a two-game winning streak after sweeping UC Irvine and a 3-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Through just two conference games, CSUN sits atop the Big West in various statistical categories. Northridge currently leads the conference in kills (110), kills per set (15.71), assists (100), assists per set (14.29), and points (135.0).</p>\n<p>Bearing the offensive torch for the Matadors is senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson. She has been a key centerpiece to CSUN’s progression as she leads the team in kills (182) and blocks (24). Stinson has recorded double-digit kills in nine of Northridge’s games, and just this past Monday was named Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week. A well-deserved honor, as Stinson is coming off a weekend in which she tallied a total of 39 kills and averaged 5.57 kills per set to compliment a smashing .423 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Molding into Northridge’s next elite star at the outside hitter position is freshman Aeryn Owens. Despite a meager .127 hitting average so far this season, she ranks second in CSUN’s kills total with 111. Since the award’s creation prior to the 2014 season, Owens became the first Matador to receive the Big West Freshman of the Week award after chalking up 29 kills and a .313 hitting percentage in the team’s first two conference matches.</p>\n<p>The reigning champions of the Big West Conference, Cal State Long Beach has its eyes set on a repeat performance of its undefeated, 16-0 conference record of last season. Currently 12-3, the 49ers are off to an emphatic start at 2-0 after last weekend’s home conference opener.</p>\n<p>Cal State Long Beach’s determined foundation of players certainly helped pave the way for the 49ers’ success. Last season’s Big West Player of the Year, senior Jenelle Hudson became just the second setter in CSULB history to earn the award. She currently leads the Big West in assists with a total of 587 and sits second in assists per set with 10.30.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Ashley Murray was also recognized for her performance in last year’s remarkable run as she was the recipient of the 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year award. Aiding Murray at the middle blocker position is Ball State transfer, senior Hayley Benson. She recently earned Big West Defensive Player of the Week after tallying seven blocks and two blocks per set in the 49ers conference opener.</p>\n<p>Despite preparing for its second and third conference games of the season, the stakes are slowly heightening for UCSB as a win could reinvigorate the Gauchos’ hopes this season.</p>\n<p>“Right now our focus is first on CSUN and then we’ll look at Long Beach as well,” Lantagne Welch said. “It comes down to the process. Let’s put together what we did well this weekend and add a little bit more to it. We have the advantage of playing at home and the students are now back, and that could have a lot of stuff go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB versus Cal State Northridge will proceed at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, Following the Gauchos’ Friday bout is their Saturday match versus No. 24 Cal State Long Beach. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/","id":5098,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5097,5096,5095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 15 UCSB Hosts Veteran No. 9 Northridge Squad","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 15 UCSB will host second-place No. 9 Cal State Northridge in the team's final regular season match of the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team will have nothing more than a final tune-up game before the Big West tournament starts when it hosts No. 9 Cal State Northridge this Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still searching for their first win of the month after dropping three straight close games to Big West opponents.

[Northridge is] kind of a mystery to us right now, so we’re basically focusing on the fact that if we play our game the best that we can then everything’s going to be okay.”</p>\n<p>Defense is going to be the key for UCSB as it has to take on the conference’s top scorer in junior center Marisa Young. In just 29 games, Young has put up an astounding mark of 60 goals. No other player has hit even the 50-goal mark in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“We’re really focusing on fine-tuning what we need to work on,” Hudson said. “We’re focusing on getting our defense really quick and on-point and everyone on the same page. I think it’s going to be a battle of defense this weekend for sure.”</p>\n<p>As they look to end their recent three-game skid, the Gauchos will also have their hands full trying to contain attacker Lindsy Duncan. The senior has accumulated one of the highest goal scoring tallies in the conference with 47 while also leading her team in assists with 43.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played some really strong teams lately and I don’t think we’ve been performing poorly, necessarily. It’s just that we’ve been playing really strong competitors,” sophomore utility Holly Smith said. “We’ve played well, but we just need to take it to the next level in order to beat teams like Northridge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had won five straight games before losing its last three conference games, two of which were at home. However, with those losses coming by an average of less than three goals per game, the Gauchos know that they are on the right track heading towards the season’s finale.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better every single game,” Hudson said. “It’s not reflecting that in our record right now, but we’re also playing much higher ranked teams than in the beginning. If you look at the scores in the games we’ve lost, we’re actually playing teams a lot closer than in the beginning of the year.”</p>\n<p>One of the main issues for Santa Barbara from the beginning of the season was its inexperience due to a large number of freshmen and sophomores. Though talented, it has yet to be seen if that talent can outweigh the experience of some of the other teams in the conference heading into the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>“I think what’s missing right now is that little extra something to win a game when we’re tied or down by one with a minute left,” Hudson said. “Not many of us have that experience at this high level to really put a team away and finish a game strong. I think that’s definitely what we need to work on, and if we can do that then I think that the Big West tournament and the game against Northridge will go really well for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on the Matadors this Friday at 4 p.m. at Campus Pool for their final home match of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-15-ucsb-hosts-veteran-no-9-northridge-squad/","id":5099,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5098,5097,5096],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast CSUN in Regular Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPolo_CSUN-DustinHarris-04182014-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 15 UCSB secured the fifth seed in next week's conference tournament with a victory over Northridge this past weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final game of the regular season, the No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team took down No. 9 Cal State Northridge in a tightly contested match that went down to the wire.

Sophomore attacker Miranda Schrader held the ball up high on the right side and picked out her spot before firing one past the keeper to cut the deficit to one. Freshman attacker Brenna Thomas followed that up on the next possession with a deep shot from the left side to tie the game at 4-4.</p>\n<p>“When you get down by one or two goals you really have to shift gears and just fight from that point on,” Quinn said. “We did a really good job at going out there, controlling the game and staying up by one the entire time.”</p>\n<p>In the third quarter, junior utility Lauren Martin took advantage of Northridge on the inside with two strong goals in front of the net. Another goal from freshman attacker Carly Christian gave UCSB three for the quarter, but CSUN had an answer every time.</p>\n<p>“We made a couple of small adjustments, but that was just sort of how the game was going,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “There wasn’t necessarily one turning point in the game; we clawed back, got a couple goals, played solid defense and held on from there.”</p>\n<p>The biggest adjustment for the Gauchos came in the form of Quinn, who subbed in for the second half. The freshman had played in one game all year before this one, but she made her presence felt in the final period.</p>\n<p>Northridge senior attacker Lindsy Duncan scored on a deep lob shot to tie it once again at 7-7 with fewer than six minutes to go, subsequently setting up a thrilling finish.</p>\n<p>With 4:30 left in the game, the Gauchos took advantage of a 6-on-5 situation with Porter just getting a shot to go despite the keeper getting a hand to it, giving them the lead once again.</p>\n<p>From this point on, every desperate attempt to tie the game was smothered by the UCSB defense and Quinn, who had three big saves late, including an outstanding point-blank stop with just 50 seconds remaining. Northridge was unable to find a shot in the final minute as the Gauchos held on for the win.</p>\n<p>No. 5 seed UCSB will play No. 4 seed Long Beach State this Friday at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-outlast-csun-in-regular-season-finale/","id":5100,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5099,5098,5097],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
