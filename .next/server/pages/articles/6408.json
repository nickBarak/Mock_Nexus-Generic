I am an avid fan of toys and if you aren’t, then you’ve probably never had one.</p>\n<p>Though initially timid about self-lovin’, my ex bought me my first, and since then its rumbling voice has coaxed out many a satisfied sigh. If you’re intrigued by toys but have never summoned the cajones, or if you are a veteran vagina-whisperer, then please, read on.</p>\n<p>The best way to take the next step is to integrate a lovely assistant into this party in your pants. Don’t be shy; a lot of the time guys are just randomly pushing your buttons in hopes of setting off some fireworks. With this, he knows that you are for sure going to get yours (your junk will be properly rewarded for all his misaligned prodding). Allow me to suggest some options that I have found to be incredibly gratifying.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you’re just starting out with toys and are unsure how to best implement the aforementioned “vroom vroom” to your nighttime boom boom, I recommend cock-rings.</p>\n<p>It turns your gentleman’s giblets into a trembling, quivering shaft, which is still not the full-blown experience of a vibrator, but imbues you with a sense of the good things to come in your sex toy future (let it happen).</p>\n<p>You can get these bad boys for five bucks a pop, so no high financial commitment is required. Cock rings are very simple and require little effort on the part of the sir. Just stretch the ring around his deep-V diver and have it settle around the base. And voila! Now, have sex.</p>\n<p>Before I move on, a word of advice: Do not invest in the ones that go inside of you. It is certainly uncomfortable to have a small device inside of you already when your Casanova is insistent on stabbing it further in with his wang. Just mellow out with the basic version. You’ll get comfortable with the idea of vibrators, he’ll enjoy mixing it up, but it’s all still familiar.</p>\n<p>Once invested in a vibrator of a higher caliber, line up in naughty spoons and have him enter you from behind. Bring your top leg up so that your fleshy flower is exposed and he can have full access to it. The angle is tight for you both and there’s going to be clitoral stimulation up the yin-yang. He can then hold the vibrator to it as he goes for the gold from behind. The dual action feels crazy good and you can both get off. I suppose this position would work for both of you lying on top of him or doggy-style, but I feel you both can balance better and focus on the task at hand with a greater deal of precision.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve been foraying into the world of kink and my hook-up buddy played this little gem out for me (more on that delicious topic later!) Standing up with your arms behind your back (good luck with that), he has the vibrator. What I like about this one is that it can work for either g-spot vibrators or ones that stimulate your clit. He holds it to your bits, rubbing it back and forth, in and out, what have you. The catch? You cannot reach your happy ending until he says so. You must ask him. If he’s naughty, he’ll take a few moments to ponder your request. Once given the okay, the desperation will give way to wicked awesomeness. You should do this close to a cushioned surface, as you will most likely fall over and eat shit otherwise, Jello-legs.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you are a guy and interested in how a vibrator would feel, that’s great. Why wouldn’t you want your junk to be electronically stimulated? We dig it, so why wouldn’t you? While I am fearful of referring to Cosmo’s suggestions, one in particular did seem safe and potentially enjoyable. Very simply, when she is going down on you, stick the vibrator to her cheek. The muted vibrations alongside her already righteous tongue lavishing should be pretty bomb.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, I leave you to fantasize about toys. Go forth, prosper and bask in all they have to offer. You should always be comfortable with your body. Doesn’t it seem a little silly to be unfamiliar with what’s between your legs?</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. has managed to make jello that much dirtier.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48191\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48191\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/","id":6408,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6407,6406,6405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E.","biography":"Not available","articles":[6320,6325,6328,6347,6349,6351,6353,6356,6359,6361,6363,6368,6371,6372,6374,6376,6377,6381,6408],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Lessons From The Bachelor and the Older, Sexless Buddy","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted to keep his relationship with a girl casual.

Let’s call him a “noncommittal dating partner.” Understandably, however, he was often mistaken for a boyfriend by innocent bystanders.</p>\n<p>“Fine,” the girl thought. “He wants to keep it casual? I’ll show him casual.” So the girl didn’t call him during the week, and he used the freedom to attend college night at the local bowling alley. Now that I’ve mentioned college night, let’s back up for a minute. Now would be a good time to mention the fact that the man in question is 31 years old. While Wednesday night at Zodo’s is all well and good for 21-year-olds, there’s an unspoken age limit.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there he was at the bowling alley. Meanwhile, his non-girlfriend was at home partaking in her standard Wednesday evening activity: drinking herbal tea and pondering her coolness. “God, it is so awesome of me to let my noncommittal dating partner do his thing ALL THE TIME and never even question him about it. He’s so lucky to have me,” she thought, blissfully unaware that he was not in fact standing in the bowling alley, thinking about how laid-back she was. Rather, he was getting age-inappropriately drunk, trying to forget about his now-dysfunctional man parts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let’s rewind to a couple months before this particular night at Zodo’s. The girl and her noncommittal dating partner had been seeing each other for a few weeks at that point, and while they were having fun, there seemed to be an unspoken agreement that the relationship was not going to become serious. Though the girl didn’t tell the 31-year-old man at the time, there were a few reasons she was okay with the arrangement: A) He doesn’t read. Repeat after me: He does not read. In fact, the only thing he reads is <em>Maxim</em> magazine … when he’s enjoying some bathroom time; and then, of course, there’s B) He never complained when she made him watch <em>The Bachelor</em>, and actually seemed to enjoy the show. Unless you’re gay or my dad, that’s an unacceptable male hobby.</p>\n<p>Oh, wait, there’s one other thing that would validate being a grown ass man and voluntarily watching a ridiculous reality show aimed at 18-year-old girls: you’re doing it to get laid. There are probably millions of blue-blooded American men who spend their Monday evenings watching dudes with weird hair present desperate women with roses, all in the hopes that they’ll receive over-the-pants handy J’s during commercial breaks and then go full throttle once the rose ceremony is over. In this particular case, the girl hoped that was the reason for her noncommittal dating partner’s acceptance — and occasional downright enthusiasm — over watching <em>The Bachelor</em>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps naively, she thought she could have the best of both worlds: someone who was</p>\n<p>willing to watch a mindless reality show and engage in quickies whenever the dialogue got boring. With that in mind, she climbed on top of the man during a commercial break one Monday night. At first, he responded by gently making out with her and even moving to second base. But as soon as the bachelor’s voice boomed in the background, he couldn’t shove her away fast enough. Laughing, the girl (who thought that if she couldn’t get a commitment out of this man, she could at least get some decent sex) closed the laptop and reached for the zipper on his pants. Not laughing, he opened the laptop and informed the half-naked girl prepping for a blowjob that he “wants to see who will get the rose.”</p>\n<p>… What?</p>\n<p>She should have forced herself to break it off (literally, figuratively, metaphorically or all of the above) right then. But she mistook his sexual disinterest for reality show super-fandom and let it go. She would find out later that he was avoiding his not-so-fuck-buddy’s attempt at a BJ because he knew something she didn’t: he doesn’t like blowjobs. Or sex. [Editor’s note: The upcoming sentence was difficult to write and is likely to make everyone involved cringe and mutter condolences to the poor guy.] He didn’t want anything to touch his penis because he cannot keep it up.</p>\n<p>The next week, the same situation repeated itself. Girls pranced around on the TV screen, and the girl, still oblivious to any sort of long-term problem, got bored with the show and reached for his man area. He recoiled and muttered something about “issues” and “taking longer than other guys,” as he zipped up his pants and headed for the bathroom, probably to read Maxim and attempt to jack off. The naive, sexually-frustrated heroine of this saga sighed as she lay back on her pillows, thinking longingly of the men in her past who were blessed with functional plumbing.</p>\n<p>Later, when the nearly illiterate 31-year-old arrived at her house to have the break-up talk, the girl nodded, smiled and bit her tongue on more than one occasion. “This is really hard,” he said, fighting back tears. <em>No, it’s really not</em>, she thought, trying not to let her eyes travel to his man part region. “I’m just glad we’re getting out of this before I’m in too deep,” he continued. <em>No danger of that</em>, she thought with a sigh.</p>\n<p>So concludes the tale of the sexless fuck buddy. The girl, who doesn’t understand penises and probably never will, could tell countless other similar stories, but they all have the same moral: you can’t have sex with something that doesn’t want to, and you can’t not have sex with someone who doesn’t want a relationship.

This is the only correct answer; I never have an alternative. I am conditioned to this detachment from my own emotions and find it even harder to express vulnerability in the face of a supposed professional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My appointment consists of fluff: surface-level talk about my family, studies and extracurricular activities dominates the conversation. When it concludes, my therapist inquires if I have any interest in group therapy. He explains that I would forfeit the opportunity of having one-on-one appointments with a therapist, but the support that group therapy will provide is so monumental it should outweigh any doubts I have about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/division/div49\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Psychological Association</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, group therapy “involves one or more psychologists who lead a group of roughly five up to fifteen patients.” It usually addresses some sort of problem such as shyness, loneliness, anxiety and social anxiety (although I find it slightly ironic having to discuss your social anxiety in front of a large group of people). </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/group-therapy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Ben Johnson</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a member of the American Psychological Association, claims that there are a multitude of benefits worth reaping from group therapy, such as support, guidance of a professional and empathy from those who share similar experiences. At first glance, it seems like group therapy might work. In theory, it has potential: You can listen to people who undergo similar issues and find ways to apply other perspectives to your problems, gain a sense of inclusivity and grow more self-aware. If you’ve been in a difficult mental place before, you might find it helpful to attend and possibly learn better coping mechanisms from a professional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is impractical to say that the advantages of group therapy apply to everyone, especially since it demands complete openness to strangers who may breach confidentiality. Participants must express sheer transparency about their personal lives to more than five people they may not know, much less trust. The American Mental Health Foundation states that it proves even more difficult in situations in which members are in crises or are suicidal, as “it is necessary to function with a degree of normalcy.”  Yet, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, there are</span><a href=\"https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/depression\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 16 million people </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the world diagnosed with depression, a common precursor to having suicidal thoughts, and a myriad of them attend group therapy.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression is truly a leech. It sucks the motivation, happiness and joy out of your life — but do not lose all hope. Navigating my way through mental health disorders was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, and I am still doing it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, individual therapy is also an option. The American Psychological Association claims that individual therapy is successful due to high confidentiality, therapeutic alliance and an individualized approach to treatment. Confidentiality is not easily breached in such a private environment, which could prove useful to elevate a patient’s sense of safety. An elevated sense of safety could consequently promote a therapeutic alliance, allowing more bonding between both therapist and client to encourage the client to share more aspects of his or her life. Such therapeutic alliance can also assist a therapist in formulating plans to cater toward an individual’s needs and pace. However, the success rate of individualized therapy is highly contingent on a client’s willingness to open up and the therapist’s willingness to listen and provide constructive insight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I personally attended both group and individual therapy sessions, I found none of my therapists to be a good fit. For a while, I thought maybe I was just too difficult to understand or that my situation was too complicated for an outsider to make a coherent judgement. So I began doing other things that helped me cope: I returned to my beginnings and slowly picked up my old hobbies again. Before my downward spiral began, music and writing were both huge components of my life. Motivating myself to be productive with the things I loved was difficult, but in the long run, it was an effective step in the right direction. In fact, the American Psychological Association </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compiled a number of studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which suggested a positive correlation between music and promoted recovery of depression or stress. With this in mind, alternative options to talk therapy should be considered for those who do not find words the most accessible form of expression. Art, music and even online therapies are all possibilities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression is truly a leech. It sucks the motivation, happiness and joy out of your life — but do not lose all hope. Navigating my way through mental health disorders was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, and I am still doing it. But there are people out there who want to help you, and although I found utilizing therapists ineffective, this does not mean you will. It does get better, and you will eventually find peace once you try healing methods tailored to you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time C.A.P.S. suggests group therapy or asks if you’d like to continue your current sessions, think twice about what works for you. Options at a university are limited, but there are a multitude of outside resources in the real world that could potentially benefit you. It is difficult to know what works without trying a vast range of therapies, but once you find the right method, I hope you can say “I’m good” and mean it. The road to recovery is a long one, but there are no speed limits. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Feng thinks that everyone has an individualized approach to therapy and there should be no rush to figure things out. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/group-or-individual-therapy-it-depends-on-you/","id":6406,"author":{"id":795,"name":"Jasmine Feng"},"related":[6405,6404,6403],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Getting A’s and Taking L’s","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=650%2C464&ssl=1","description":"Joshen Mantai examines how academic pressure has negatively impacted her mental health in college.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know when I first realized I had academic anxiety. I remember in middle school breezing through Algebra I and geometry while most others had trouble. After every test was handed back in math, the first reaction from my friend would be, “What’d you make? I bet you got a 100.” The teacher would hand me the test back, my face would turn beat red and my heart would feel like it was about to explode out of my chest.

Coping with academic anxiety is a struggle that I’ve dealt with my whole life. It’s something I didn’t see the direct effects of when I was younger, but it gradually built up over time. At a young age, I was placed into the category of “academic talent.” My defining personality trait was decided for me before I could figure it out for myself: she’s the “smart one.” I remember being placed into the gifted student program in elementary school and being confused at what exactly it meant to be academically gifted. It didn’t help that my parents are engineers and that I’m half Indian — two facets which people attributed to my academic success as genetic.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87691\" style=\"width: 554px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87691\" data-attachment-id=\"87691\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-24/getting-as-and-taking-ls/academic-anxiety/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=650%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,464\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Academic anxiety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87691\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Academic-anxiety-e1556158676471.png?resize=544%2C388\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"388\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic anxiety is not something I’ve ever talked about with anyone or an aspect that anyone in my life has really noticed.

Whenever I would express nervousness or get back a grade that was not up to my standards my friends would laughingly tell me, “Oh shut up, you ace everything.” This aspect of “acing everything” wasn’t something that was an accomplishment for me anymore; it was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expected</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from my friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve tried to figure out what this anxiety boiling inside me stems from for a long time because my parents never pushed me toward perfection. They just wanted me to do my best. I’ve realized my anxiety originates from the notion that I want to emulate the success of people in my life, namely my parents, but also live up to this “smart” personality trait that has defined me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recognized that I can’t live up to this defining trait. We live in an increasingly bright generation of students who have pushed the boundaries of success toward something unattainable for most of us. It’s no longer ok to be “average.” Colleges, employers, our parents: They are all looking for some nuance of greatness in each one of us, which I was led to believe would be my exemplary academic success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, my extended family told me they had no doubt my grades alone would get me into any college I desired, something they didn’t realize many students had going for them. I live in a pool of intelligent students, a pond of intelligence which has grown quickly over time in which I discovered I am a very small fish. And I’m ok with that. It’s not the aspect of competition that is the root of my anxiety, but rather my attainment of individual success. I cried once in high school when I got a B on a test because I was so disappointed in myself. Yes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an actual B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I realized how stupid it was later that I cried over a B, but the anxiety associated with earning a B didn’t go away, just the initial extreme reaction.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/02/03/stress-and-isolation-blamed-for-string-of-suicides-at-columbia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suicide rates at colleges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — especially Ivy League campuses from increasing academic pressure and schoolwork-related stress — indicates the pervasiveness of academic anxiety. These kids are portrayed as students who never left their dorm room or couldn’t cope with the pressure of going to such a competitive school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I feel academically challenged at UCSB, but the pressure of going to an Ivy League would be insurmountable for me. Being surrounded by geniuses and trying to define success for myself in that environment would cause me to reach a mental breaking point. I’ve heard stories about some Ivy League schools where if a student leaves their notes on a desk unattended, other students will trash them in an attempt to eliminate some competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s not just Ivy League schools. I’ve seen my friends’ Snapchat stories where they’re stressed and staying up until 3 a.m. to finish that 30-page paper and got maybe four hours of sleep before their next class. And that’s when I realized that college isn’t just a struggle for me but an cumbersome fight for all of us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stress associated with obtaining good grades in a college quarter system is exponential. A 10-week course with a few major assignments making up the bulk of your grade is not exactly a framework that is conducive for students to succeed. We’re encouraged to take 15-17 units a quarter, which is a lot to juggle with sports, jobs, clubs and maintaining a social life. I didn’t realize the extremity of this until the end of Winter Quarter.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pride in getting A’s was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winter Quarter was a wake-up call for me. It was rainy, I was taking 17 units and it was the perfect condition for me to slack off. I have never felt as much anxiety as I did when I was sick during finals week. I felt as though I couldn’t breathe every time I finished one of my four finals — not just because my nasal passages were blocked, but also because I did the bare minimum to get by that quarter up until then. The intensity of cramming information into my brain was too much. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while I did get A’s in my classes Winter Quarter, I didn’t feel satisfied. Why? Because the expectation of succeeding was no longer external, it was something ingrained in me. The pride in getting As was small compared to the disappointment I would feel if I didn’t. I convinced myself if I didn’t get an A in one of my classes, I would be a colossal failure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Winter Quarter ended up being a wake-up call for my mental health. I know it isn’t reasonable to place these burdensome expectations on myself, but I still don’t know how to alleviate my academic anxiety; I don’t think any of us do. But I do know one thing: Academic success does not define us as students. We all have learning curves. While one of us may have an aptitude for calculus, someone else may have a knack for literature. We as a generation have a naive but admirable tendency to want to achieve greatness and make something of ourselves no matter the cost. After all, that’s what our parents did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But however you define success, you should never put it before your mental health. The anxiety caused by the desire to succeed is probably not going to be absent in our kids and future generations, but we should convince them that it’s more important to prioritize mental health than the anxiety of the burdens we’re facing. It’s not something we can just convince ourselves of, but something we have to instill in each other. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants you to prioritize your mental health and talk about your anxiety with someone else.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.
