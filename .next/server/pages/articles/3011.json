The candidates for each position have also been revealed, and OPP’s Ali Guthy will run against DP’s Navi Kaur for A.S. President. Voting will begin next Monday and will take place through GOLD.</p>\n<p>Other OPP and DP candidates running include Beatrice Contreras and Daniela Bayon for External Vice President of Local Affairs and Melvin Singh and Kashira Ayers for External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, respectively. OPP’s Angela Lau will run uncontested for Internal Vice President. Independents Bhrigu Ghandi, Amir Khazaieli and Bailey Loverin will run for Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>Singh, third-year political science and film &amp; media studies double major running for EVPSA, said although elections officially began yesterday the process really started near the end of last quarter.</p>\n<p>“Week seven or eight [of Winter Quarter] was the official declaration of candidacy. That’s when everyone was aware,” Singh said. “It wasn’t completely public yet, but that’s when the whole filing process was, and a week later, that’s when they officially announced the eligible candidates for A.S.”</p>\n<p>Steven Kwok, a first-year economics and accounting major running as an on-campus senator with DP, said the locations of signs depend on the positions that the candidates run for. Those running for executive positions place their signs near Storke Tower, on-campus senators place their signs on paths leading to residence halls and off-campus senators place their signs near Pardall Tunnel.</p>\n<p>“Every senator that has a board has put it somewhere on campus,” Kwok said. “That’s how we’re doing it now. It’s basically a free-for-all, so if you get that spot, you claim that spot.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and chair of the A.S. Elections Committee Claire Fox said her organization is in charge of ensuring that the entire elections process is run in a fair and efficient manner. According to Fox, the elections code includes rules ranging from GPA requirements for candidates to the maximum number of organizations allowed on campus, and students are often the ones who report violations.</p>\n<p>“Students tend to make complaints if they feel there has been a violation with the elections code, and we make a determination and contact the candidate who has been charged or just assess the situation,” Fox said.</p>\n<p>Fiona Hayman, a first-year political science major and voting member on the A.S. Elections Committee, said these next two weeks could be hectic due to the intensity of the campaigning and number of complaints submitted.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received some complaints, but pretty much this week is when campaigning starts, so the complaints will start to roll in, and we’ll be dealing a lot with that,” Hayman said. “The craziness starts now.”</p>\n<p>Fox said the forums being held this week in The Hub will be a good way for students to learn about each candidates’ platforms.</p>\n<p>“If [students are] really concerned about lighting in I.V., they can ask the candidates what their plan is for that,” Fox said. “It’s good to be an informed voter, and the forums really help with that.”</p>\n<p>According to Hayman, next Thursday will be an exciting night full of emotion, as each candidates’ campaigning efforts will come down to either a win or a loss.</p>\n<p>“After [the elections], there’s results night, which is celebratory for some, very sad for some, so that’s an exciting time. And then, it’ll calm down for us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54834\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54834\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/","id":3011,"author":{"id":184,"name":"Aditya Tadanki"},"related":[3010,3009,3008],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":184,"name":"Aditya Tadanki","biography":"Not available","articles":[3002,3008,3011,3067],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Forum Addresses Master Plan Reform in Light of Funding Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Leading up to the University of California Regents Meeting on May 14 and 15, the UCSB E.V.P.S.A Office, A.S.

Office of the President and A.S. Academic Affairs Board hosted a forum on the California Master Plan of Higher Education in the Student Resource Building yesterday.</p>\n<p>After UCSB became the first school to pass a resolution in support of reevaluating the Master Plan in 2013, UC President Janet Napolitano said at January’s UC Regent’s meeting that she was open to revising the plan to better serve students’ needs. Former A.S. President Harrison Weber, Literature and American Studies Professor Chris Newfield and Economics Professor Jon Sonstelie spoke at yesterday’s forum, offering different academic and professional perspectives on reevaluating the plan.</p>\n<p>According to Newfield, reforming the Master Plan is necessary because smaller UC campuses fund larger universities in the system and therefore have an actual investment in these other schools.</p>\n<p>“We could talk about breaking up the UC system for the simple reason that UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego and the other smaller UC campuses subsidize UC Berkeley and UCLA,” Newfield said.</p>\n<p>Newfield said the UC system is currently struggling financially because California residents have not understood the importance of public investment.</p>\n<p>“We had 30 years of cheapness,” Newfield said. “Thirty years of older people not being willing to pay for younger people — 30 years of people not understanding what public investment is.”</p>\n<p>Sonstelie disagreed with Newfield’s desire to have the general public foot the cost of the University of California system, as he said college education needs to be funded partially through grants and loans. College graduates earn 50 percent more in wages over their lifetime than high school graduates do, according to Sonstelie, making fees an inevitable but not necessarily impossible obstacle.</p>\n<p>“I totally understand the problem that borrowing money now is a problem, but I think it’s the only way it works,” Sonstelie said. “It doesn’t make sense for someone to pay for another person to make 50 percent more money than them … I hate to say it, but we have to figure out how to finance education through some sort of grants and some sort of loans.”</p>\n<p>According to Sonstelie, debt can be managed in better ways than it currently is, possibly through the support of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>“I just think we need to make debt work better,” Sonstelie said. “What it comes down to is asking middle-class families in California to subsidize the education for people that will be wealthy in the future.”</p>\n<p>Former A.S. President Weber said the way students approach higher education today is fundamentally flawed. Many students are underprepared for the demands of a research university and should first attend junior colleges before determining whether they are suited for four-year research universities, according to Weber.</p>\n<p>“In my estimation, there should be far more students getting their first two years of education at a community college and then decide whether they want to go to a research university,” Weber said.</p>\n<p>Sonstelie disagreed with Weber and argued for increased competition at UC Santa Barbara. According to Sonstelie, UC Santa Barbara deserves more credit than it currently receives.</p>\n<p>“I’m in favor of more competition,” Sonstelie said. “The way the system is set up, there’s a monopoly on prestige. I’d like to see us compete up there more.”</p>\n<p>However, Newfield said the most important issue to address is funding, as once funding issues are rectified then the UC system will not have the same problems rationing resources for students.</p>\n<p>“We’re sending you out there to compete with Stanford students, and you get one class in four years with 15 students,” Newfield said. “We fix the funding issue first. With the sufficient funds, I don’t think there’s going to be the same amount of rationing needs.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/","id":3008,"author":{"id":184,"name":"Aditya Tadanki"},"related":[3007,3006,3005],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It passed with nearly unanimous support, as only Senator Montana MacLachlan chose to abstain from the vote.</p>\n<p>Regarding the resolution, student sponsor of the legislation Guy Singer said the bill provided adequate leeway for the university to implement its demands without undue burden.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to give the UC Regents … and the treasury a lot of space with this,” Singer said. “Because it’s a big transition, we are giving them five years.”</p>\n<p>According to Singer, the goal is to get similar legislation passed at all UC campuses during the summer.</p>\n<p>Later, discussion on the bill to update A.S. election code began when Senator Ansel Lundberg read a letter aloud in support of the bill, which demands that a new single transferable vote (STV) system be implemented before the next A.S. election. The system would use preferential voting in which students would rank candidates according to favorability and would roll over votes of candidates that received less first-choice votes.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the current election system led to an unfair domination by a single party that does not accurately represent students.</p>\n<p>“The fact that a single party has come to dominate the representation of the entire student body represents a failure on the part of UCSB’s Associated Students,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the large numbers of voters that did not support the Open People’s Party were essentially disenfranchised by the current system. Lundberg said this exclusion is even more prominent after “two straight years of thousands of votes cast for DP candidates [led] to zero seats in the Senate.”</p>\n<p>MacLachlan said the STV system has a set of its own concerns, particularly in how it encourages for a competition in popularity between candidates and marginalizes political party influence.</p>\n<p>“I know that one issue that has been talked about is that if people ran more individually then it would turn into a popularity contest,” MacLachlan said. “What’s the counterargument to that?”</p>\n<p>In response, Lundberg said the new electoral system would not compromise the ability of parties to impact elections.</p>\n<p>“I would say that it still allows parties to thrive and in no way undermines parties … We’re not trying to ban parties,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Senator Derek Wakefield said the outgoing Senate is currently in an ideal position to pass legislation affecting the electoral system, as they are less likely to be hindered by political affiliations.</p>\n<p>“We are going to be leaving next week, so that puts us in a really good position to change toward a system such as this because essentially elections and winning is not as much in our minds,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Wakefield also said the bill to change the A.S. elections process represents a significant, influential and final piece of legislation for this year’s Senate.</p>\n<p>“As our last act of Senate, we can change how we are represented,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Following discussion on the bill to update the A.S. elections code, a bill to update student lobby legal code was tabled after various senators expressed opposition to it.</p>\n<p>Senator John Soriano said he felt concerned that the bill violated the lobby’s autonomy.</p>\n<p>“It’s not fair for the board to be told what to do before they’ve even been elected,” Soriano said.</p>\n<p>Senator Lupe Zelada said the independence of the student lobby was being attacked. According to Zelada, the A.S. President backtracked on a previous agreement.</p>\n<p>“I do have a problem with somebody attacking our autonomy in our election process, especially when Jonathan Abboud gave us his word that he was not going change that or touch that,” Zelada said. “He completely just backed out on his word, and I don’t appreciate that.”</p>\n<p>Other items covered during the meeting included a planned online marketplace for UCSB students to trade and sell textbooks called GauchoBooks, upcoming Human Rights Board elections and changes in and the transition between outgoing and incoming senators.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/","id":3009,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3008,3007,3006],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Organizations Lose Funds to  Pardall Center in New Budget","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Untitled.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Untitled.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite opposition from campus groups, the Associated Students Senate decided to pass the budget for the 2014-2015 school year, as proposed by A.S.

President Jonathan Abboud, which increased a “recharge” fee on lock-in fees that are given to specific organizations to give this money to the A.S. Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>Abboud’s budget proposed to increase the recharge on lock-in fees — which is a percentage of the lock-in fee allocated to fund building, leadership and tech reserves — from 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent. A portion of the recharge would go toward sustaining the A.S. Pardall center, for which the association has been seeking a permanent funding source, which drew criticism from several BCCs receiving lock-in fees. Additionally, Abboud proposed a reduction in funding for staff salaries, allocating $40,000 less than requested by staff members, which also drew criticism.</p>\n<p>Despite the concerns brought to the Senate, senators did not change Abboud’s budget except to transfer $3,000 from the senate unallocated fund to tech supplies. The budget passed 11-7.</p>\n<p>Kyle Trager, general manager at KCSB, said the reallocation of funds by Abboud was unfair since it reallocates money in a way that was not approved by students.</p>\n<p>“It is my understanding that this funding will come partly out of the lock-in fees that are allocated to each A.S. entity,” Trager said. “I would like to point out that the students who approved our lock-in fee approved it for KCSB’s usage and did not know that it could be used for this purpose.”</p>\n<p>Trager said he did not understand why, rather than increasing the recharge, the funding for the Pardall Center would not come out of recharges on new lock-in fees which have not yet been allocated.</p>\n<p>“There are a few new lock-in fees that received funding for the first time this year, thus … they have funds that wouldn’t be used by them for any A.S purpose,” Trager said. “My question to you is why were these funds not used for the A.S. Pardall Center?”</p>\n<p>Trager also said he took issue with the idea of cutting staff salaries.</p>\n<p>“I’d also like to give one final shout-out to the staff members that we work with every single day,” Trager said. “Our advisor at the station works crazy hours … I encourage you to strongly reconsider your cuts to staff salaries.”</p>\n<p>Marlene Moreno, Associated Students alumna and current staff member, also said she disagreed with the cuts to staff salaries during Public Forum.</p>\n<p>“If you cut admin salary … it’s not that your admin don’t support you,” Moreno said. “They support you, they get underpaid to support you … They might not be able to afford to actually stay.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting during Public Forum, co-chair of Student Commission on Racial Equality Hani Tajsar read a letter co-authored by himself and a number of other chairs and members of BCCs. The letter stated that BCCs felt unfairly treated during the process of creating legislation that directly affected them, and presented a list of demands to the elected officials.</p>\n<p>“We, the representatives of the undersigned BCCs, are deeply troubled by the lack of decision-making power BCCs hold,” the letter states. “It is appalling that Associated Students Senate and executives perceive BCCs as inefficient and incapable of carrying out our mission statements in the service of the student body.”</p>\n<p>BCCs demanded in the letter that senators rescind the A.S. bill to restructure, create a committee to research “a governing style that would allow for more BCC decision-making power,” and give BCCs the right to approve financial decisions regarding staff members, because “the majority of staff works closely with the BCCs,” among other things.</p>\n<p>During Abboud’s report to the Senate, he defended his budget decisions.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the alternatives to funding the Pardall Center through the recharge on lock-in fees were to either cut budgets on select groups, or to give up the center completely.</p>\n<p>“The three options in my mind you have are you can keep the recharge … you can get rid of the Pardall Center, or you can cut the budgets of the groups that are in the base fee — essentially SIIRC, creative media, student lobby, the different executive offices,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud also countered arguments against cutting staff salaries by asserting that other students lacked adequate information on the salaries to have an informed opinion on the matter.</p>\n<p>“The people who are upset or complaining … frankly aren’t qualified to comment on staff salaries,” Abboud said. “I’ve been working on this issue with [A.S. Executive Director] Marisela [Marquez] for over a year now, and I’m the only student who is allowed to know all the intricacies of staff salaries.”</p>\n<p>During the Senate discussion on the budget, Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus said he agreed with Abboud that taking money from recharges to fund the Pardall Center was necessary in order to ensure enduring use of the center.</p>\n<p>“I think that the way [the recharge] is what we have to do to keep it sustained,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Nikki Calderon advocated moving some money from the Senate unallocated fund, which exists in order to fund new projects that come up over the course of the year, to the funding of the Pardall Center to account for the concerns brought up at public forum.</p>\n<p>After a short discussion on the budget, senators moved into a vote, in which 11 senators voted yes, seven voted no, and none abstained, resulting in a majority in favor of passing the president’s budget.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, a Public Forum speaker further discussed the process of becoming a Community Service District with senators, and elections committee proposed amendments to their role during A.S. elections season.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/","id":3010,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3009,3008,3007],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
