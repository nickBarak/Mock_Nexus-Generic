Freshman redshirt setter Hannah Juley was her usual self, accumulating 10 assists in the first frame, right in line with her current average of 10.49 per set in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The second go was much tighter between the rivals, with four lead changes preceding a kill from junior outside hitter Raeanne Greisen to reach Cal Poly’s high water mark in the set, a 10-8 lead.</p>\n<p>A string of two Mustang service errors and two attack errors swung the score back into UCSB’s favor, a lead they would not relinquish for the rest of the set. Errors would be a thorn in the side of this Cal Poly team, as they went on to commit 11 in the set and 25 in the match, 10 more than UCSB’s total.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt put the team on her back in the set with four kills, including the game clincher, three of which were assisted by Juley.</p>\n<p>Griesen tried her best to keep the Mustangs in the set, piling up seven kills and contributing heavily to a late 7-1 run that would tie the set. A block from junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman and Sheffield followed by Grunt’s kill would seal the second frame for the Gauchos, however, putting the Gauchos in position to fulfill their first three-set sweep in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game strong with Sheffield and Juley starting the scoring with a shared block, followed by a Sheffield kill assisted by Juley.</p>\n<p>After a four point run, including back-to-back kills from Greisen, gave the Mustangs the lead, UCSB would play from a two to five point deficit until the final moments of the set.</p>\n<p>Down 20-23, the Gauchos found themselves in what has been a familiar position as of late: performers of two outstanding opening sets, but incapable of completing a sweep. The result was a heartbreaking comeback for Long Beach last weekend, and an unnecessarily late challenge from Cal State Northridge in the following match.</p>\n<p>Greisen brought her team to the brink with a kill assisted by junior setter Taylor Nelson, but this time around, UCSB was not to be denied.</p>\n<p>With Juley serving, the Gauchos would ride her endgame heroics to the tune of six straight points.</p>\n<p>First came a Grunt kill on an assist by Juley, who followed by setting up freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen for her fifth kill of the set. Allen only played in the one game, but was instrumental in the Gauchos’ offensive firepower to close the match.</p>\n<p>Following Allen’s kill, Juley was at it again with back-to-back service aces that tied the score at 24 apiece. Another Juley serve would eventually result in an attack error for sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden, giving the Gauchos an opportunity for their first conference sweep of the season.</p>\n<p>Juley would strike again, as her fifth consecutive serve would lead to a kill from freshman outside hitter Megan Rice, once again on her own assist.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would have three players finish with double-digit points, led by Ruddins who finished with a double-double on 10 kills and 10 digs, not to mention two block assists and two service aces.</p>\n<p>Seniors Grunt and Sheffield would also finish with 10 and 13 points, respectively, totaling seven kills each. Sheffield was also a monster on defense near the net with eight assisted blocks.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi racked up 15 digs, slightly above her conference average of 4.62 per set.</p>\n<p>Juley was the star of the match, though, as her 31 assists, two service aces, 11 digs, five block assists and two kills on five attempts proved her ubiquity throughout the evening.</p>\n<p>Greisen was unstoppable for the Mustangs, killing 15 attacks, though the Gauchos did a good job of limiting Van Winden (fifth in Big West with 3.80 kills), as she was held to a .069 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Katherine Brouker led the match with 16 kills as she maintained her position as one of the best liberos in the Big West and improved her digs per set to 4.34, third in Big West conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finally sit at 5-5 in the conference and will look to continue their excellent streak of play next weekend against UC Davis on Thursday, Nov. 3, and UC Irvine on Saturday, Nov. 5. Both matches are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-31/ucsb-splits-season-series-vs-mustangs-earns-sweep/","id":5435,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5434,5433,5432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Remain at T-Dome for the Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016.10.08_StephenManga_WVB-4-web2.jpg?resize=681%2C467&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team will look to win back-to-back conference games for the first time this season as it faces LBSU and CSUN.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team is looking forward to weekend matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge, facing both opponents for the second time this season.<br>\nThe Gauchos host the 49ers boasting a 12-8 overall record, 3-4 in conference after splitting a pair of Big West games for the second straight week.

We were really without Phoebe completely, and Lindsey played just a little bit since it was her first match back after hardly practicing,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “Even with the team we had on the floor last time, we felt confident that if we had cleaned up a few things, [the match] would have gone a different way. Now we just have more strength.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins will look to regain her early season magic as she continues to get her feet back under her after an injury derailed her contributions early in the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman — eighth in Big West play with 3.64 kills per set — and freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis — fifteenth in conference play with 2.76 kills per set — will accompany Ruddins in a now fairly healthy Gaucho attack.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will also be back after playing in some light action last weekend, and she, too, will hope to reproduce her early season dominance.</p>\n<p>The defense, as usual, will be centered around sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who continues to lead the Big West in digs per set with 4.72 and total digs with 326.</p>\n<p>The libero also earned her second Big West Defensive Player of the Week Honors of the season after registering 49 digs in two matches last week against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to use its home court advantage to its full benefit in hopes of extending its one win over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday into a winning streak.</p>\n<p>The longest streak it has put together thus far this season is fives games, which occurred in the earlier portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>When on the losing end of the spectrum, the Gauchos have not tended well, having been swept in six of their eight losses losses this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Long Beach State at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, and Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 22, with both games being played at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

First-year middle blocker Rowan Ennis would add a kill of her own, and two service aces early in the set from Lexi Rottman would aid an early 9-3 Gaucho lead.</p>\n<p>The 49ers would did their best to close the gap, but the Gauchos contained LBSU with an excellent offensive effort, out-hitting their opponent for the second consecutive set, this time .314 to .281.</p>\n<p>Sensing their backs against the wall, Long Beach came out firing in the third set, the most lopsided of the entire match and a decisive turning point in what had been UCSB’s night.</p>\n<p>UCSB was sloppy to say the least in the third, as they would produce their first eight-error set of the night, coincidentally <em>not </em>their last of the sort.</p>\n<p>Despite several errors early on, the Gauchos still fought to a 14-13 deficit, capped by a block from Rowan Ennis and Megan Rice.</p>\n<p>The train came off the tracks at that point, however, as a series of kills, including three from junior middle blocker Ashley Murray, and attack errors from UCSB would result in an 11-2 set-ending run for LBSU.</p>\n<p>The 49ers dominated the Gauchos in hitting percentage, racking up a .440 mark of their own while holding UCSB to a minuscule .000.</p>\n<p>After playing to an eight-point tie in the fourth, a five-point LBSU run would set the difference between the two teams for the majority of the set’s remainder. A late four-point run, including two kills from Lindsey Ruddins, would bring the Gauchos within three, but a kill from sophomore outside hitter Megan Kruidhof assisted by redshirt sophomore setter Missy Owens sent the teams to a fifth set.</p>\n<p>The tie-breaker was the closest set of the match, with neither team ever gaining more than a two-point lead.</p>\n<p>Kills from Chanel Hoffman and Lindsey Ruddins, accompanied by an attack error from senior outside hitter Nele Barber, put the Gauchos ahead 12-11, a victory against the Big West leaders seemingly within reach.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s resilient offense flexed its muscles once again, though, as Kruidhof killed two attacks, first-year libero Hailey Harward added another, and Nele Barber finished the job with a kill to give the 49ers a 15-13 set win, remaining unblemished on the season.</p>\n<p>Barber was the star of the evening, dominating with 22 kills on a .442 percentage, only three errors and 12 digs. She now stands at second in the conference with 4.17 kills per set in Big West play, and fifth with 4.23 digs per set over the same span.</p>\n<p>Missy Owens was yet again everywhere setting up her teammates, as her 45 assists added to her 11.37 assists per set against Big West competition, a mark that ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was back in early season form for the Gauchos, and her 25 kills (.361 kill percentage) were a match high. Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt also continued to improve after returning from injury, scoring 12 kills on 26 attempts (.308 percentage).</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi continued to lead her team on the defensive end with 16 digs, second in the match to LBSU’s Hailey Harward.</p>\n<p>The match showed the 49ers’ ability to come through in tough spots, as they continued their season-long winning streak in five-set matches, maintaining their storybook year and improving to 15-7 overall and 9-0 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite Friday’s heartbreaker, UCSB came out with a strong performance in its following match against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>A strong first set saw the Gauchos build a 24-16 lead, and despite a flurry of UCSB errors that got CSUN to 20 points, Megan Rice was able to finish the deal with a kill to seal the game.</p>\n<p>The Matadors were much more collected in the second set, playing the Gauchos to a series of ties before grabbing a 20-19 lead late. Two kills from Lindsey Ruddins as well as one from senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield would put the Gauchos up, and despite a short back-and-forth, they would hold the lead to gain a 2-0 set advantage.</p>\n<p>CSUN won a close third set 25-23, with no team ever gaining a large margin over the other. After blowing a 2-0 set lead on Friday, however, the Gauchos were not going to let another match slip between their fingers.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was UCSB’s best, as they produced a kill percentage of .407 on their way to a 25-17 win. A 6-1 run to start the set would prove to be the defining stretch; the cushion would be sufficient to suppress each Matador burst.</p>\n<p>Outside hitters Julie Haake (senior) and Aeryn Owens (sophomore) held down the offensive end for CSUN, with 22 and 16 kills respectively. Owens ranks fourth in Big West play with 4.03 kills per set, while Haake had one of her more impressive matches of the year as she normally averages 2.94 kills per set (14th in the conference).</p>\n<p>Owens added 15 digs, second on the team to junior libero Katie Sato, who accumulated 19 of her own. Junior setter Lauren Conati led the match with 48 assists and contributed a solid eight digs as well.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Sheffield produced a career evening, with nine kills on 13 attempts for an über-efficient .615 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>“We needed more offense and Liz was outstanding coming in off the bench for us,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “She was pretty much unstoppable out of the middle.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley was the ultimate teammate, creating opportunities for her fellow Gauchos all over the court on her way to 47 assists. After 57 in the match against LBSU, she now sits at third in the Big West with 10.50 assists per set against conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was again the offensive standout for UCSB, as her 19 kills led the team. She and Chanel Hoffman both rank in the top 10 for kills per set against the Big West, with 3.46 and 3.44 respectively.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have fairly consistently been able to beat teams around their record this season, while running into trouble against the more difficult competition.</p>\n<p>“It comes down to the little things,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “The discipline on defense, a little more effort in your own approach so the offense is cleaner. It’s remembering what’s working for you and resorting to the game plan, so it’s a lot of little things that combine to help you take that next step.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its postseason quest against division rival Cal Poly on Friday, Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. in its only match next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-24/ucsb-with-fourth-consecutive-split-result/","id":5433,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5432,5431,5430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Break Even in Conf.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB was paced on offense by junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman (team high 13 kills) and received important contributions from first-year middle blocker Rowan Ennis (nine kills), redshirt first-year Lindsey Ruddins (eight kills) and redshirt first-year Hannah Juley (23 assists).</p>\n<p>Juley has been dominant of the Gauchos of late, putting her teammates in perfect situations for kills. She remains fourth in Big West play with 10.50 assists per set but will face off against the most prolific setter in the conference, junior Taylor Nelson.</p>\n<p>Nelson has been a constant catalyst for success on this Cal Poly team, with 12.09 assists per set and almost 400 total in conference play. Last outing against the Gauchos, she recorded 36 assists in three sets of work, and will need to be limited if UCSB hopes to come away with a win this time around.</p>\n<p>The biggest beneficiary of Nelson’s hard work has been Raeann Greisen, whose 4.16 kills per set on a .334 kill percentage — only 35 total errors on 293 attacks — have made her the most efficient high volume scorer in the Big West throughout the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s defense relies heavily on the effort of sophomore libero Katherine Brouker. Her 14 digs were a team high last time out against the Gauchos, and she ranks fourth since conference play started with 4.25 digs per set.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, one of the two players she trails in digs over that span is UCSB sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi, who averages 4.59 digs per set. Petrachi also bested Brouker in digs in the first match between the teams, finishing with 15 on the evening.</p>\n<p>Gaucho senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will participate in what could be her final match against Cal Poly after missing the first contest with the conference foes.</p>\n<p>Newcomer Lindsey Ruddins has also made a huge impact, especially considering that she’s returning from injury. In fact, the freshman just won conference freshman of the week for the fourth time this season, most of any first-year, after averaging 4.89 kills per set last weekend and acquiring a .330 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are pumped for this weekend as their recent play as well as the upcoming opponent are providing all the inspiration they need.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the matchup,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “Obviously, it’s a rivalry game, so it brings out a lot of excitement and energy from our team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to San Luis Obisbo on Friday, Oct. 28, and the teams will play at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73492\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73492\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/gauchos-look-to-break-even-in-conf-play-on-road-vs-rival-cal-poly/","id":5434,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5433,5432,5431],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
