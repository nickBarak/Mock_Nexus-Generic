June gloom slowly creeps up, with the calendar bitching at you to get your life together while your hands desperately shove tequila shots down your throat in an attempt to shut your brain off and slow the clock down for just a few more hours.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry. I feel you. When anyone utters the words “Week Nine” I look around for the nearest sledgehammer. And taking a GE Spring Quarter of my senior year turned into the worst mistake of my college career, as I unknowingly signed up for a twice-a-week freshman social hour, where the question Have you thought about what you’ll do after college? is about as threatening to them as How many different pairs of pants do you think Santa Claus has?</p>\n<p>Not only is the end of the year a rough time for those of us who inexplicably don’t have a summer job after having applied for … no jobs, but it’s a heartbreaker for the spring fling-ers and the “This is definitely going to last the summer”-ers. Spring Quarter is like a magical, sexy, boiling stew of beer bongs and pantless fun, but like all other things, it must end. And when it does, it stings like a slapshot to the tender cheek of the unassuming frat pledge.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Damn does it hurt.</p>\n<p>For those of you with that special someone … Nah, nevermind.</p>\n<p>More appropriately, for those of you engaged in a non-specific sexual relationship that feels like a never-ending game of Twister — leaving you a little sore and a lot confused — well, my friends, you’re in for the clusterfuck of your life.</p>\n<p>If you’re getting down with a graduating senior, get ready to have your shit rocked.</p>\n<p>When you’re lying in bed Sunday morning with the words “So, once you graduate, what are we … ?” hovering above your lips, please, quickly think of an alternate ending, because that question is like Hiroshima to any fourth-year male with dreams of continued sexual prowess beyond college. They want to believe that nothing will change — that there’s no sudden need for commitment because of this “adult” status that they never actually signed up for.</p>\n<p>Yes, it will always be panties-off party night in the bro mansion, tapping kegs and spitting game in the land of babes and excess. And in Seniorland, the no-strings-attached mentality is more amplified than ever.</p>\n<p>And really, who can blame them? Last year, both my best friend and I received the “I’m a graduating senior” excuse, which at the time sounded about as reasonable as “I fell on her mouth.” But with the sage, newfound wisdom of my Spring Quarter senior standing, I can tell you that it’s an attitude I’ve begun to adopt myself.</p>\n<p>This stage of life is like a two-and-a-half-month-long trade-off between a war cry and a cry of terror. At first, you arrive at the glowing steps of Spring Quarter, eyes narrowed in determination, scanning the horizon for fresh blood and sniffing the air for the scent of Prestige. The war cry is issued. Then Week Five comes around and you’re cradling your alcohol-destroyed body, sobbing over your planner and cursing yourself for the moment you decided to pencil in a countdown to graduation right next to that inspirational quote printed at the top corner of every page.</p>\n<p>It’s a feeling I know all too well, and just the motivation I needed to say “Fuck it. YOLO.”</p>\n<p>All in all, h-in’ up with someone on the precipice of the real world can be an awful lot of fun. They’re game for most anything … anywhere … and ready to share their wild absurdity (as well as their bed) with their fellow classmates. But it can also be a rough ride — yeah, in that way too — for the younger ones, not fully understanding the mentality of the person who’s currently in or around their mouth (or any orafice for that matter).</p>\n<p>My word of advice: Share, but beware. As I was once told, we’re “not trying to hurt any feelings,” we’re just seniors. So YOLO, and check a few off the bucket list or help someone else get one in before their glory days are over.</p>\n<p><em>Jana Barrett has spent the last four years getting hard and going hard.

The activity is quite enjoyable, especially if you are as demented as me and my close friend and turn the experience into a party game, as it provides the opportunity to see just how twisted the psychosexual realm of this particular, somewhat troubling outlet of the gay population is. You will learn new terminology — Craigslist is like a crash course in gay code — as well as notice a very curious trend about the state of at least 80 percent of the under-24 population who has resorted to posting and posing their lust on the Internet.</p>\n<p>People are often shocked when I tell them I’ve hooked up with frat boys. They would probably be more shocked if I listed their actual names. There is a phenomenon in the gay community known as “turning,” in which a homosexual seduces a heterosexual. It’s not an uncommon thing, yet people never fail to be surprised, and often ask me how I do it. The truth is I exploit a weakness in our cultural logic. I exploit sexual fluidity, gender role malleability and our environment’s gluttonous fondness for casual, meaningless sex to expand the hidden desires of the “straight.”</p>\n<p>And, of course, I choose my targets well. I don’t (typically) choose the men who I know prefer women and “women only.” I’ve been in the game and was in the closet long enough to recognize people who have flirted with their own sexual confusion. Sure, I’ll occasionally hook up with someone I know will die the husband of some lady. But I would say that for the most part, I’m with someone who could just as easily marry a man and even maybe be happier for it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And yet, people still think I turn straight guys. So I will say it now: I am only turning closeted bisexuals and closeted gay men. I cannot speak about lesbians and I would rather be silent than wrong. But let us acknowledge this particular phenomenon, and examine the reasons, the means and the tools involved in maintaining the Closet Case.</p>\n<p>In 2012 California, one does not expect to be attacked by a governor’s son if they come out as gay. Still that decision often has great consequences. Coming out of the closet involves surrendering the following: claims to what has been culturally instilled in us as the fundamental masculine trait, virtually all available prototypes of ideal relationships, the culturally ideal relationship and what has been framed as a fundamental part of identity — one’s sexual preference.</p>\n<p>In shifting from “straight” to “gay,” one sacrifices an unspeakably large amount. For those gay men who prefer the shooting range to Forever 21, this sacrifice can be too great. Our gendered society has coupled the preference to have sex with women with strength, stoicism and the multitude of traits associated with masculinity. The coupling is so strong that I have heard “I don’t care if they’re gay, as long as they aren’t those faggy gays” in my own home, and variations of this sentiment throughout my interactions with “masculine” men.</p>\n<p>This implication is of course that being gay carries with it “faggy” traits. Neglecting these traits then is the only way to make your homosexuality palatable to the masculine hierarchs. I’ve known those whose friend groups consist exclusively of hyper-masculine, gym-obsessed men (behavior that is in itself a red flag for sexual conflict), and they would not compromise their entire social standing by coming out. Indeed, even people I know to be accepting of gays are horrified when I casually suggest that maybe the reason their bro doesn’t get with women very often is because he doesn’t actually want to.</p>\n<p>But even assuming that someone can define one’s masculinity intrinsically and not by an external code, there is still immeasurable loss involved in the coming out process. Those considering coming out must consciously acknowledge that they will never have access to the picture-perfect, Disney-portrayed relationships that pop culture views as perfect. You will never have nor be the prince and princess according to that cultural narrative. One of the most painful experiences, however, involves realizing that a woman who may already be in your life isn’t the one, despite how gorgeous and down-to-earth she is — no matter how goddamn perfect she may seem.</p>\n<p>So instead you face the unknown of constructing a relationship — a balanced, happy relationship — from imagination, trial-and-error and prayer. For masculine gays who are attracted to masculinity, they have no reference. In coming out they must admit to themselves that they cannot use basic relationship models to help them in their life. It’s a frightening revelation.</p>\n<p>And because our society is obsessed with sexual orientation classes, this choice is typically irreversible. Once you’ve admitted you’re attracted to men, you are gay or bisexual. My own sister admitted she wouldn’t feel comfortable in a relationship with a bisexual because she’d be insecure about his interests. My sister, for reference, is one of the most compassionate and liberal people I know. The corruption is deep — many do not have the prejudice, but many more do — and our strict system of sexuality forces those who want access to their same-sex desires to take on all the prejudices in their simple choice to be honest.</p>\n<p>So that’s the why, and now the how. The casual sex dominant in I.V. and the massive amounts of drug use allow closeted gays to remain hidden indefinitely. I have a fond memory of one of my straight friends talking about how his friend only hooks up with women when he’s “drunk enough” because his standards are so high. Yes, right, your heterosexual friend must get drunk to lower his standards, to make kissing the notoriously gorgeous women of Santa Barbara stomachable. The ones who are closeted can produce convincing illusions because they can simply drug their souls into oblivion and then play the part. After 19 beers, most people would have sex with a curvaceous oak tree, and yet since drunken sex is normalized in I.V. and emotional considerations aren’t even conscious thoughts, the illusion is perfect.</p>\n<p>By exploiting sexual fluidity and neglecting emotional desires entirely, the closet cases are in an ideal position to continue positioning themselves above women. And in 10 years, when partying can’t be their whole life anymore, they will have to face the truth and join the legions of late-in-life masculine gay men this country boasts.</p>\n<p>But, you know what? Fuck that. I’ve watched enough people suffer at the hands of our society’s weird sexual hang-ups. I’ve had friendships decay, relationships wither and potential flames flicker out because of the poisonous Puritanism injected into the sexual culture of this country hundreds of years ago. Every day, I reflect on the people I’ve known who still struggle to find that inner peace that will let them be as they are. Every day, I wonder if I could have done something different — crafted the right words to uplift the fearful — and become their shelter, and they mine. And every day, I maintain this vague hope that I can do better the next time I meet someone who is so deeply alone.</p>\n<p>But I know that I really can’t do anything to help the closet cases. The forces caging them are bigger than me. They are greater than any queer activist group. They are more obvious than Pride parades and more subtle than the difference between being happy and being at peace. Change of the magnitude required for true liberation won’t happen overnight, just like one night with a closet case won’t assuage his inner turmoil.</p>\n<p>Straight people: Be allies. Do not pretend to truly understand the challenges of coming out, but know your support can mean the difference between someone finding love in high school, and ripping apart a family in 20 years because Dad finally couldn’t do it anymore.</p>\n<p>Open gays: If anything in this article was new to you, please take it into consideration when you frame your activism.

T...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I spent a long while trying to think of what to write for my first sex article for the Daily Nexus, and as I thought about it, I was forced to think about what, exactly, a sex article should cover. There is the obvious: sex and my various escapades in the matter. But without any context I could not really think of a good way to frame my experiences. And so, particularly as a queer male, I think a good starting point would be to try to look critically at this thing called sexuality, try and pin down a good definition for it and maybe establish a solid perspective from which I can write intelligently about the subject.</p>\n<p>If someone asks me what my sexual orientation is, I tend to say I’m gay, but this doesn’t come close to covering it. For one, I’ve had sex with women — a decent amount of sex with women — and my fondness for female breasts would have gotten my homosexual license revoked if not for my ability to sing any song from “Wicked” on command. I like sex with girls, yet I still will identify myself as gay. So I asked myself: why not consider myself bisexual? I used to say I was bi, but now I just say I’m gay — why? This brings me to the first aspect of sexuality I want to look at: the difference between sex and sexuality. A crucial difference is the emotional aspect. Getting it on with someone isn’t exactly difficult, and most guys will rise to the occasion with the proper stimulation. But when I picture myself settling down, it’s with a man, and while I have loved many women, the only person I’ve ever been in love with did not have matching chromosomes. That makes me gay, right? Maybe, at least emotionally … for now …</p>\n<p>Like I said, I’ve already redefined my sexuality twice: from straight to bi, from bi to gay. Most people, “gay” or “straight,” will say that I took a natural path in coming out. This does not change the fact that out of my last three sexual partners, one was female, and she was easily the best in bed. And while I “came out” last May, my heterosexual escapade happened in December, so maybe I went back to being bi for a while. Or maybe, and I think this is the answer, sexuality can’t be nailed down as constant, at least with respect to me and I assume to many others. A wise man once told me “people are wavelength and varying,” and I am inclined to agree. When you add in the qualifier “people are wavelength, varying and horny,” it seems to be a recipe for some serious sexual ambiguity. This is the same sexual ambiguity that I rely on when it’s a lonely weekend, that straight frat guy who keeps “accidentally” bumping into me is pretty hot and my roommate is going to spend the night with his own lovely lady.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I suppose the point I’m trying to hit home is that from where I’m standing and from where I’ve been (horizontally), physical sexuality seems pretty variable. Controlling for consideration of homophobia, contemporary definitions of masculinity, early childhood conditioning and our country’s puritanical roots, the data would indicate whom you bed is very much in your head. I acknowledge there is a chance people are born straight or born gay, but if I’m forced to acknowledge that, I will, at the very least, demand this quantized system of gay-straight-bi be updated to a continuum model (1-10, with every decimal in between). But that’s not the whole story. If the psycho-socio-bio model explains every other aspect of human nature, why can’t nature only point sexuality in a direction, but have psychological and sociological factors define it? (A topic, perhaps, for another article.)</p>\n<p>To summarize and conclude, I’ll leave you with this: my roommate used to tell me a girl’s sexuality is like a wet noodle, to which I would respond a dude’s sexuality is like a dry noodle. Boil it (you can add alcohol for flavor) for a bit and it’ll bend pretty easy. Physical sexuality, dear readers, could be construed to have the structural integrity of pasta. Just think about it — chew it over — is all I’m asking.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/sexuality-flexibility-kind-flexibility/","id":6399,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6398,6397,6396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Your Dirty Little Secret Should Be Celebrated","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"One of my favorite shows is “Entourage,” despite its depressingly poignant way of reminding me that all of the fancy luxuries in my life are lacking.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One of my favorite shows is “Entourage,” despite its depressingly poignant way of reminding me that all of the fancy luxuries in my life are lacking.

Of course her presence on the show stimulated me to investigate her more mature content performances, and I have to say, I’m impressed.

We’re sexual creatures with healthy appetites for nasty shit just like you). I am by no means an addict, and I would never turn down physical intimacy with a partner to click my mouse alone, but I do watch porn and enjoy it very much. </p>\n<p>It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, and furthermore, it can be a healthy way to connect with your deepest sexual desires and turn-ons. The key is not to allow virtual imagery to completely overtake your fleshy fantasies in the sack and to separate yourself from the oversimplified categorization most e-porn is based in.

Yes, she’s that badass professor you’ve heard about who teaches a class devoted entirely to porn, but she also happens to be one of the most brilliant and engaging lecturers I’ve ever had the opportunity to listen to. What’s intriguing is that she studies and discusses something we’ve all been raised to crave yet scorned to enjoy.</p>\n<p>So why study pornography? Is it so we can actually beat off during lecture instead of wasting our time with Sudoku? Not quite. Porn is worth anal-yzing because it is more than just a teenage secret hidden in a wad of tissues. Pornographic material is entertaining, motivating, wide-ranging and dare I say, culturally valuable. It is at once escapist and hyperpersonal. In fact, the only thing it is definitely not is something to be ashamed of.</p>\n<p>Why then do society, largely governmental bodies and religious moralists equate the modern cyber masturbator with nothing more than a dirty leper guilty of criminal behavior? I believe the fundamental issue here is the vague nature of the idea of obscenity. I personally think it’s indecent and vulgar to spend 10 straight hours in front of a screen playing World of Warcraft. How is video game indulgence any more dangerous or crude than me rubbing one out to some onscreen bodily fluid exchange? Think about that one the next time you’re jiggling your joystick.</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve rationalized your porno-mania, before you use this newspaper to wipe the jizzle off your screen, let’s think about why you like what you like when you’re on a late night date with your computer and your hand. Since it is by definition meant to be vulgar, I tend to relate the porn films I like to the genre of horror. The scariest movies always capture my most wretched, unimaginable fears, so in turn, the pornography I enjoy usually depicts my most extreme, degrading, borderline unreasonable desires.</p>\n<p>What I want to get across is, if you feel grossed out about something you’re naturally turned on by, don’t take it so literally. Just remember that it’s meant to be hyperbolic — you don’t have to be hungry for some ass-stretching double-stuffage during your next hookup to enjoy watching it online.</p>\n<p>So sit back, pop in your Pirates collector’s edition disk and grab a hold of that lubed-up junk. Because the only unjust thing about watching porn is hogging your roommate’s bandwidth.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/dirty-secret-celebrated/","id":6400,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6399,6398,6397],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
