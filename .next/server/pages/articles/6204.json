What we need is a way to “go green” without consequently going broke. One student group has taken care to notice our growing concern and now labors in our stead to get us what we want.<br>\nFamiliarize yourself with them now. The conscientious members of the Student Food Collective, an Office of Student Life group, dedicate themselves to providing us with healthy, ecologically sustainable and ethically sound food while at the same time reducing our environmental impact and supporting our local agricultural economy. They place as equal an emphasis on educating about sustainable practices as they do in implementing them.<br>\nTheir current brainchild is called the “I.V. Food for Thought” project. Through close work and collaboration with Associated Students, SFC plans to provide us with two new excellent places where we can get our nutritious and affordable grub on. The first is a trendy mobile food cart substantially unlike the ones currently sprinkled about campus. SFC’s cart boasts a technologically superior design, powered via solar panel installations. Not only would it be a sick aesthetic addition to behold on our campus, but also a point of pride in the capability of student initiative and mindfulness. The second place is even more tantalizing. SFC plans to re-purpose the restaurant space at 6521 Pardall Rd. — across from Chino’s — into a lively sit-down café. Think of it as Natural Café meets Backyard Bowls and the Daily Grind. They envision it as a chill place to eat, hang and study while also serving as a venue for live music, group events and film screenings. The café’s menu will feature great tasting food that also emphasizes the importance of locally and ethically sourced ingredients. They expect the average meal to be modestly priced around seven dollars. Additionally, they plan to nourish an organic raised bed garden to use as a food source and as an educational workshop space.<br>\nAgain, SFC is in the business of serving us. What grows out of the “I.V. Food for Thought” project does not aim to seek profit. In collaboration with A.S., their goal is to provide a service to UCSB students akin to the A.S. Bike Shop. Student needs provided by student funds. Our Legislative Council has already collected $250,000 in favor of bringing SFC’s project to fruition.<br>\nFor around the last four years, A.S. has seriously entertained a student-run restaurant service on campus as an alternative to current options. It was natural, then, that they sought the guidance and advice this past Winter Quarter of the Student Food Collective. SFC’s robust vision for healthy and affordable sustainable food sources on campus meshed well with A.S.’s idea of a student run venture. Together, they are now engaging in early contractual stages of a five year lease at the Pardall locale. The bulk of potential Spring 2011 funds will be used for amenities typically associated with a restaurant start up, such as pragmatic and stylistic renovations, lighting, educational materials, furniture, inventory and staff wages.<br>\nWhy should we be excited about this? Why is the arrival of these services worthy of our anticipation? First of all, SFC’s is a rather novel endeavor. Through their efforts, we can come to represent a university whose students seek to boldly empower themselves, taking sensible initiative and control over what we eat and how it impacts us, our community and our environment. Furthermore, SFC’s proclaimed mission stands as one we back wholeheartedly: to foster a coalition of like-minded individuals and organizations co-creating, living, learning and nourishing spaces that embody sustainable practices in all aspects.<br>\nLooking toward our future, the viability of our current environmental practices appears grim. But, we, the most revolutionary generation in human history, can put the world on our backs. The efforts of SFC in collaboration with A.S. aim to “fire the first shots” of environmental sensibility. I, for one, am standing behind them. Where will you stand?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/student-food-collective-serve-isla-vista-affordable-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/student-food-collective-serve-isla-vista-affordable-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/student-food-collective-serve-isla-vista-affordable-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/student-food-collective-serve-isla-vista-affordable-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/student-food-collective-serve-isla-vista-affordable-food/","id":6204,"author":{"id":564,"name":"Brian Gallagher"},"related":[6203,6202,6201],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":564,"name":"Brian Gallagher","biography":"Not available","articles":[6204],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Prevention Replaces Justice as Priority One","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Osama bin Laden is dead, shot in the head during a courageous military operation in Pakistan led by U.S. Naval Special Operations Forces.

The news was applauded at home by raucous Americans outside the White House, at a Phillies-Mets baseball game and in small towns everywhere. The victims of September 11, 2001 have finally received justice. But even justice cannot provide complete closure for the families torn apart by Osama bin Laden’s crimes. “[I have] a feeling of happiness, but not jump-up-and-down happiness,” said September 11 widower Charles Wolf. “The idea of closure is something that really, really — it doesn’t exist, to tell you the truth.”</p>\n<p>We must not let our exuberance distract us from protecting our families, spouses and friends from future potential attacks. Even Sunday’s arrival of justice cannot replace the victims’ loved ones forever lost from their lives. Osama bin Laden’s and his followers’ crimes have victimized families in Kenya/Tanzania (1998), America (2001), Spain (2003) and India (2008). Sunday’s justice assuaged the pain inflicted not just upon America, but upon humanity worldwide. It was a somber day of justice delivered by America to families around the world.</p>\n<p>However, preventing future innocents from suffering is a much more demanding duty than executing a military mission. America and its allies must continue to dismantle, disrupt and defeat Islamist extremists. More importantly, America must continue to strengthen mutually beneficial relationships with all Muslims. No amount of air-drone strikes can defeat an al-Qaeda with an endless recruitment stream. Events like the Iraq War have only increased the number of terrorists working to kill Christians, Jews and Muslims in places like Madrid and Mumbai. Prevention is one of the most difficult duties, but it is also the most imperative duty because no amount of justice, not even Osama bin Laden’s death, can replace a loved one lost to terrorism.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/","id":6201,"author":{"id":568,"name":"David Kornahrens"},"related":[6200,6199,6198],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Chalk Slogans Create Straw Man","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I call attention to the various chalk protests we see on our campus walkways.

Some decry an unjust imbalance between defense spending and spending on education. These chalk slogans are classic examples of the logical fallacy, the “straw man.” In a classic straw man fallacy, attention is drawn away from the real issue by a dramatic rhetorical distraction. In this case, the authors of these claims are misleading their readers by diverting attention from real spending numbers.</p>\n<p>The budget figures in the chalk displays are claimed to be about 85 on defense and 5 percent on education. Sometimes (on the more honest displays) it indicates that these are percentages of federal “discretionary spending.” Mandatory federal payments include pensions, Medicare, welfare and state and local transfers. These make up more than half of federal government spending. Discretionary spending, including defense, highways and education, make up the rest.</p>\n<p>In the United States, almost all education spending is done at the state and local level. If one counts state and local spending on educational programs, as one must, then we find education spending is in fact higher than defense spending. For example, during the height of the war in Iraq in 2006, the total spending on education in the United States was $788 billion, while $622 billion was spent on defense. In terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), that is about 6 percent GDP on education and 5 percent on defense.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Is the University of California suffering from a funding crisis?

Finance Board broke the law<br>\nin an attempt to silence David Horowitz’s<br>\nfree speech.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When we asked Leg Council to<br>\nreconsider Finance Board’s decision, we<br>\nwere accused of being a privileged group<br>\non campus by one of the council members<br>\n— which is news to us — because we were<br>\n“white, straight males.” Our request of<br>\nfunds was compared to the Civil Rights<br>\nMovement — apparently providing<br>\nsecurity costs for Horowitz is equivalent<br>\nto supporting segregation — and when<br>\nA.S. finally allocated by consent $1,100<br>\nto cover only the security portion of our<br>\nrequest, Leg Council — being accused of<br>\n“Islamophobia” by a gaggle of anti-free<br>\nspeech protesters in the audience — went<br>\nback, breaking their own parliamentary<br>\nrules, to revote on the allocation. But the<br>\nallocation was passed by consent, a silent<br>\nvote — you cannot revote on a vote that<br>\nnever happened.</p>\n<p>When the five of us representing College<br>\nRepublicans finally left Leg Council, after<br>\nbeing attacked by the audience and Leg<br>\nCouncil members for five straight hours,<br>\none of my club members confided in me,<br>\ntelling me that he had never felt more<br>\ndiscriminated against and personally<br>\ntargeted in his entire life. He wanted to<br>\nraise his hand and tell this to the Leg<br>\nCouncil earlier, but he feared upsetting<br>\nthe council members and jeopardizing our<br>\nallocation.</p>\n<p>The UCSB College Republicans are<br>\nasking that the A.S. Leg Council formally<br>\napologize for the discrimination we were<br>\nsubjected to during that meeting, both by<br>\nindividual council members and members<br>\nof the audience who were yielded speakingtime<br>\nby members of the council, and for<br>\nthe breaking of parliamentary procedure<br>\nthat inappropriately reduced our funding<br>\nfrom $1,100 to $800. This is not a personal<br>\nattack on Leg Council — I know many<br>\ncouncil members personally and have great<br>\nrespect for them as individuals — but A.S.<br>\nis an elected board. College Republicans<br>\npay student fees as well, voted in the<br>\nelections and deserve to be treated with the<br>\nsame respect as every minority on campus.</p>\n<p>David Horowitz will come to this<br>\ncampus, whether we receive $1,100 or<br>\nonly $800 from finance board. We invite<br>\neveryone who so viscously opposed us to<br>\nrespectfully attend the event, but we ask<br>\nthat you act like mature adults and give us<br>\nand David Horowitz the same respect that<br>\nwe gave you at the meeting last night.</p>\n<p><em>Steven Begakis is a third-year political</em><br>\n<em>science and economics major and president of</em><br>\n<em>the UCSB College Republicans.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38086\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-06/college-republicans-question-legislative-councils-integrity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38086\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-06/college-republicans-question-legislative-councils-integrity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-06/college-republicans-question-legislative-councils-integrity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-06/college-republicans-question-legislative-councils-integrity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-06/college-republicans-question-legislative-councils-integrity/","id":6203,"author":{"id":506,"name":"Steven Begakis"},"related":[6202,6201,6200],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
