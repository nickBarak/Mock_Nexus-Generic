There is no doubt that the Gauchos would not be in this position if not for the stellar play of junior shortstop Keilani Jennings.</p>\n<p>Appearing in every game this season on her way to leading the team in doubles, walks and home runs, the Newbury Park native always expected to play softball collegiately. What she did not expect were the many hurdles she had to overcome once her dream to step onto the field for the Gauchos became a reality.</p>\n<p>“Coming in my freshman year, it was completely different,” Jennings said. “The game was faster [in college]. Everyone was more competitive and it was more serious.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A part of Head Coach Brie Galicinao’s first recruiting class, it was Jennings’ athleticism and strong arm that got the attention of Galicinao.</p>\n<p>“I saw her at one of the summer showpiece tournaments; I wasn’t planning to go meet her,” Galicinao said. “I went out and it so happened I was sitting in between two fields and she was playing on one and she caught my eye.”</p>\n<p>The decision for Jennings to attend UCSB was an easy choice for her, as she immediately fell in love with the campus upon her first visit and saw it as the perfect combination of scenery and education.</p>\n<p>“I picked UCSB when I went on my recruiting visit,” Jennings said. “The second I got to campus I just got that vibe that I knew where I wanted to go — I loved the location and loved the academic aspect of it. It was just a feeling I guess.”</p>\n<p>Jennings came into the program as a freshman ready to make an immediate impact, starting the first nine games of her career. However, Jennings suffered a devastating setback when she broke her leg, sidelining her for the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>“That was literally the first time I’ve ever been injured; I knew I wasn’t going to be able to play for the rest of the year,” Jennings said. “The second it happened I knew I broke my leg. It was definitely scary because I heard it crack and I was kind of in shock.”</p>\n<p>Despite suffering the season-ending injury, Jennings redshirted and returned the next year to lead the team in home runs and was one of three Gauchos to play in every single game, fulfilling the potential that was realized from her the year before.</p>\n<p>Building on her strong sophomore campaign, Jennings began the 2011 season by playing in 41 games and leading the team in batting average, slugging percentage and home runs. All was going according to schedule until injury struck Jennings once again. This time, a torn ACL sidelined her with another season-ending injury.</p>\n<p>“My second injury last year was harder; it was a different kind of feeling when you tear your ACL but I knew something was wrong because I wasn’t able to get up,” Jennings said. “It was really hard because your role as a teammate changes more as a supporter rather than actually being able to affect what’s going on on the field.”</p>\n<p>Yet, despite suffering another devastating injury, Jennings was determined to come back and play for the Gauchos in her final two seasons of eligibility.</p>\n<p>“I knew I would be able to come back,” Jennings said. “I wanted it bad enough to be able to come back and play. It’s the sport I love to play.”</p>\n<p>Now in her fourth year as a Gaucho, Jennings has not showed any signs of slowing down, playing a huge part in the run the team has made this season — a run that has UCSB within reach of a Big West title.</p>\n<p>“She’s come back from a lot; she’s been working hard and putting in the work necessary to come back,” Galicinao said. “Hitting in the fourth spot is challenging and she still has success hitting from that spot.”</p>\n<p>Because of her redshirt status, Jennings has the opportunity of becoming one of the greatest hitters in UCSB history before she leaves. Quickly climbing the record books, she currently ranks fourth overall for most home runs with 21, and has cracked the top 10 in doubles and runs batted in. However, even with a long list of statistical accolades to her name, Jennings still remains focused on the team goal of winning the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m not one to focus on stats,” Jennings said. “Coming into the season, obviously the big team goal is to be Big West champs. Individually, I just came in basically just wanting to play softball. I was mainly there for the team goal and coming in and focusing on everything little by little.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Championship to be determined in the final weekend of the season, the Gauchos hope to make program history. But, looking ahead to next season, there is also reason for optimism — as long as Jennings is penciled into the lineup.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/","id":964,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[963,962,961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Softball to Face Cal State Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a thrilling doubleheader sweep against Cal State Bakersfield last Tuesday, the UCSB softball team now draws its attention back to conference play, as the Gauchos go on the road this weekend to f...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a thrilling doubleheader sweep against Cal State Bakersfield last Tuesday, the UCSB softball team now draws its attention back to conference play, as the Gauchos go on the road this weekend to face UC Riverside in a three-game series starting Saturday.</p>\n<p>“Riverside is always an interesting series,” senior catcher Lainey DePompa said. “They’re very aggressive and they’re a scrappy team.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara heads into Amy S.

The Gauchos struggled early on in making adjustments against Bakersfield and look to put Riverside away early during their matchup.</p>\n<p>“We definitely need to make our adjustments a little sooner than we did [against Bakersfield],” sophomore first infielder Lauren Boser said. “Just keep working, hit the ball on the ground, put pressure on the defense and swing at good pitches.”</p>\n<p>First pitch for the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader is scheduled for 12 p.m., with the second game to be played immediately following.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46096\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/softball-face-cal-state-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46096\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/softball-face-cal-state-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/softball-face-cal-state-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/softball-face-cal-state-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/softball-face-cal-state-fullerton/","id":961,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[960,959,958],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Play in Final Series of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Two games behind first place Long Beach with one series left in the season, the UCSB softball team travels to Cal State Northridge today with the oppor- tunity to earn a Big West Championship crown.

With three other teams in conten- tion of receiving the conference’s auto- matic berth to the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos must sweep Northridge and have help along the way to win the pro- gram’s first title.</p>\n<p>“I feel good about our chances; I think we can come out strong against Northridge and sweep them,” junior shortstop infield- er Keilani Jennings said. “Our team is at a good place right now. We’re all clicking and as long as we stay within ourselves and play relaxed, I think we have a chance.”</p>\n<p>At 27-28 overall and 12-6 in confer- ence, the Gauchos have the opportunity to go over .500 for the first time this season with a sweep of the Matadors. If they sweep, it will mark the first time since 2008 that the Gauchos win 30 games in a season. Northridge, losers of five straight, come in 10-39 overall and 5-13 in league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB is currently in a three-way tie for second place along with Pacific and UC Davis. The Gauchos need Pacific to beat first place Long Beach State twice this weekend and have UC Davis lose at least one game to secure the conference’s at-large bid to qualify for the postseason. If Long Beach only wins one game, the possibility of a three-way tie for first place exists, with UC Davis winning due to head-to-head competition against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy that everything is coming down to this one weekend,” sophomore infielder Kathryn Pilpil said. “We have to do our job and hopefully the other teams can beat each other out so we can come in first in Big West.”</p>\n<p>Hoping to pitch the Gauchos into the postseason for the first time since 2007, freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom looks to put the finishing touches on her spectacu- lar freshman campaign. Already setting the school record for most wins in a season (21), Wisdom ranks No. 27 in the nation in strikeouts (227) and is seven strikeouts shy of breaking the school record for most in a season.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos to come out on top this weekend, they must carry over the offense they displayed last weekend when they scored 17 runs in a sweep of Cal Poly. Freshman infielder Jenessa Jeppesen bat- ted .700 with two home runs and six RBIs on her way to being awarded Big West Player of the Week honors. The Gauchos manufactured runs through singles and bunts, and plan to use the same game plan this weekend.</p>\n<p>With the entire season going down to the wire, all the pressure is on the Gauchos to execute. Yet, the team is ready to handle what comes its way.</p>\n<p>“They’re playing the best they have all year long,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “We have to play the softball we’ve been playing, execute on offense, play good defense, get some good pitching and win every inning.”</p>\n<p>First pitch at Matador Diamond is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/","id":962,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[961,960,959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Poly in Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final homestand of the regular season, the UCSB softball team was able to stay in contention for first place in the Big West as the Gauchos completed a sweep of Cal Poly at Campus Diamond last ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final homestand of the regular season, the UCSB softball team was able to stay in contention for first place in the Big West as the Gauchos completed a sweep of Cal Poly at Campus Diamond last weekend.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get that sweep,” sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil said. “It’s good we ended on a good note at Campus Diamond.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently in a three-way tie for second place in the Big West with a 27-28 overall record and 12-6 in conference, two games behind Long Beach State with only one series left in the season.

With runners on the corners in the fourth, freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom singled the runner home, and one out later, sophomore outfielder McKenzie Kane gave UCSB a 3-1 lead on an RBI single.</p>\n<p>Wisdom was able to take over the game, allowing only one other batter to reach base and striking out seven hitters total, pitching a complete game to get the win, 4-1.</p>\n<p>“We were so loose, even though the game was only a three-run win,” Pilpil said. “On the field, it didn’t seem like that even though it was only a 4-1 win, it felt much better than that.”</p>\n<p>More offense was on display for game two of the doubleheader as both teams combined for 24 hits in the matchup. Jeppesen gave the Gauchos a 1-0 lead in the second with a single, scoring the runner on third. Wisdom was victim to the long ball, giving up solo homeruns in the third and fourth innings to give the Mustangs a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Down to their last out and trailing 4-3, junior shortstop Keilani Jennings belted her team-leading sixth home run of the season to send the game into extra innings. Cal Poly failed to advance two runners on base in the eighth, setting the stage for Jeppesen to drive home the game-winning run in the bottom of the inning on her fifth hit of the day.</p>\n<p>“Our plans in the bottom of the seventh were to just push one run across and push the game into extra innings, and with one swing we were able to do that,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They really believed they were going to win that game.”</p>\n<p>Five seniors were honored in their final home game before the start of the third game. In the series finale, UCSB again came out swinging early in the game by way of the long ball; with runners on second and third, Jeppesen hit a three-run homerun for a 3-0 lead. UCSB added two more runs — one in the fourth inning and one in the fifth — as Wisdom dominated from the mound.</p>\n<p>Wisdom threw a complete game shutout, allowing only three hits and striking out at least one batter in every inning.
