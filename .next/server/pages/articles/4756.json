Last week, the Roadrunners upset the Gauchos’ nearly perfect midweek record in UCSB’s first loss in a midweek game.

The game’s winning pitcher, Gaucho freshman right-handed pitcher Chris Clements, pitched 1.1 innings and shut down the Roadrunner lineup in the bottom of the ninth to close out the game.</p>\n<p>“It was unreal. An hour later I’m still processing it. Talk about emotion, we thought we were going to win then gave up three,” Checketts said. “We were frustrated because we felt like it wasn’t going our way, and we were down to our last strike, but then Austin stepped up and it was pretty amazing.”</p>\n<p>Opening up the game for the Gauchos was junior righty Robby Nesovic coming off a previous hand injury. Nesovic pitched through 2.2 innings allowing three runs in four hits. Nesovic also recorded three errors.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos longest recorded pitching appearance in Tuesday’s game was from freshman lefty Kyle Nelson who allowed one run off three hits. Usual Tuesday starter junior lefty Domenic Mazza also made an appearance, but in his .2 innings pitched allowed three runs.</p>\n<p>“Nelson was fantastic and has been really throwing the ball well his last 20-25 innings,” Checketts said. “Mazza looked a little fatigued and had a hard time finding the strike zone.”</p>\n<p>The power that the Gaucho lineup wanted showed up in yesterday’s game, as the Gauchos put up 14 hits, including three doubles on top of the homer by Bush.</p>\n<p>Senior outfielder Clay Fisher  was not only among those who logged a double, but he also earned the Gauchos’ only stolen base. Fisher went 3-for-4 in Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>Senior third baseman Peter Maris was also among those with a double. Maris, now hitting for .319, went 3-for-5 against the Roadrunners and struck out once.</p>\n<p>“The guys did a good job of hanging in there after we have been struggling offensively for the past couple weeks,” Checketts said. “We were swinging when it mattered, but we still have some work to do. It was progress.”</p>\n<p>Bakersfield’s sophomore right-handed pitcher Steven Gee opened up the game on the mound and went through 4.1 innings, allowing five runs on eight hits. However, closer sophomore righty Max Carter was recorded as the game’s losing pitcher in his solo-inning appearance.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return home to face the conference-leader UC Irvine this weekend starting Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Vista.<br><em>Photo courtesy of wikimedia.org</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District and campus-based nonprofit La Escuelita hosted Safe Halloween this past Saturday, a free event for the children in I.V. held at the Children’s Park on Picasso Rd.</p>\n<p>The event included activities organized by various members of Greek life and booths decorated with festive items such as pumpkins, bats, ghosts, witches, confetti, paint, spider webs and candy. Activities at the event included a football toss, toilet paper toss, potato sack races, ring toss, fish pong, face painting, mini-golf and soccer bowling.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Recreation Coordinator Annie Aziz said the help of on-campus organizations made setting up this year’s event much easier than years past.</p>\n<p>“In the past, it was a lot harder because it was just I.V. Parks and Rec,” Aziz said. “I have much more support nowadays and it makes the event more successful and efficient. The on-campus organizations know how to organize, prepare and carry on events like this.”</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and third-year mechanical engineering major Lucia Arias said working Safe Halloween is a gratifying experience that causes participating children to “light up with joy.”</p>\n<p>“Many UCSB orgs participate and it is a heartwarming experience,” Arias said. “The kids appreciate it because it’s for them and they feel special since it’s a day catered to their fun for this holiday. They mostly appreciate how college students are around because they look up to us.”</p>\n<p>Lucia also said she hopes students keep other residents of I.V. — such as children — in mind when deciding how to handle this coming Halloween.</p>\n<p>“We as students do not really appreciate the space that we have in I.V.,” Arias said. “We can openly show families and residents that we are not here just to party. We want to acknowledge them through events like this.”</p>\n<p>Andrea Angulo, co-chair of La Escuelita and third-year Spanish and sociology major said Safe Halloween exemplifies a way in which students and other I.V. residents can come together in a safe, healthy and festive setting.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Safe Halloween that provides unity between UCSB, families and the children of Isla Vista to provide a safe space to Isla Vista,” Angulo said.</p>\n<p>Angulo also said children in I.V. do not get the chance to fully enjoy Halloween in their neighborhood because students are participating in “nightly parties inside of [their] community.”</p>\n<p>“From a kid’s perspective, it’s unfortunate to leave their community during Halloween day to have a good time. Isla Vista is simply not a safe place for children during this time period, especially during nighttime,” Angulo said. “I personally would not enjoy it if I were a kid and had to go trick-or-treating at a foreign neighborhood.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-grade student at Isla Vista Elementary School David Zamora said he has been coming to the event for the last few years and now recognizes some of the college students working at the booths.</p>\n<p>“I have been to this event since I was in third grade. I like the booths, the candy and the Halloween music they play,” Zamora said. “My friends come and I see familiar college students that I admire.”</p>\n<p>A mother of four, Isla Vista resident Janice Garcia said the presence of students throughout the day makes her feel better about the event.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a beautiful event because kids come during the day and there are fun games and candy. The fact that university students and parents are present during the day assures me that everything will be fine,” Garcia said. “I have lived in Isla Vista for 14 years and Halloween night can get ugly and sketchy. This is why I do not allow my children to be out during this time.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Sigma Chi Omega president Jason Ouyang said Safe Halloween promotes consideration for children and other I.V. community members and that students should take heed of the event’s efforts.</p>\n<p>“It’s unfair that kids can’t have a safe time during Halloween, and it might be selfish on part of college students since we are having constant parties and drinking which is not good,” Ouyang said. “I appreciate everything that these orgs are doing. I don’t know how they organize it, but they do it well. Each booth is decorative and I support this event.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/la-escuelita-treats-isla-vistans-to-a-safe-halloween/","id":4753,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[4752,4751,4750],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Town Hall Talks Representation","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IV-Town-Hall-church_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IV-Town-Hall-church_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"The office of Santa Barbara Assemblyman Das Williams held the third Isla Vista self-governance town hall of the year to determine the governance structure of a potential community services district (C...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61703\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61703\" data-attachment-id=\"61703\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/iv-town-hall-church_alex-nagase-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IV-Town-Hall-church_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425583392\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0769230769231\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Town Hall church_Alex Nagase-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IV-Town-Hall-church_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IV-Town-Hall-church_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61703\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IV-Town-Hall-church_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Community members gathered for the year's third I.V. town hall to discuss representation in I.V. self-governance.

A CSD is a form of local self-government, in which a given area can levy taxes to pay for certain municipal services through a locally elected board. The primary questions facing the group included the size and makeup of the governance board, how it would be formed and how members would be elected. Attendees split up into small groups and debated the finer points of these and other aspects of a governing board for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Options for governance board selection included discussions on whether or not the CSD governing board would be composed of at-large members, representatives elected by the entire district to represent the entire district, or district members representing certain geographic portions of the CSD and elected by residents of those portions. Other contentious issues involved the ratio of elected-to-appointed members of the board, with significant disagreements regarding the ratio of appointed or elected board members, as well as the boundaries of the would-be CSD.</p>\n<p>Williams began the meeting with a brief introduction on the goals of AB 3 and the public meetings occurring to flesh out the specifics of the bill language. The bill as it stands, according to Williams in a prior interview, should include language that provides powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission. The bill has until mid-March before it enters legislative committees in Sacramento, at which point it can still be modified.</p>\n<p>Groups primarily disagreed on the makeup of the board by numbers, with boards as large as 11 members and as small as five proposed by several of the working groups. A group led by Associated Students Senators third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez and second-year physics major Liam Stanton proposed a six member governing board with three ex officio non-voting members, possibly representing Santa Barbara City College, the university and the I.V. Property Owners Association, a majority of which would be elected by a margin of at least two members.</p>\n<p>“As far as the composition of the board goes, we felt that having the majority of the board be elected was absolutely essential to democratic ideals,” Stanton said. “There should be two more elected members than appointed members at least.”</p>\n<p>Stanton also said SBCC should be ex-officio but not voting because the college does not generate tax revenue for the would-be CSD. Lopez said the CSD board should be apportioned into voting districts with elected members ideally coming from different stakeholder groups in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If possible we would like the districts to be formed around the idea of one district more likely to represent a long term homeowner, one group more likely to represent a long term homeowner, a renter, perhaps a Latino renter, or both, one group more likely to do a student representative … and other two groups to be divided based on the areas that aren’t already in those groups,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and Open People’s Party chair Andre Theus said his group proposed a seven member board of four elected and three appointed representatives and favored an at-large basis for board representation and district boundaries including portions of West Campus and family housing.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think there should be people elected from certain districts, whatever the geographical terms would be,” Theus said. “There’s a lot of talk only including the box or square of Isla Vista; I personally thought we should include … the housing of those students, West Campus and faculty, because a major portion of students in the next 3-5 years will be living and centered near Santa Catalina.”</p>\n<p>One topic of debate at the meeting was the extent to which the university should participate in the CSD. Alumnus Alex Rodriguez, who graduated in December with a degree in political science, said the CSD does not need to include the university at all. Rodriguez said the last time I.V. residents proposed a CSD, the university opted not to participate in the process.</p>\n<p>“My problem is that UCSB has never cared about I.V.,” Rodriguez said. “They just bought up property so they can collect taxes in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Sasha Bates, a first-year history major and OPP candidate for off-campus senator, said although OPP does not take a stance on the CSD as a whole, he does believe the university should be part of the conversation.</p>\n<p>“I thinks it’s completely absurd to say UCSB doesn’t care about Isla Vista,” Bates said. “Isla Vista gets its heart and soul from the student population.”</p>\n<p>Bates said if I.V. does become a CSD, it should include the university as a stakeholder.</p>\n<p>“I think UCSB should have some role,” Bates said. “UCSB is an integral part of the Isla Vista community, be it faculty or students.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said he is personally in favor of involving the university in the CSD. According to him, incorporating the campus would help the CSD financially.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the talks we’ve been having have UCSB being included in our CSD, and that would be a big income,” Lopez said. “In the last few years they have definitely picked up on the amount they are interested in helping the community.”</p>\n<p>But Rodriguez said the university’s tendency to continue “pushing students off campus” has only lead to a housing crisis for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“UCSB and the property owners got us here in the first place,” Rodriguez said</p>\n<p>Molasses Jones, who lives in the Pescadero Lofts, said she is skeptical about involving the university within the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Adding UCSB to the fold is a bad deal,” Jones said. “They’re going to take over this little area that has opportunities to self-govern and create the environment that it wants to create.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said he favors elections by district divisions, and wants all members to be democratically elected rather than appointed.</p>\n<p>“I’m personally opposed to having any appointed members on the board at all,” Stanton said. “I think one appointee, but if we’re going to have to have one, it should be a student or someone from the administration of UCSB or SBCC.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said the district-based voting has the potential to represent different interests in I.V. and that different groups of residents, such as long-term, home-owning, low-income or student residents, tend to live in different parts of I.V.</p>\n<p>“UCSB students live certain places, SBCC students live certain places, and they have different needs,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Stanton, however, said he thinks there will be appointees on the CSD board due to pressure from the university and property holders or business owners who do not live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s inevitable we’re going to end up with one or two, because that’s the consensus,” Stanton said. “But I don’t like it.”</p>\n<p>Bates said he hopes to see an increase in student involvement with the CSD process than he has seen so far, based on an observation that very few students were present at the meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s always better to have more students involved in the community,” Bates said. “Whenever students turn up I think more can be achieved.”</p>\n<p>Another issue groups discussed at the meeting was how the CSD would represent I.V. property owners. Rodriguez and Stanton both opposed property owner involvement, but Lopez said it is necessary to include in the CSD.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t include them, they could use their money and resources to oppose our efforts,” Lopez said. “If we don’t include them and the CSD does go through, we could pass all the ordinances we want. But if the property owners don’t consent to something on their property, it could really damper what we can actually do.”</p>\n<p>Jones said she does not want companies who own property in I.V. to have control in the CSD.</p>\n<p>“The way Isla Vista has been in the past few years, I don’t think anyone who doesn’t live in I.V. should be involved,” Jones said. “They’re just collecting rent.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, including appointed positions to the CSD from university or property representatives take away from the idea of I.V. “self-governance.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t like the idea of giving control up to other people,” Jones said. “It’s called self-governance for a reason.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61709\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61709\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/","id":4754,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4753,4752,4751],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pizza with Police, Safety Coalition Respond to Deltopia Concerns","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pizza-With-a-Cop-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pizza-With-a-Cop-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Police Department (UCPD) in conjunction with Associated Students hosted Pizza with Police last night at Pizza My Heart in effort to address students’ concerns about law enforcement and comm...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB Police Department (UCPD) in conjunction with Associated Students hosted Pizza with Police last night at Pizza My Heart in effort to address students’ concerns about law enforcement and community safety for this coming weekend’s Deltopia event.</p>\n<p>The event followed a similar structure to the gathering with law enforcement preceding Halloween. UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa led the discussion, and four other officers attended to answer students’ questions in smaller groups. Deputies from Isla Vista Foot Patrol were initially expected to attend, but did not make an appearance. Questions about the I.V. noise ordinance, parking restrictions and roadblocks and the high number of cops brought in for Deltopia dominated the event.</p>\n<p>Signa opened the event by detailing the parking restrictions on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde, and encouraged students to buy on-campus parking permits and said the event’s purpose was to foster open dialogue.</p>\n<p>“The whole point of tonight is really just an opportunity for me to talk to you about Deltopia and what we are doing there,” Signa said. “It’s also — more importantly — for me to be available to you to answer any questioning.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD officer Alexis Dougherty said Pizza with Police is good way to educate students on Deltopia and other law enforcement matters.</p>\n<p>“If they have any questions about what’s going to go on this weekend, they can feel free to come up to us and ask openly,” Dougherty said.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Oliveira, a first-year global studies major, said she came to the event to better understand what Deltopia will be like.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year here, so I don’t really know what to expect at Deltopia,” Oliveira said. “I’m hoping this will give me more information on what is going to happen and on how I can make it safe.”</p>\n<p>Shiva Mozaffarian, a fourth-year biology major who had an involved discussion with Signa during the event, said she wrote a list of questions beforehand to ensure she could express her concerns.</p>\n<p>“I wrote them up because I wanted to make sure that I could rationally say all my frustrations about the police department,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she attended the event primarily to understand the perspective of police officers on Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that these cops are the police officers that I have problems with, so I just wanted to see if they shared that same issues that we have as the community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>According to Mozaffarian, some students resist the cops only because they want to party freely, but others, like those who attend events like Pizza with Police, want to offer useful criticism.</p>\n<p>“Some people have problems with the cops because they stop them from partying and drinking, but I think a lot of people are genuinely looking out for the well-being of our community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had questions about the special noise ordinance in I.V. for Deltopia weekend. The ordinance states I.V. residents playing music that can be heard from the street can be cited and given a $500 fine. Signa said the ordinance is meant to limit the size of gathering in I.V. residences.</p>\n<p>“As long as the music can’t be heard from outside, it’s no issue, and we’re not looking for that,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Jake Gorham, a third-year political science major, and Duncan Calvert, a third-year political science and history double major, organized the event in their roles as public safety coordinators for the Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). They started a volunteer force called UCIV Safety Coalition that will consist of 30 volunteers patrolling I.V. during Deltopia handing our water and warning students who may be at risk of citation or arrest.</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes that, if the UCIV program is successful, he and Calvert can turn it into a more permanent establishment to contribute to community policing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are really trying to advocate for community policing in Isla Vista, and we are hoping the volunteer program brings that out,” Gorham said. “It’s not going to happen overnight, but we are hoping for gradual change.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvert, the volunteer force will mainly focus on preventing noise-related citations and said they will help relay information about parking restrictions, but obeying the law is ultimately the individual student’s responsibility.</p>\n<p>“The volunteer force is hopefully going to mitigate all of the noise ordinance violations,” Calvert said. “We really don’t want students having misdemeanors on their records and having that bad experience.”</p>\n<p>Calvert said he hopes that the volunteer force will show UCPD and the IVFP that there are students actively seeking solutions for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The majority of police officers are dealing with our population at its worst,” Calvert said. “We are trying to create a good dialogue between the student body and officers who care and are committed.”</p>\n<p>Signa also said he supports Gorham and Clavert’s endeavor.</p>\n<p>“It’s better that students talk to students than that the cops talk to them,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes arrests will be minimal, but warned that there will be no drunk tank in I.V. and all students will be processed and sent to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>“If arrests do happen, we will be very strict as far as if you are drinking and publicly intoxicated,” Signa said. “With all the cops out there, there will be zero tolerance.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian however said she thinks the cops focus too much on arresting students for public drunkenness.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is that — after everything we’ve undergone — I think it’s been proven that the problems of I.V. are not due to the parties or the drunk students walking around minding their own business,” Mozaffarian said. “The problem is bigger than that.”</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes UCIV will help warn students that they are at risk for arrest for public drunkenness before they come in contact with the police.</p>\n<p>“The police have said it’s technically a no-tolerance policy during Detlopia,” Gorham said. “Our goal is to be able to give out warnings and give people a heads up.”</p>\n<p>A central concern among students at the event was the increase of police presence planned for Deltopia, but Signa said this increase is proven to correlate with lower crime rates.</p>\n<p>“The whole idea is we want to saturate the place and just be visible,” Signa said. “They are looking for people who might be causing problems that might be dangerous.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Signa said he believes the solution to I.V.’s fundamental problems do not lie in increased police presence.</p>\n<p>“As much as the police department and the sheriff’s department put in effort as far as having cops here, bringing in a horse team, and all this extra equipment, that’s only a band aid that doesn’t fix the problem,” Signa said. “The problem has to be fixed from within the community.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she understands the crime-prevention intention of increased police presence but said she is not convinced of its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really understand why we bring extra law enforcement, but still go after drunk students just sitting on a curb,” Mozaffarian said. “If the cops are here to protect and serve, they shouldn’t be victimizing the students.”</p>\n<p>After the event, Mozaffarian said Signa was clearly being “diplomatic” when he answered her questions and she said she appreciated his effort to work with students.</p>\n<p>“Mark is such an amazing guy,” Mozaffarian said. “He is one of the cops that prove that there are good cops out there with good intentions who are looking out for the best of our community.”</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes the dialogue between students and police can extend beyond Pizza with Police and special circumstances like Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“We need to represent you,” Signa said. “You need to be able to come to us and ask your questions — not just at Pizza with the Cops.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
