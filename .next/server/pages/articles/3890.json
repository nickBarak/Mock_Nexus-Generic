The foster homes will submit an online application process, and successful applicants will receive all materials needed to properly host their vacationing friend, donated by Lemos Pet Supply.</p>\n<p>The program began in December 2015, with a pilot program called “Santa’s Slumber Party.” Its goal was to find foster homes that could host dogs for two to three days, giving dogs a family for the holidays and time away from the kennel.</p>\n<p>“We had so much fun in December with our ‘Santa’s Slumber Party,’ and so many people have been asking when we are going to do this again,” Jeanne Saadi, community outreach coordinator for SBCAS, said. “We felt that spring break would be the perfect time to give our dogs another vacation from the shelter.”</p>\n<p>According to Saadi, although SBCAS tries to do this type of program two to three times a year, they are always looking for permanent homes for the dogs.</p>\n<p>“[We] are always actively seeking longer term foster homes, especially for dogs that need extra medical treatment, have been at the shelter for a long time or have some training opportunities that could be better addressed in a home,” Saadi said. “But we thought [the program] would be a good way to get people excited about doing that and maybe even foster some adoptions out of it.”</p>\n<p>While in the care of a host family, the dogs are given the opportunity to take part in different activities, such as going on hikes, going to dog friendly restaurants or spending quality time with someone in a home environment. These types of activities give the shelter staff and volunteers valuable information and insight about how each dog acts in a home environment.</p>\n<p>“The dogs get a change of scenery and a lot of personal attention, but they come back with more details and this allows us to set up the dogs for a more successful adoption,” Saadi said.</p>\n<p>After the initial program in December, two dogs were adopted by their foster families, and a third dog was adopted by a family because of new information the previous foster family had provided.</p>\n<p>Saadi said the process of becoming a foster parent for a dog begins with applying, followed by the shelter staff matching the parent “with a dog that will best fit their house.”</p>\n<p>“If they have another dog, we want them to bring their dog to see which one of our dogs gets along with best because we do not want it to be stressful for anybody,” Saaid said. “If they have a smaller home, then we encourage them to take a smaller dog, so we just try to match them with whoever is going to get along best.”</p>\n<p>Those interested in hosting a dog should contact Jeanne Saadi at the Santa Barbara Shelter at 805-681-4332 to host a dog seeking a vacation home.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/all-dogs-go-on-spring-break/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/all-dogs-go-on-spring-break/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/all-dogs-go-on-spring-break/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/all-dogs-go-on-spring-break/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/all-dogs-go-on-spring-break/","id":3890,"author":{"id":352,"name":"Stephanie Pernett"},"related":[3889,3888,3887],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":352,"name":"Stephanie Pernett","biography":"Not available","articles":[3890],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. - A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Watch Your Step</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. – A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling officer.</p>\n<p>The deputy went to check on the well-being of the 19-year-old and immediately noticed the strong odor of alcohol emanating from his person. The not-so-sure-footed partier had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, and his clothes were soiled in what appeared to be his own bodily fluids.</p>\n<p>As the deputy spoke with the now-seated man, he began to vomit vigorously. After he was done regurgitating his dinner, he slumped over to the side, almost landed in his own pile of vomit, and fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>The officer awoke the sickly man and continued questioning him, making sure not to step in the puddle of sick.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man what he had been drinking, and not surprisingly, the young man stated, “Tequila.”</p>\n<p>Having heard all he needed to hear, the officer arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Marking Your Territory</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:20 p.m. – Officers poking around a Del Playa parking lot came across a young man defacing a stranger’s vehicle.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 19-year-old UCSB student pulled down his zipper, whipped it out and began urinating on the side of a minivan. He was, however, too drunk to keep his balance and had to use the minivan for support as he relieved himself.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even with the van’s steady support, standing tall was just too difficult and the perp stumbled to the side and started peeing on his own leg.</p>\n<p>An officer walked up behind the man and told him to “zip it up.” Caught red-handed, the young man turned around and still tried to play it cool, telling the officer he hadn’t been urinating.</p>\n<p>His zipper was still down, however, and the officer told him once more to zip it up, which he eventually did. The deputy then began to question the young man, but he proved to be uncooperative.</p>\n<p>Judging that the man was unable to care for himself, the officer arrested the young pisser and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Deaf, Dumb and Blind</b><br>\nSat. Sept. 20, 12:14 a.m. – An SBCC student walking west down Del Playa Drive caught the attention of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Acting as if he were a human pinball and Del Playa was his alcohol-themed pinball machine, the 20-year-old man was bumping into people left and right as he attempted to navigate the busy street. He had with him a female escort, but not even a pinball wizard could have controlled his reckless walking.</p>\n<p>Then the unsteady stroller bumped into the wrong man, who got up in his face and started shouting. The deputies hastened towards the intoxicated man, hoping to get to him before he got himself into real trouble.</p>\n<p>The officers reached the young man and told him to sit down on the curb, which he did, and started asking him for his information. Due to his level of intoxication, however, he proved difficult to talk to. His speech was so slurred the deputy had to ask him to repeat answers several times before he could comprehend what he was trying to saying.</p>\n<p>He told the officers he had been drinking at a friend’s house and was heading to another friend’s house. Isla Vista’s Finest were forced to disagree, however, and arrested the man right there. He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/","id":3887,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3886,3885,3884],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat., Oct. 11, 1:17 a.m. -- An officer on a uniformed foot patrol of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive spotted a heavily intoxicated female being assisted by a male companion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When the Vomit Hits the Fan</p>\n<p>Sat., Oct. 11, 1:17 a.m. — An officer on a uniformed foot patrol of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive spotted a heavily intoxicated female being assisted by a male companion.</p>\n<p>Judging that the young woman was unable to walk on her own, the deputy stopped the pair and asked to talk with the inebriated woman. Her escort agreed and quickly left the scene.</p>\n<p>Without the help of her supposed friend, the 18-year-old out-of-towner was unable to maintain her balance and started to dry heave.</p>\n<p>Before the officer could assist the unsteady gal, she began to dry heave so violently that she fell to the ground. Once on the pavement, her dry heaving turned to actual vomiting and the shit hit the fan; she threw up in her hair, on her clothes and all over her legs and feet.</p>\n<p>After she was done upchucking her dinner, lunch and breakfast, the deputy asked her how much she had to drink that night, and she replied with, “I’m good.” Then she told the officer that she was having trouble seeing things.</p>\n<p>After five minutes of sitting on the curb, the officer asked if she could walk. She said she could try, but after two steps nearly fell to the ground. The officer assisted her to the street, where she threw up once more.</p>\n<p>Judging by the copious amounts of upchuck, the deputy placed the poor woman under arrest. She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Soggy Bottom Girl</p>\n<p>Wed., Oct. 15, 3:48 p.m. — Deputies enjoying a sunny Wednesday afternoon were called to duty when they witnessed a young lady struggling to walk near the intersection of Embarcadero del Norte and Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>The officers watched the stumbling stroller for approximately one block, during which she weaved back and forth, stumbled into innocent passersby and fell into a bush. She had another female with her, but she was not assisting the inebriated.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the 19-year-old woman, and immediately picked up on the strong odor of alcohol coming from her person.</p>\n<p>They asked the young woman where she was coming from and she replied that she had just left her sorority. She was then asked where she was heading, and she replied her sorority.</p>\n<p>When asked how much she had had to drink, she said, “Enough.” After speaking with her friend, the officers learned that they had come from the Phi Sig fraternity house, where the various sororities had been competing in a “gladiator style” sporting event.</p>\n<p>She was arrested and transported to the Isla Vista sub-station on Trigo Road. There she was placed on a chair in the holding cell, but after a half-hour of repeatedly falling off she was moved to the floor.</p>\n<p>Her intoxication seemed to be increasing, and at times she lost consciousness. Then, she began to urinate, soaking her shorts and the ground that she was sitting on. She made no attempt to move and ultimately passed out in a puddle of her own urine.</p>\n<p>The sorority girl was then transported to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for alcohol overdose, but was ultimately released back to the Sheriff’s Dept. and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/","id":3888,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3887,3886,3885],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Thurs., Oct 23, 5:50 a.m. — Custodial staff working an early morning shift at Ellison Hall on the UCSB campus called the police after coming across a young man asleep outside a door to the build...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Thurs., Oct 23, 5:50 a.m. — Custodial staff working an early morning shift at Ellison Hall on the UCSB campus called the police after coming across a young man asleep outside a door to the building.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s finest responded and found the inebriated subject lying upside-down on a handicap ramp. The deputies roused the man from his drunken stupor and assisted him to his feet.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the sidewalk sleeper if he knew where he was and he told them he was in front of Manzanita Village. A deputy directed his attention to the large academic building behind him and again asked the man to describe his surroundings, but the 19-year-old adamantly assured the deputies they were at Manzanita Village and that the offices in Ellison were in fact dorm rooms.</p>\n<p>The severely confused individual then told officers that he lived on Camino Pescadero, that it was just a short walk from Manzanita and that they should just let him walk home. Officers told him he was not close to Camino Pescadero and, despite assuring officers he was, asked if he could call his roommate to walk him home.</p>\n<p>The deputies said he could and he proceeded to reach for his phone. His phone, however, was not there and the still intoxicated man became confused and looked to the officer to ask if he had his cell phone.</p>\n<p>The deputy told him he did not have his cell phone, and instead arrested the young man for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Mon., Oct 27, 4:11 a.m. — At approximately 4:01 a.m., deputies received a report of an intoxicated man trying to gain entry into a house on the 6700 block of Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The concerned residents told dispatch that the man had begun by repeatedly slamming his body into their sliding glass door, and when that proved ineffective, had moved around to the front door and was banging incessantly trying to gain entry.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived 10 minutes later, they witnessed the heavy set 28-year-old man square up to the front door, push himself forward and, with considerable force, slam the entirety of his excessive weight against the wooden door.</p>\n<p>Despite the man’s sincerest and drunkest efforts, however, the door did not budge.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the man and told him to stop throwing himself at the door, which he did. The officers then asked the man — who, incidentally, works for KjEE FM in Santa Barbara — why he was trying to get inside in the residence.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the heavily intoxicated male did not have an answer to this question. In fact, he could not say where he was, how he had come to be in Isla Vista to begin with, or whose house he was attempting to enter.</p>\n<p>All he could say for sure was that he had consumed between five and eight beers that night.</p>\n<p>That was enough for the deputies, though, who arrested the man for public intoxication and allowed him unobstructed entrance into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/","id":3889,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3888,3887,3886],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
