To make the California Dream available to all, our state must be fiscally sound.”</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Board of Regents were quick to praise Newsom’s budget, calling it a “welcome step and a solid down payment” for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“These funds help further the academic mission of the university, from student success to classroom upgrades, financial aid to timely graduations,” UCOP and the Regents said in joint statement released soon after the budget plan was announced.</p>\n<p>Gov. Newsom’s funds for the UC are mainly split into three parts: $240 million toward an ongoing general fund, $138 million as one-time payment and $15 million to increase degree completion and programs at UC extension centers, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>The ongoing general fund will fund finance operating costs, efforts to increase student success, improving student mental health services and helping to address homelessness and student hunger; the one-time fund will address the UC’s deferred maintenance backlog.</p>\n<p>“These investments are provided with the expectation that tuition will remain flat, access will be increased, and time to degree will improve,” the budget states.</p>\n<p>This $400 million is <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/brown-signs-budget-act-of-2018-increases-funding-to-uc/\">an increase</a> from the $346 million that former Gov. Brown allocated in the Budget Act of 2018.</p>\n<p>Newsom’s budget took into account the UC’s “significant growth” over the past decade. Enrollment for the UC system rose from about 230,000 students in 2010 compared to 270,000 for fall 2017, a 19.2 percent increase, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>For UC Santa Barbara, this was 22,000 in 2010 to approximately 25,000 students for Fall 2017.</p>\n<p>Within the $400 million allotted, there is also a designated $5.3 million toward mental health services – with the goal of allowing campuses to hire additional clinicians –– and $15 million toward addressing student hunger and housing needs.</p>\n<p>Approximately $1.3 million for an immigration legal services program is also designated, to begin in 2022-23.</p>\n<p>The budget also included a $1 million fund toward supporting UC Davis’ Firearms Violence Research Center, beginning in 2021-22.</p>\n<p>Newsom will not sign the budget until June, after the California legislature has voted on it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Jan. 7, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence and Sofia Mejias-Pascoe can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

While some residents worry about a growing epidemic, other local organizers and prosecutors are committing themselves to decreasing gang violence in Santa Barbara and its surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>Gang Facts</p>\n<p>\tAccording to District Attorney Hilary Dozer, the southern region of Santa Barbara County is home to about five to seven major gangs and 1,200 gang members. He also said that while many gang members in the area are of Latino descent, the county also has its few white supremacist and black gangs. He also said that an all-female gang exists and is known as the Nightowls.<br>\n\t“We do have women that affiliate with gangs, but in terms of committing crimes, they’re less likely to do that,” Dozer said. “But I have been in court with some women [who committed crimes] that I would not want to be on the receiving end of.”<br>\n\tThe two largest gangs in the area are the Eastside Gangsters and Westside Destroyers that claim separate divisions of the city. Dozer said Goleta is mostly claimed by the G-13 (Goleta-13) and it has many subsets called groupings.<br>\n\tHe said, generally, the gangs get along except when they “slip” into each other’s territories.<br>\n\t“Gangs between Eastside and Westside Goleta are relatively even, but it could change six months from now,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tDan McSkimming, a senior deputy for the County Sheriff’s Dept. Gang Unit, said that other incidents occur when one gang feels injured or insulted by another.<br>\n\t“It’s almost always gang versus gang, or if not, someone’s in the wrong place at the wrong time, or it’s an associate that crosses them,” McSkimming said.<br>\n\tDozer said that while most gang violence is gang on gang, civilians can also get injured. The G-13 grouping called the Lakotes claim Isla Vista and are responsible for some of the gang violence near the university.<br>\n\t“Students need to be aware that crime takes place everywhere,” Dozer said. “Including the ivory towers of UCSB.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Crime and Punishment</p>\n<p>\tDozer said that three prosecutors, himself included, focus on gang crime.<br>\n\t“The D.A. targets gang crime with the highest prosecution,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tHe said gang-related crimes receive harsher punishments as the result of the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act. The S.T.E.P. Act was developed in the late 1980s in an attempt to deal with the tremendous amount of inter-gang war in Los Angeles County. Dozer said that in 1992, L.A. County had about 1,000 gang-related murders. S.T.E.P. made it criminal and prosecutable to be in a gang for a person who knows the gang is committing crimes.<br>\n\tDozer said that while he believes gang violence is at a high right now, it will lessen with the help of community members who report crime.<br>\n\t“In my 15 years of experience, gang activity ebbs and flows until it gets to a high point, which I think is now, but it goes away,” Dozer said.<br>\n\tMatt Sanchez, leader for the after-school youth program All For One, said he is a former gang member and that while most people think gang violence is an escalating problem, in Santa Barbara it is actually a small part of reported crime, with many of the offenders being minors.<br>\n\t“I call it youth violence because gang violence makes people think the public is in harm’s way, but it’s not against civilians, it’s gang on gang,” he said.<br>\n\tSanchez also said he first joined a gang when he was 16 and eventually became a leader of a gang called the Hoods. He said a lot of his family was also involved in gangs.<br>\n\t“It cost my brother his life and after that, hopelessness made me push the envelope. What was the point of going on?” Sanchez said.<br>\n\tHe said he served time for armed robbery, drugs, firearms and three times for attempted murder, though, he said, none of these crimes were gang-related. He said the only thing that made him stop was the fear that his children would follow in his footsteps.<br>\n\t“I saw my kids growing up and starting to emulate me, and I said no,” Sanchez said.</p>\n<p>Young Gangsters<br>\n\tThe average age of gang members is between 14 and 15, and it is not unusual for kids to start associating with gangs in elementary school, Dozer said.<br>\n\t“When you’re young, you’re put to work or do things for other gang members,” Dozer said. “But it’s not surprising to find gang members in their 20s. Longtime members are called veteranos.”<br>\n\tMcSkimming said the gang unit tries to influence kids in grammar school the most, since they are the most likely to join and are actually the most violent.<br>\n\t“The younger ones are often the most violent because they are trying to make a name for themselves,” McSkimming said. “The older ones are the shot callers, and the younger ones are doing violence to make names for themselves.”<br>\n\tVincent Castro, a first-year Santa Barbara City College student, said a great deal of his extended family was involved in gangs. He said he had trouble in his immediate family and was 10 when he first became involved with a gang.<br>\n\t“The gang was really my family because my family was not there,” Castro said. “I was 10 years old when a gang member got me high for the first time.”<br>\n\tHe said he was 14 when he started committing crimes for the gang and about 16 when he first met Matt Sanchez at All For One, formerly Hoods in the Woods. He said the workshops with Sanchez helped him the most.</p>\n<p>Juvi<br>\n\tYoung detainees charged with intense gang-related offenses are sent to the Santa Barbara Juvenile Hall. Facility Manager Karen Wheeler said the juvenile hall has 19 detainees filling the 20 single bedrooms available. She said while many detainees associate with gangs, only a few are actually in juvenile hall due to gang-related crime.<br>\n\t“Approximately 20 percent or less of the total number of minors on probation … are there for crimes that are gang related,” Wheeler said. “And a percentage of those in custody that claim a gang are higher than 20 percent.”<br>\n\tShe said the typical day in the life of a detainee involves going to school at the juvenile facility that teaches traditional high school subjects, participating in supervised physical education, having supervised showers and attending programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Wheeler said S.T.E.P. applies to juveniles as well.<br>\n\t“We have a zero-gang-tolerance policy,” Wheeler said. “The penalties are court approved, and the detainees know if they’re engaged [in gang activity] there’s a penalty.”</p>\n<p>A Solution</p>\n<p>\tFormer gang members Matt Sanchez and Vincent Castro are working together at the program All For One to keep kids out of gangs and out of juvenile hall. Co-created by Sanchez in 1992, All For One has about 50 members that meet every week, discuss their problems and participate in activities.<br>\n\t“We try to teach them responsibility. … We help them with their homework, find a school; we look for their gift, their special talent, and capitalize on that through education or working,” Sanchez said.<br>\n\tThe group consists of mainly high school-aged boys. Castro said he joined the group when he was 16 and now is the project coordinator. He said he thinks more programs like All For One would reduce gang numbers and that Sanchez helped him quit.<br>\n\t“When I went to juvi, I was just thinking, ‘Oh man, I let Matt down,'” Castro said. “He really motivated me to do right.”<br>\n\tCastro said he mentors a lot of the boys, going to the neighborhoods to recruit and educate. He said there is some hostility between kids from different parts of town when they first join the group, but the main rule in the program is to have respect for everyone, so they get over it fast. Castro said even he had a beef with a student at SBCC because he was from the other side of town, but they made amends when Castro became a leader for All For One.<br>\n\t“I told him, ‘We helped start it, homes, why can’t we stop it?'” Castro said.<br>\n\tSanchez said he has high hopes for the club and cares most about making the club sustainable so future generations can benefit from its programs.<br>\n\t“It’s easier to swim down current, but it takes somebody with real courage to swim against the current,” Sanchez said. “Sometimes it’s harder to do the right thing.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-14/gang-busters/","id":3563,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[3562,3561,3560],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
