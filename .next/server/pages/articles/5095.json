Despite holding the Rainbow Wahine to just one goal in the second half, the Gauchos fell by a final score of 8-7.</p>\n<p>“We started off the game a little slow but the second half was really good for us,” sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson said. “It was really special to see everyone so excited and fired up in the second half. It showed a lot of promise for the rest of the season and even next year.”</p>\n<p>The tough loss puts UCSB at 10-12 overall and 1-1 in conference play. Hawaii, who came into the weekend losers of four straight, improved to 15-9 overall with the win and 2-2 in Big West play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos were feeling good coming off of a road win in their first conference match of the season over UC Davis, but they found themselves in a highly-contested shootout early against Hawaii. The Rainbow Wahine scored four goals in the first period compared to three by UCSB and eventually took a 7-4 lead into the half.</p>\n<p>After a disappointing first half defensively, the Gauchos put together their most impressive defensive half of the season.</p>\n<p>“In the second half our defense was really strong. We were all working really well together,” sophomore utility Holly Smith said. “That was the strongest defense we’ve played thus far this season. A lot of people stepped up, and Miranda Schrader and Jenna Solberg scored vital goals.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defensive intensity rose to another level in the second half and trailed by just two after outscoring Hawaii 2-1 in the third quarter. The Gauchos were able to score another goal in the fourth quarter, cutting the lead to 8-7.</p>\n<p>“Our defense really stepped it up and we all really clicked in the third and fourth,” Hudson said. “We all rallied and came together. We are super young and just getting better every single game.”</p>\n<p>Trailing by one goal in the final seconds of regulation, UCSB was denied on two separate point-blank chances by Hawaii’s senior goalie Amy Carlson, preserving the win for the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>“We were very disappointed to lose this game but it showed us exactly what we need to improve on and how we can take on the coming teams,” Smith said. “We are confident going into our next game because each game we’re continuing to improve and working together really well.”</p>\n<p>With just three more conference games remaining this season, the Gauchos will now look forward to a match with No. 6 UC Irvine Anteaters, the team tied atop the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We learned a lot from this loss,” Hudson said. “If we run into Hawaii at [the Big West Championships], it’ll definitely be a different outcome.”</p>\n<p>The match with Irvine will begin at noon this Saturday at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Last weekend, Porter scored a season-high seven goals against No. 17 UC Davis, with three of them coming in the fourth quarter of what ended up being a close 11-9 victory.</p>\n<p>The remaining matches against Fresno Pacific and Villanova should prove to be favorable for a young UCSB team trying to find a rhythm.</p>\n<p>Fresno Pacific comes in with a 2-8 record.

In their only three matchups against ranked teams this year, they conceded an astounding 76 goals.</p>\n<p>In their final game of the weekend, the Gauchos will take on a Villanova team that has yet to win a game this season. At 0-8, the Wildcats enter this weekend’s tournament hungry for a victory after losing several close games last weekend.</p>\n<p>“Although they’re not ranked as high, we’re not going into it looking at it like that,” Martin said. “These are opportunities. We’re just going into it thinking that these are all games that we should win and we’re just going to have a mindset to win it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s first game against Michigan will be played on Friday at 10:30 a.m. in the Samuelson Aquatics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/no-18-ucsb-to-compete-in-final-preseason-tournament-of-the-season/","id":5092,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5091,5090,5089],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Finish Tournament With 3-1 Record","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB bounced back from a slow start to the season with a 3-1 record in the Cal Lutheran Tournament this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It has not been an easy start to the season for the No. 18 UCSB women’s water polo team, but after going 3-1 this past weekend in the Cal Lutheran Tournament, things are looking up.</p>\n<p>After a narrow 11-10 defeat to No. 16 Michigan, the Gauchos won each of their next three games over Fresno Pacific, Chapman and Villanova by double digits.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely getting better,” sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson said. “Right now our priority is defense.

Michigan went undefeated on the weekend, improving to 7-10 overall. Fresno Pacific went 2-2 and is now 5-10 on the year. Chapman is now 3-3 overall after going 1-2 in the tournament and Villanova finds itself at 3-11 after picking up its first win of the year.</p>\n<p>In their first match on Friday, the Gauchos took on the Wolverines looking to prove that they were a better team than their record might suggest. UCSB has struggled against the nation’s top teams so far this year, but it came out strong in this one with goals from junior utility Lauren Martin and sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson to take a 2-1 lead into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Both teams fired back and forth at each other, answering every run that was made. With the game close in the fourth quarter, goals by Martin, sophomore utility Jessie Porter and freshman attacker Carly Christian helped send the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>“Lauren did a really good job. She drew a lot of ejections for us and gave us a lot of 6-on-5 opportunities and penalty shots,” Hudson said of her teammate. “We just unfortunately couldn’t really convert, so that’s definitely a jumping off point the next couple weeks. We have a lot of time to work on our 6-on-5s because that’s kind of our weakness.”</p>\n<p>In the extra period, Porter was able to put away one more goal for the Gauchos, her third in the game. However, her team fell just short, giving up two overtime goals on its way to an 11-10 loss.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working on a lot of things that we need to do win games, like not letting other teams score out of two meters,” Hudson said. “We definitely struggled with that, but you live and you learn so hopefully that won’t happen again and we’ll get better.</p>\n<p>Going into its second game of the day against Fresno Pacific, UCSB came out on fire in the first half, scoring six goals in the second quarter to take an 8-1 lead. Thanks to their hot start, the Gauchos cruised to an easy 14-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Both Hudson and sophomore attacker Mackenzie Baber led the way offensively with three goals each while sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had nine saves.</p>\n<p>“We had a rough game against Michigan so I think that kind of sparked a fire under everyone,” Hudson said. “We wanted to prove that we were really better than all the other teams there so that definitely helped as a motivator.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB took on a Chapman team that had gotten off to a hot start to its season after allowing just two goals in its first two games. The Gauchos showed why they have one of the best teams in the nation though, as they completely dominated on their way to a 17-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Martin and freshman attacker Brenna Thomas each put away four goals to lead UCSB to its largest win of the season.</p>\n<p>Playing against a Villanova team off to a miserable start to the year, the Gauchos took advantage of the opportunity to get more of their players involved. Strong defense and a balanced offensive attack allowed UCSB to score a season-high 18 goals while giving up just five.</p>\n<p>No player scored more than two goals in this game and 12 players contributed at least one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have three weeks off before playing their next game at home against Harvard on March 22 at 12:00 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-finish-tournament-with-3-1-record/","id":5093,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5092,5091,5090],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes For Six Straight Games Saturday Vs.

We were all really confident so hopefully we will continue to win against Hawaii on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>When Hawaii comes to town, it will bring with it one of the most outstanding offensive duos in the country in sophomore attacker Paula Chillida Esforzado and senior utility Danielle Lewis. Esforzado leads her team both in goals (38) and assists (29) in just 19 games while Lewis has scored 37 goals on a team-high 49.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re really hoping to play very similar to what we did last weekend,” sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw said. “We’re a super young team and we were kind of scattered at the beginning of the year but now we’re all developing and knowing each other’s strengths so we can work together really well. We’re excited.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense has carried them in the last month. After allowing over 9.1 goals per game through their first 16 games, the Gauchos have decreased that number down to just 4.6 per game in their last five wins.</p>\n<p>“We want to play exactly how we played against Davis. That was our best game by far and if we continue to play like that then we shouldn’t have a problem beating Hawaii,” Smith said. “Each game we play we hit another milestone, and every game we get a little bit better. We’re just continuing to progress and that’s really exciting to be able to watch the team change and see that all the hard work is paying off.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Hawaii this Saturday at noon at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54576\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54576\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/","id":5094,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5093,5092,5091],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
