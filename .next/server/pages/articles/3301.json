CSD (pictured above at a meeting) agreed to do so in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this year. </span><em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Survivor Resource Center, located in the center of Isla Vista, provides a location where survivors of sexual assault can go to receive counseling, connections to medical, legal or police services and other services Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) generally  provides such as confidential counseling. For privacy, individuals can only receive the exact address of the center by calling (805) 564-3696.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s beginnings can be traced back to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when over 100 students engaged in a nine-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office calling for the university to accept 12 demands meant to reform how the school addresses sexual violence. The first of those demands directed UC Santa Barbara to open a resource center for survivors of sexual assault. UCSB did not end up opening a center, but Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) agreed to do so in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this year after it was approached by Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Community members wanted one place where they knew that they could send people or come on a regular basis as needed,” Elsa Granados, executive director of STESA, said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s 2 in the morning or 2 in the afternoon; we have a counselor available.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center strives to serve the entire I.V. community, not just students, according to Granados.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Often people think that when there are sexual assaults in Isla Vista, [they think] they only [happen to] UCSB students,” said Granados. “UCSB students do experience sexual assault, but there’s a greater community here in Isla Vista that experiences sexual assault. Low income families, monolingual spanish speakers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the center, STESA, which is based in Santa Barbara city but operates throughout the county, would send advocates wherever a survivor in need was. The new location offers a fixed space that survivors can walk into, rather than making a call, Granados said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STESA will pay exactly one dollar in rent a year to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), which is allowing them to use space in a building owned by Santa Barbara County that was previously used for storage and as an office for former Supervisor Doreen Farr before that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD spent roughly $5,000 in the lead-up to the center’s opening, buying furniture and renovating the space, according to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD. The money came from the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user utility tax granted by Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which the I.V. CSD didn’t have when they began working with STESA to provide the new center, Abboud added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our big contribution was acquiring the space and designating it for this purpose, and funding the upgrades needed to get it to be the nice relaxing space it is now,” Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center provides a variety of resources for sexual assault survivors, but STESA’s most commonly used service is a 24-hour hotline that survivors can use to call and connect with an advocate. Other resources include counseling, assistance with filing official reports or direction to medical services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center intentionally does not maintain a police presence, as some survivors may feel uncomfortable around police officers, according to Granados. Reporting to the police is an option STESA presents to survivors of sexual assault but does not pressure them to follow that course of action, Granados added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Someone might say ‘I don’t want to report to law enforcement, but I am worried about what happened to my body and I’m worried that I might have internal injuries’ and so then we can refer them to a medical clinic,” Granados said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 29 reported rapes to UCSB Police in 2018, according to the 2019 </span><a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/2019_Annual_Security_Report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act crime report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

It will be the third title defense for the reigning champion and the first fight in the year 2016 for both fighters.</p>\n<p>Via <em>Boxrec.com</em>, the best of the best are set to step foot in the ring, with Thurman rated as the No. 1 boxer in the USA and No. 2 in the world. Porter is just one spot behind Thurman at No. 2 in the USA rankings and No. 5 in the world.</p>\n<p>Similar to their closeness in ratings, the tale of the tape displays a near identical resemblance between the two as both differ by just half an inch in height and reach.</p>\n<p>Yet separating the pair of boxers is the one loss on Porter’s record. At 26-1-1, Porter has the opportunity to put an end to Thurman’s undefeated 26-0-0 record.</p>\n<p>While the legendary hard-nosed, toe-to-toe boxing matches from decades past are no longer as pertinent as they once were, the possibility of either boxer falling to the canvas is certainly ideal.</p>\n<p>More likely to deliver this knockdown blow is Thurman, also known as ‘One Time’ for his punishing hits. A total of 81 percent of his victories have been earned by knockout.</p>\n<p>Most notably, just four of his career 26 fights have been decided by a unanimous decision, while his other 22 wins have all been decided by knockout.</p>\n<p>Although Porter has achieved just 57 percent of his wins by knockout, he is more of a strategic fighter who looks to break his opponents down over the duration of rounds as he seeks that finishing head or body shot.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, a unique technique within Porter’s finishing realm of punches is this lunging hook/haymaker that he commonly throws when in search of causing real damage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wybyegEKS78?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A similar calculated, disciplined approach can be identified in Thurman as well, but it is his more aggressive approach which has allowed him to become the knockout artist he has proven himself to be. It is evident that Thurman isn’t afraid to gamble at times and make himself appear vulnerable while hunting for that power punch to end a fight.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRSap9PsVOU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>While it is too early to decide on a definite corner to support, my mind is telling me to side with Thurman and the entertainment factor he presents while my heart believes in the hunger of Porter, who has not hoisted a championship belt since enduring his first loss to Kell Brook in defense of his IBF World Welterweight Title back on Aug. 16, 2014.</p>\n<p>A decision on who to side with may never appear, but the anticipation for the June 25 bout shall continue to surmount, as it has the potential to be one of the best fights in years to come as professional boxing transitions from one star to another.</p>\n<p><em>All stats according to Boxrec.com.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/","id":3298,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3297,3296,3295],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Return: 2015-16 NBA Season Close-Up","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/basketball-fan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/basketball-fan.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"They're playing baaaaaaaasketbaaaaaaall!

Let’s be real: There will never be another day when the Charlotte Bobcats rank atop the Eastern Conference standings or the Utah Jazz, in a reputably tough conference like the West. Even the few minutes that allow starting players to get their feet wet and shoot the Spalding is exciting to watch with the 2015 NBA season just three weeks away.</p>\n<p>Certainly we have not been deprived of basketball since the Golden State Warriors’ 4-2 NBA Finals victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. From the NBA Draft, Free Agency, Summer League, Pro-Am tournaments, the Drew League, FIBA basketball and more it was an entertaining offseason leading up to now.</p>\n<p>A lack of defense and half-hearted play are the primary reasons many NBA players put up points in the 50s, 60s, 70s and more in these recreational summer league games. But the joy of these traditional five-on-five, my guys versus your guys, blacktop type of atmosphere that lives in these games is so enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Sure, the most minutes that a starting lineup might play during the preseason is the first quarter, but seeing the newest free agent signees, rookies, even the newest uniforms and sneakers on the court brings about an abundance of exhilarating emotions.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of a fan who genuinely admires the game of basketball, the most enticing thing about the return of NBA basketball is the fact that its best players will finally all be back healthy. As Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James and Anthony Davis each dominated the 2014-2015 season, and a well-deserved MVP was awarded to Chef Curry, things just weren’t the same without the Black Mamba and Durantula on the court.</p>\n<p>It has been a while since the NBA’s best players have all been healthy at the same time, and this season may be the first time in a long time that we get to witness the association’s top players night in and night out.<br>\nKobe Bryant’s field goal percentage suffered from all of his shot attempts, but the Mamba definitely has something left in the tank entering his 20th season. Can you honestly say that you expected Kobe to average 22.3 points per game, which at the time was third-best in the NBA, after tearing his Achilles in 2013 only to return and play in just six games before fracturing a bone near his left knee?</p>\n<p>Watching him and second overall pick D’Angelo Russell play on the same court in the Lakers’ preseason debut against the Utah Jazz was exciting despite Bryant’s 1-of-5 shooting performance in 12 minutes. All eyes are on the Lake Show and if they can rekindle the dynasty’s winning ways in hopes of sending Kobe off with one last playoff appearance in what may be the end of his illustrious career.</p>\n<p>I refuse to let this so-called “beef” between Stephen A. Smith and Kevin Durant spoil my anticipation of the 2014 MVP’s return to the hardwood. While Russell Westbrook had one of the best post-All-Star break performances, earning 11 triple-doubles, the absence of Durant definitely limited the Oklahoma City Thunder in their chase for the eighth seed. After reinjuring a jones fracture in his foot for the second time, causing him to miss 55 games last season, Durant was finally fully cleared for training camp this season and should be in the team’s starting lineup for the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Thunders’ first preseason game was yesterday. Durant played 22 minutes in the team’s preseason opener, scoring 15 points while shooting 5-of-8 from the field.</p>\n<p>Although not mentioned earlier, let’s hope that Derrick Rose’s fractured left orbital is the last of his injuries. Talent such as his is rare as Rose is the youngest MVP in NBA history.</p>\n<p>The 2015-2016 NBA season opens on Tuesday, October 27th. A total of three games are scheduled: Atlanta Hawks vs Detroit Pistons at 5:00 p.m. and playoff rematches between the Chicago Bulls hosting the Cleveland Cavaliers at 5:00 p.m. along with the Golden State Warriors vs the New Orleans Pelicans at 7:30 p.m.<br>\nBe sure to follow us on Twitter @thenexus_sports and expect more content from Around the NBA throughout the season.</p><div

Able to retain his current total of four Middleweight titles with his weekend victory, the question of who can stop Triple G’s reign remains.</p>\n<p>Fighting in front of a crowd of 16,353 roaring fans at the sold-out Forum in Inglewood, Calif. in addition to the thousands of fans tuning in by purchase of Pay-Per-View, this past weekend was a clear reminder that boxing is still king in the fighting industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming into the fight, Golovkin was the clear favorite with the odds in his favor. Wade was a +1600 underdog. Meaning, had Wade won and someone placed a hundred dollar bet on him, those that gambled on the 26 year old would have received a $1600 payout according to <em>ESPN.com</em>.</p>\n<p>However, the game of odds did not hold much significance in Saturday’s bout once the bell rung and the referee gave the signal for the clash to begin as Golovkin established his lopsided dominance from its very beginning.</p>\n<p>Wade, in his neon green Everlast gloves, attempted to establish the jab early against a fairly static Golovkin. In typical Triple G fashion, Gennady walked down his opponent and did not show much head movement in the early parts of the round, but Wade was unable to capitalize on Golovkin’s lax defense.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the round, Golovkin, a Kazakhstan native, landed a solid overhand right and dropped Wade for the first time with only ten seconds remaining in the opening round, marking the beginning of the end for the young American middleweight.</p>\n<p>Despite getting knocked down in the first, Wade seemed to have gotten himself back together as he entered the second round connecting with a flurry of punches, but Golovkin regained his composure showing some solid defense and continued to seek his opponent.</p>\n<p>Triple G took the punishment but seemed unmoved and responded a few moments later with a three punch combination that would drop Wade for a second time. The jab, uppercut and cross all landed with fervor and it might have been the end right there, but Dominic showed the heart of a champion by getting up and began exchanging once again. Regardless of the heart Dominic displayed, Gennady Golovkin wrapped up the night by delivering an unforgiving right hand on the button. With all that it was over.</p>\n<p>As Triple G added another consecutive knockout as well as another successful title defense to his already impressive resume, there was a question looming over everyone’s head: Will Saul “Canelo” Alvarez be the next opponent?</p>\n<p>For the sake of boxing, we hope so.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned in my colleague Sean White’s “Rebirth of The Ringside, Thurman Vs. Porter,” the sport of boxing is due for a major facelift. As the career of Manny Pacquiao nears its ending following the retirement of Floyd Mayweather Jr., the boxing industry is in need of a new ‘poster boy.’</p>\n<p>However, what my fellow counterpart has failed to mention is that the sport of boxing does not need to be revived; it has and always will continue to thrive. Perhaps to the casual boxing fan there are not enough stars in the sport to attract them to drop hard-earned cash to watch a hard-fought fight.</p>\n<p>Certainly, UFC and MMA has been a hot commodity over the past years, garnering the attention of many. But the truth of the matter is that both fighting organizations still have a long way to go. With regard to the vulnerability of all fighters in both MMA and boxing, it’s difficult to surpass the reality that the elite fighters of the UFC and MMA still make just a fraction of the pay day’s top prize fighters in boxing currently make.</p>\n<p>A fair question would be, why is it that there is such a disparity between combat athletes? I would propose to take a look at the popularity of the sports as a primary indicator as to how much each sport can afford to pay its athletes.</p>\n<p>The more paying viewers open to patronize the sport, the more the promotion has in profit, which in turn can find its way to compensate the fighters.</p>\n<p>According to a survey conducted on the discrepancy between the two combat sports posted on <em>sherdog.com</em>, the global authority on mixed martial arts, MMA has less avid fans than boxing.</p>\n<p>The amount of boxing fans weigh in at totals of 12,698,000, while the MMA fan base is at 12,219,000. Aside from the sheer numbers, it is when the demographics get broken down that there is a clearer understanding as to why one sport makes more money than the other.</p>\n<p>MMA has more viewers in the 18-29 age group than boxing. A total of 1,133,000 in that demographic have reported that they would prefer to watch Mixed Martial Arts. According to the same study on the other hand, the older age groups consisting of 30-44 and 45-64 would rather watch boxing. That is 853,000 more people with more money to spend.</p>\n<p>Even though the future is looking good for MMA, currently the demographic with the most disposable income would prefer to spend their cash on good ol’ fashion pugilism.</p>\n<p>Despite all the numbers, statistics, PPV buys and more, most people get stuck in a mindset of the polarity. For most people it is either or, but one thing is for sure. There is definitely enough room for the both of them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/","id":3300,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[3299,3298,3297],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
