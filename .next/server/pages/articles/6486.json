","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">In September of 2005, the <i>Nexus</i> released an article titled “The Rise of the Biko Empire,” praising the recent influx of, as it described, a “wave of artsy combustion from soft white underbellies” in their garage venue. Most of the article describes the orchestrated chaos brought on by unique and flamboyant bands in 2005.</div>\n</div>\n<div align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ending of the article caught my attention, as it asked readers the question, “What’s in store for the future of the Biko House?” Even though I believe the question refers to Biko’s musical scene, I don’t think the writer or any student in 2005 for that matter could have predicted how our world would be today.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I do not want to dive into the details of the United States’ current socio-political climate, but if you don’t know already, it’s bad. It has probably always been bad and my younger self just didn’t take notice. It might have been because politicians were more into dog-whistle politics than directly saying absurd, problematic things out loud. But whatever the reason, Biko’s empire has risen to the occasion and become more than just a musical empire. Keep in mind that my use of the word “empire” isn’t insinuating a single authoritarian rule but, rather, an expansive, all-encompassing multi-faceted entity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79633\" style=\"width: 2071px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"686434280\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79632\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79633\" data-attachment-id=\"79633\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/unnamed-1-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=2061%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2061,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79633\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=888%2C555\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=2061&amp;ssl=1 2061w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko was established to be a safe space for POC in a predominantly white institution, but it has evolved to become an empire of social change, music and solidarity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Time and time again, Biko has opened the doors of its black and brown empire for the community to discuss important racial happenings, like those from 2015.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After the racially charged incidents that occurred at the University of Missouri, Biko’s Garage was open to UCSB faculty and staff, students and local residents to discuss and stand in solidarity with the Mizzou protests. After the recent unfoldings of the presidential election, BIKO has served as an oasis of peace. Activism can be tiring, not just physically but mentally; sometimes that’s not something one wishes to bring back home. Many of Biko’s residents participated and continue participating in progressive work outside of the house.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Biko Garage, Isla Vista’s rectangular punk haven, is a cement room with capacity for maybe three and a half cars, or, on Friday night, 30 or so college kids with adrenaline to burn. Sound bled from the squat building as I approached it last weekend, my heart already in sync with the bass drum’s boom. “Wait!” called my friends, whom I’d started to outpace, but my legs wouldn’t listen. Biko zoomed up in front of us: two adjoined garages, one of which was closed but pulsing with noise; the other serving as a merch tent/lounge where some kids were hanging out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Drawing up to a table on which sat some flyers, a jar stuffed with dirty dollar bills and a pair of hairy forearms, I fished a $20 bill from my pocket and slapped it down, with maybe a bit too much gusto, as the owner of the forearms raised his eyebrows and gave me change. I stuffed the remaining $5 bills into the jar, and together we walked to the door, which was shaking. I gripped the greasy doorknob, turned it and leaned in. The four of us walked into the sun. We surfaced for air, joining the crush of people that had migrated outside, waiting for Genocide Jack. The crowd was, as a whole, black-shirted, lip-pierced and grinning—couple of camo swatches, a spark of Day-Glo hair.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During a particularly raucous song of the band’s set, lead singer Brian Bellrose crossed the invisible line between stage and stands, whirling around and bouncing off his fans. The zone surrounded me, a pink punk mist. Nothing else mattered. The only distinction between Bellrose and the people who’d paid $5 to see him was the mic, and even that he gave away, giving literal voice to anyone with something to scream. Most of it was indecipherable, but the message was clear, loud and nonverbal: energy so vicious that it’s often misconstrued as anger. This conclusion is evidenced by punk performers’ offstage impressions — I’ve never met one who was anything but gracious, progressive and kind. That night was no exception.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After a rousing performance of the Beastie Boys’ “Fight For Your Right,” accompanied by much floor-thrashing, crowd-singing and a heartfelt thank-you from the band, the show was over, and we tumbled back into the night, dazed and a little confused.</p>\n<p>Music, art and activism are what is brewed up in Biko. To continue to stand by its message, Biko additionally tries to prioritize women of color and POC musical performers, but it still opens its doors to everyone. We have seen the future of Biko that was conceptualized back in 2005, and it’s beautiful. Effervescent, colorful, strong and full of spirit; whether it’s the music pumping out of the garage or a presentation on vegetarian inclusiveness, Biko has become a platform for those without platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79632\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79632\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/the-biko-house-punks-progressives-and-politics/","id":6486,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6485,6484,6483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez","biography":"Not available","articles":[5783,6486,6558,6577,6584,6640,6682,6829],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Tribe Ties Gallery Synesthesia Trips Out Glass Box","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Visual Art","publish_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Glass Box was painted bright: intricate tie-dye tapestries layered the walls, each one unique in pattern, color and saturation.

The Glass Box, a creative space where students can showcase their art to the public, was painted bright: intricate tie-dye tapestries layered the walls, each one unique in pattern, color and saturation. Thomas Kenney, a fourth-year biology major and head of the Tribe Ties gang, paced the room, examining the pieces on display and interacting with the attendees. He not only gave histories of the pieces, but engaged the crowd in conversation about how they felt about the art or their days in general. He had an enigmatic energy; his beautifully tie-dyed shirt combined with a peculiar charisma marked him as an artist. When Kenney spoke of his art he said with a large smile that tie-dye for him is “capturing a moment in my brain to give to you.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71080\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1151412625\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71376\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71080\" data-attachment-id=\"71080\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/tribe-ties-gallery-synesthesia-trips-out-glass-box/tribe-ties-by-jenny-luo-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tribe Ties 5/17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-71080\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tribe-Ties-by-Jenny-Luo-online-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Looking at the pieces, one could imagine the creative turbulence in his mind and the minds of his compatriots, Jake Weeks, Kenny Oravetz and Will Shearer, all fourth-years. Some of the pieces looked like hallucinated Rorschach blots with thick drips of dye streaking across the once-white piece of cloth. One in particular looked like a psychedelic turtle. “There are different ways to tie-dye,” Kenney explained, pointing out the different symmetries of the various works. Some were bilateral, with two sides mirroring each other like a butterfly, and some were symmetrical quadrilaterally, where the sections showed themselves repeated four times in beautiful emulsions of color.</p>\n<p>After speaking about the appearance of the art, Kenney transitioned to explaining the historical roots of his unique tie-dye style. “My dad used to tour around America,” he laughed, “and would pay for gas and food with his tie-dye shirts.” His father developed a really powerful, vibrant style of dying the clothing that ensures vibrancy and allows for complex styles. The technique used to create the pieces is tedious. Different from the standard procedure, this type of tie-dye is done with one continuous string similar to fishing wire. It takes up to 10 hours to entwine a piece of cloth before it’s ready to dye. The dyeing process itself uses a special type of dye specifically formulated to fix color to cloth ultra-brightly and permanently. One of the most important parts, Kenney added, is the waiting process. Twelve to 24 hours is ideal. Weeks and Shearer both expressed that the waiting period is one of the hardest parts. “Do you see that one right there?” Weeks whispered pointing to a very large, almost fading tapestry in the center of the wall. “We didn’t wait long enough.” Also, it’s important to note that different materials hold the dye better. The large tapestry that Jake pointed out was made of cotton, while Kenney’s super vibrant shirt was a polymer blend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Vagina! Vagina!” as the UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theater Troupe rang in its annual performance of “The Vagina Monologues” on Friday night. Its successful opening night was one of three possible showings for audiences to attend, with two more being offered on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s “Monologues” spoke especially to the increasing diversity and individual empowerment within the feminist movement and within the production itself, but the MC’s did not fail to note that equal representation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">women — regardless of whether those women possess a vagina — is still something that the show has yet to achieve. Yet its monologues and Herstories (pieces written originally by their performers) that spanned different ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities, shapes, occupations and experiences seemed to mark a step in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The atmosphere in Campbell Hall was buzzing with excitement before the show. Some people were finding seats among their friends, while others were out in the lobby making purchases from an assortment of vagina-related merchandise that the production had to offer, which included anything from “Pussy Pops” to “Vagitarian” T-Shirts. All the proceeds from these purchases went to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center and the One Billion Rising Campaign, a campaign dedicated to ending violence against women. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two MC’s guided the show’s course, often prefacing monologues and Herstories by explaining their origins or to whom they are dedicated. They immediately made the show an interactive experience by getting the audience involved in the repeated chanting of “vagina.” If there had already been an excited feel in the theater before this moment, it was no match for the exuberance that vibrated throughout the entire hall during this communal chant. It was an exercise in turning the word “vagina” into one of triumph and pride, and it started the performance off in an enthusiastic way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no invisible thread pulling the monologues and Herstories along in a linear fashion — each story was unique from the one before it in both its commentary and in the character(s) who delivered it. Every monologue provided a different depiction of feminism and often did so in order to refute feminist stereotypes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Herstory “On Feminism” took every cliché of the feminist persona and targeted them against the performer: a sorority girl who wears bras and likes to have sex with men. She argued that these qualities do not make her any less of a feminist, as feminism does not represent a certain type of woman but instead represents a set of ideals that any individual can live by. In another monologue titled “Because He Liked to Look at It,” the speaker acknowledged the controversy of learning to love her vagina by seeing it through the eyes of a man who loved it first. As the speaker pointed out, this does not follow the archetypical portrayal of a feminist discovering her vagina (without the help of a man). Yet, perhaps these perspectives that do not fit precisely into the mold of what society deems as “feminist” are doing their part to break that mold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many of the monologues and Herstories combined humor, wit and metaphor to create messages of empowerment, others used grim anecdotes in order to reflect on the work that still needs to be done to protect women against sexual assault, both in the United States and globally. The monologue “My Vagina Was My Village,” for example, graphically depicted the story of a Bosnian refugee woman who had endured sexual assault at the hands of multiple soldiers over the course of a week. Some of the last words spoken in the monologue were, “I do not touch now.” The performance was a chilling reminder that for so many women throughout the world, the vagina is not associated with strength and love but with pain and suffering, both physical and emotional.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One characteristic that was constant throughout each of the performances was the passion with which they were delivered. Lines were often spoken with fervor, accompanied by unabashed moans and roaming hands if the moment demanded it. During somber performances, the distress and sorrow could be heard palpably in the speakers’ voices. This visceral emotion was especially present during “My Angry Vagina,” as the speaker paced across the stage animatedly venting about the entire existence of tampons. As she spoke, one got the sense that she had the voices of a million women who felt the exact same way speaking though her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After leaving the audience in hysterics with the classic “The Woman Who Liked to Make Vaginas Happy,” the show was ended with “My Revolution Begins in the Body.” As would only make sense, the body had been commented on frequently throughout the night. It had been explored from the perspective of different heights in the especially creative and insightful Herstory, “The Animal Kingdom of Femininity,” and its universal beauty had been reflected upon in, “An Ode to the Shy Latina.” Throughout the show, the performers had found beauty in every part of the body, and they ended the night with one simple command: “Go ahead, love.” </span></p><div

Architecture Museum on campus before Sunday the 29, you will find an array of paintings, sculptures and multi-media fixtures that fall decidedly in the category of abstract. Beginning on May 14, six art MFA graduate students at UCSB — Emily Baker, Vanesa Gingold, Morgan McAllister, Tom Pazderka, George Sanders and Shannon Willis — debuted their theses in an exhibition at the AD&amp;A museum, which held a reception on Friday May 20. You can go and see the exhibits Wednesday through Sunday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. (8 p.m. on Thursday). If you’re worried about “not getting” any of it don’t worry, there’s a lot of variety and plenty of the art is just plain cool to look at.</p>\n<p>The installations each entail several separate pieces, usually around five to seven per artist. They run the gamut with regard to subject and medium. Pazderka focuses chiefly on wood sculptures, found objects and charcoal drawings on tar paper. Pazerka’s exhibit revolves around famous (and infamous) individuals who spent time living in cabins in isolation. His subjects, each given a charcoal portrait in his piece “Freedom Club” range from the violent to the visionary. In “The Freedom Club Cabinet of Ted and Henry,” terrorist Ted Kaczynski (aka the Unabomber) shares a wooden fixture with transcendentalist author Henry David Thoreau. The piece, and the whole installation, suggests that madness and genius are linked. When asked about the message of his piece, Pazderka explained that he shied away from messages.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71235\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1467350012\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71474\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71235\" data-attachment-id=\"71235\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/mfa-exhibition-5-20-by-christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MFA Exhibition 5-20\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-71235\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MFA-Exhibition-5-20-by-Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“As far as a message goes, to me it seems like this distillation of an idea that is way more complex” Pazderka said. “That’s in a way how propaganda works — you take something that is way more complex, and you just keep distilling and keep distilling and then there’s this basic idea which then turns into ideology.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

\r\n</script> \n<p>Yet, ideology is ever present in the artwork. Books like <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism </em>and <em>Radovan Karadžić: The Architect of the Bosnian Genocide </em>litter the wooden frames and cabinets of the fabricated cabin fragments Pazderka uses. And the artist’s aversion to propaganda becomes ironic considering one of the Freedom Club members is Leni Riefensctahl, the infamous Nazi propagandist director (even more so given that her most noted work is <em>Triumph of the Will</em>, regarded as a masterpiece of both propaganda and art).</p>\n<p>Sanders’ exhibit features mainly sculptures, composed mostly of a few skeletal, architectural frames. There’s a clear emphasis on the line quality of the structures and the workmanship behind the materials. The constructions are made mostly of wood and rope, and demonstrate a contrast between the utility of these materials and the pure, non-functional aestheticism of the final art pieces. Sanders comes from a painting background, and several paintings accompany the sculptures. These images also depict the geometric gridlines that comprise the bulk of Sanders’ exhibit.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum from this extensive sculpture-work is McAllister. McAllister has several paintings on the back wall of the gallery in addition to a few wall-mounted, three-dimensional pieces. The paintings encompass large swaths of wall space; dubbed “Eleutheromania,” they are fairly conventional abstract images, boasting mainly hues and splotches of white, pink and red.</p>\n<p>Sharing the largest and most open museum space with McAllister and Sanders is Gingold. Gingold’s exhibit includes again mostly sculpture-work. Her surrealist-inspired pieces draw heavily on both the human body and insectoid structures. The acrylic, pigment and wood of the pieces “Private Viewing” and “Egg Case” all resemble bone and skin, or even possibly exoskeleton. A large centerpiece evokes a cocoon. Much of the material for this installation is abaca paper; the process of readying the abaca paper involves wetting it, beating it repeatedly and allowing it to dry and crack. The more severe the beating, the stronger and more translucent the material becomes. While Gingold’s pieces are abstract, they remain accessible. In some sense they’re delightful — all in shades of light pink and resembling mobiles you might put above a crib — in another way they manifest body horror straight out of David Cronenberg’s films, even evocative of Lovecraftian images.</p>\n<p>Diverging from the fixed pieces of her peers, Willis’ installation contains mainly video feed, played on either flat-screen TV’s or projected onto the wall. The bulk of her exhibit takes place in a dark room in a piece called “Falling in Love While Drowning.” The installation focuses more on mood than it does physical aesthetics. The video screens project images of a distressed Willis along with a young girl playing. The feeds imply some sort of tragedy, and largely suggest symbolism of time and progression.</p>\n<p>The final exhibit (although likely the first in sight upon entering the museum) entails both a sculptural and a performative element. Baker’s work is a tribute to movement and the human form. The centerpiece of the exhibit are the paint streaks on the wall that she left when she climbed up a gym rope covered in paint. The prints that her body left appear like large-lettered calligraphy in dark pigment in “The Ascent.” Surrounding the gym rope in the middle of the room are hip and knee replacements that Baker cast in bronze herself. Also prominent in the room is “Spinal Shift” a large, warped, yellow lattice-work made of latex, steel and bronze. Baker spoke to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about the nature of risk in the performance (both physical and ego-wise).</p>\n<p>“As a competitive gymnast you’re constantly showing and trying to be better, and to be better you have to be vulnerable, you have to allow criticism, which you have to do in art as well” Baker said. “There’s a lot of similarities in the gym that there is in the metal shop. You feel confident but you also might seriously injure yourself.”</p>\n<p>She continues to perform (although, sadly, not the painted rope-climb) by hoisting herself upside-down on the pull-up bar in an impressive feat of athleticism in the piece “Quiet Practice.” She goes every day of the installation at 3:30 [[p.m.?]] If you go, she’ll converse with you — there’s no artificial “performance” style of non-interaction.</p>\n<p>The overall verdict of the six theses is that while not every piece of every exhibit is amazing, many of them certainly are. Using many different forms and methods to cohere into unifying themes and symbols and images also creates a unique and immersive art-viewing experience. If you’re by the University Center, or on campus at all for the last few days of the exhibition, you would be wise to experience some amazing artistic talent and drop by the museum.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/grads-present-theses-at-ada/","id":6485,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6484,6483,6482],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
