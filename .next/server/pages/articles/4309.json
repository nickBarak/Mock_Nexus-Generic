SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, aimed at curbing the number of citations issued in Isla Vista, allows residents who have violated one of three ordinances — ordinance 36-2, consuming alcohol in public; 36-3, having an open container; or 40-2, playing loud music outside of curfew hours — the chance to wipe the violations from their permanent

been advertised in other programs Schroeder has created since taking the position of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s community resource deputy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must attend a class, typically taught by Schroeder and members of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department, and perform a number of community service hours. Guest speakers are also invited to talk to residents about the impact their actions have on others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from the program’s launch on Oct. 4 to Jan. 6, 58 people received citations for one of the three violations listed above. Of the 58 people, 49 signed up to attend the class; 31 have finished the classes but have not yet completed the community service portion, according to Schroeder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw a huge peak [in attendance] when it first launched, which was right before Halloween,” Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that there was a “significant drop” during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break, a period in which most students leave Isla Vista for the three-week gap between quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to be eligible to have a citation waived, residents must register for the program in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and have to complete the classes themselves within 90 days. Schroeder hopes to launch an app in the near future that would allow residents to sign up using their smartphones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical class is two hours long and begins with a brief history of Isla Vista, discussing more “high-profile” incidents that newer students may not know about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees also are guided through an interactive activity, in which they attempt to solve a community problem. Schroeder and guest speakers also explain why certain policies are in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that they additionally go into “how people can make safer choices when using alcohol and drugs — not necessarily telling them not to do it, but how to do it safely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has been a “mostly good mix” of UCSB and Santa Barbara City College students attending the classes, Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three classes have been held so far, and the typical class sees between 15 and 20 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schroeder also noted that citations issued in Isla Vista are down 50% from last year, a fact he attributed in part to Isla Vista outreach programs, such as the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which launched last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not lecturing these people — we really are trying to work with them to make sure crimes are reduced in the future. They’re part of the group solving the solutions,” he noted. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. <em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident was first </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/exb9tr/sigma_nu_is_disgusting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about to r/UCSantaBarbara, a subreddit for the UC Santa Barbara community, and was soon shared on various other UCSB social media spaces as well, including the Free &amp; For Sale group on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Reddit post, the user wrote about attending a Sigma Nu house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He asked her if “her friend in the red(me) Is a [transgender woman] because someone at the door let a [transgender woman] in” and it was his job to go find her. My friend said no she’s not and that’s so fucked up [of] u guys to even ask,” the user wrote, referencing the slur that the fraternity member allegedly used to refer to a transgender woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then he apologized and showed her the SNU group [messages] where someone had asked “who the fuck let that [transgender woman] in” and something along the lines of “kick her out” then he replied saying “I found a girl I thought was her but she’s not it. I’ll keep searching”.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reddit user who posted about the incident did not respond to a message from a Nexus reporter asking for further information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir was the first to bring up the post at the meeting on Monday, noting that many students had approached her over the weekend about the post. Sir asked Interfraternity Council President Jason Stone what the council was doing to address the complaints. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not actually aware of the details of that, but generally speaking, with regard to discrimination, it’s something we take seriously,” Stone said. “I’m absolutely ready to visit that as I’m able to understand that situation, but I’m not really aware of it right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), added that “notably our Greek leader retreat occurred this past weekend, so several leaders in the Greek community were actually not in Isla Vista during the weekend, so there’s some communication delay.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said his office had been notified about the post and had started to look into it, but was not aware of the poster’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alvarez stepped in to say that the Title IX office had also received a report about the incident, and had reached out to the user who made the Reddit post. She did not specify who made the report to the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve received some data and screenshots of some group chats so that is data we’re collecting, and we are trying to figure out what additional information is available and figure out next steps in our response,” Alvarez told the room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the office feels like it has enough information to move forward, Alvarez said it will conduct an assessment to see if the report falls underneath either the nondiscrimination policy or the Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t meet the criteria under those two policies, I’m unable to take action, but I will forward it then over to the Office of Student Life to potentially take action under additional codes,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said in an interview afterward that her office and several other offices had started looking into the incident, but since the only formal report was made to the Title IX office, that office is now in charge of the investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said at the meeting, however, that it’s difficult for the office to issue any disciplinary action in response to “speech infractions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Generally, even the most offensive speech is permitted by the law, and therefore [permitted by] our policy as a government organization,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we wind up in a position where we may not be able to hold a person accountable in terms of a change to their student status or a formal warning or something like that, but we do still have the opportunity as an institution to express our values, express our concern, to offer the voluntary education,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intersectional Feminists President Kyremina Youssef touched upon the incident in a later discussion during the meeting about timely notifications to the community, saying that while many students had seen the post circulating on social media, they hadn’t heard anything from administrators.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said she and others wanted to see a statement from UCSB administrators in support of transgender students and offering resources to those affected by the post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like students are just waiting on UC administration to say something,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said after the meeting that while she believes it’s important to “let the student body know how we feel about this and our values,” a statement from the university would likely come in her monthly newsletter as opposed to a campus-wide email from the chancellor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating, when this happens,” Armistead said. “It’s just so against our values, and it’s hurtful. We definitely can have some more conversations with all of our organizations to make sure that they’re inclusive, and that’s definitely something I’ll be proactive with.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

His controversial, often profane communications with his residents are frequently caught on video and published on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, Gelb was charged with a misdemeanor after he was filmed hurling a barrage of homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The video shows Gelb repeatedly calling Bertrand a “fag” and making lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told him that he treats his residents poorly. Bertrand, who is openly gay, serves on the I.V. CSD Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident received considerable local media coverage and Gelb faced widespread community backlash. Gelb issued a statement in response, attributing his lack of filter to Asperger’s Syndrome and accusing Bertrand of calling him a “pedophile” and a “felon” before the video began — a claim Bertrand has since denied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Days later, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley announced the county would charge Gelb with one count of disturbing the peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Gelb’s arraignment has been continually delayed. He has not been present at any of the hearings.
