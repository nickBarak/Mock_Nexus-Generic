After a tough 3-2 loss Friday night against Long Beach State, the Gauchos bounced back to defeat UC Irvine in straight sets on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State improved to 8-7 overall and 1-0 in the Big West with the win while Irvine dropped to 9-7, 0-2. UCSB now finds itself with a 6-8 overall record and a 1-1 record in Big West play.</p>\n<p>“We’ve improved greatly from our very first match,” said Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch. “I’m very excited about the progress that we’re making.

However, after a timeout, UCSB scored three straight points and ended up dominating the majority of the game.</p>\n<p>After breezing through the first set 25-19 and winning the second set 25-21, the Gauchos met their biggest test of the night in the third set. The Gauchos were able to prevail off a kill by senior outside hitter Katey Thompson, ending the set with a score of 26-24 and the game 3-0.</p>\n<p>“It was really important for us to get this win,” sophomore opposite Jaylen Villanueva said. “We just came out today with so much fire and so much intensity and we’re really excited for this win.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way for UCSB were Thompson and freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt with 10 kills each, while freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg added five kills and the team’s only block. Spindt also led the way with 14 digs as she continues to excel in just her first year with the team.</p>\n<p>“We kept our energy high on the court and we were able to shake off the balls that we missed,” Villanueva said.</p>\n<p>The first conference win of the season came on the heels of a tough loss to Long Beach on Friday night. In the fifth and final set, UCSB found itself tied 12-12 with the 49ers before conceding three of the final four points and losing the match 3-2.</p>\n<p>Thompson and Spindt led the way for the offense in this one as well, with 23 and 16 kills, respectively, and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau added 13 kills of her own. Senior Leah Sully made her first start of the season at libero, and she led the team with 20 digs.</p>\n<p>“Leah’s a great ball hander and unfortunately it’s putting her in a position where she has to pass the ball a lot for us,” Lantagne Welch said. “Tonight we just had incredible offensive production, hitting close to .400 as a team with so many players contributing, so that was definitely a credit to our passers, our setting and our hitters to be smart when attacking.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ends its home stand on Saturday when it hosts rival Cal Poly. The game will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52225\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52225\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-goes-1-1-at-home-to-open-big-west/","id":5308,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5307,5306,5305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Ready for Season Under New Head Coach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a disappointing record last season, women's volleyball is starting off a new season with coach Nicole Lantagne Welch at the helm.

After being picked No. 4 in the preseason coaches’ poll, the Gauchos ended up finishing tied for fifth in the Big West with a conference record of 9-9 and an overall 16-17 record.<br>\nLuckily for UCSB, this will be a completely new season with a very different looking team.<br>\nThis year marks a new beginning for UCSB volleyball as for the first time in 38 seasons Kathy Gregory will not be the team’s head coach. The legendary Gaucho coach, who holds the school record for winning percentage (.681) and won the AVCA National Coach of the Year award in 1993, retired after last season.<br>\nTaking Gregory’s place at the helm is Nicole Lantagne Welch, who is coming off a 25-6 season and a trip to the NCAA tournament at the University of Miami last season. During her time at Miami, Welch compiled a 243-120 record, giving her an impressive .669 winning percentage.<br>\nThe Gauchos come into this season as the No. 6 team in the Big West, as voted by the coaches. The biggest roster change for them will be in the middle, as standout libero Taylor Formico will not be returning to the team.<br>\nAs a freshman last season, Formico broke the school record for digs on her way to being named the Big West Freshman of the Year and earning a First Team All-Big West selection.<br>\nUCSB’s only other departure in the offseason was another libero in graduated senior Erica Lau. Filling in at the defensive specialist position will be sophomore Shauna Klein, backed by a couple of newcomers in freshmen Ella Roberts and Helen Gannon.<br>\nUCSB is looking strong on the wings with opposite Katey Thompson and outside hitters Leah Sully and Kara Sherrard all entering their senior years. Sully and Thompson were named to the First and Second Team Honorable Mention All-Big West last season, respectively. Despite having only three seniors on the team, the Gauchos will have plenty of solid veteran leadership.<br>\nThe remaining four incoming freshmen include outside hitter Ali Spindt and middle blockers Phoebe Grunt, Allie Sullberg and Kristen Berlo. Berlo, a double athlete who is also on the UCSB softball team, should be an exciting prospect to watch next season as she and the other freshmen compete for playing time.<br>\nAt setter, the Gauchos will welcome the return of junior Ali Santi, who led the team with 8.28 assists per game in 2012. Sophomores Jaylen Villanueva and Hanna Nielson will back Santi up as the only other setters on the team.<br>\nRounding out the roster are two liberos in Klein and junior Keely Stevenson, and three middle blockers in sophomores Britton Taylor and Elizabeth “ZZ” Meddaugh and junior Jordan Pehanick.<br>\nUCSB may have been predicted to finish in the bottom half of the Big West this year, but with a number of fresh new faces on the team and a strong core of upperclassmen, the team could very well make some noise in the conference.<br>\nThe Gauchos open their season this Friday against volleyball powerhouse Stanford.

Long Beach State has started 7-6, while the Anteaters are sitting comfortably above .500 at 9-5.</p>\n<p>While a 5-7 start is not necessarily a dream for the Gauchos, they are hoping their preseason tune-up games and weekly practices will help them get off to a strong start in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“This entire week has just been focused on game time situations and how to finish big points,” Sherrard said. “That’s something that we were trying to focus on in the preseason tournaments. We know Long Beach pretty well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have had a lot of changes since the end of last season, first with the departure of long-time head coach Kathy Gregory and next with the introduction of six new freshmen to the team.</p>\n<p>Replacing Gregory is new head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, who is coming off a very successful stint at the University of Miami.</p>\n<p>Besides the drastic change at head coach, there have been big changes all over the roster. Most notable of these changes is the departure of last year’s standout freshman libero Taylor Formico, who broke the school and Big West record for digs.</p>\n<p>“[Formico] did leave a pretty big hole,” Sherrard said. “We realized it was a big change, but we all just came together and figured out a way to get past [losing her].”</p>\n<p>The team also brought in six new freshmen, a couple of which have already made a positive impact on the court. Freshmen middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg lead the team in blocks with 37 and 32, respectively.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt has really hit stride early in the season, and is tied for the second most kills on the team with 102.</p>\n<p>“[Spindt] has already made a really big impact,” Sherrard said. “She’s one of our go-to [players] when it comes to kills.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Hanna Nielson, who was the Gauchos’ starting setter last season, has gotten off to a good start with 316 assists after just 12 games.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays Long Beach State in the Thunderdome at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, and UC Irvine at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/","id":5306,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5305,5304,5303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss to UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_006.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_006.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It seemed like 2011 was about to repeat itself.

Santa Barbara could not shake off its trouble on the road, finishing the season 4-10 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>After starting the season 3-9 in conference, the Gauchos posted a near-perfect record in March, including a seven-game winning streak to propel them into the seventh seed of the playoffs. However, Santa Barbara had a disappointing conclusion to its season and ended up losing four of its last five games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UC Irvine continues its run as the hottest team in the nation, extending its winning streak to six games. At 23-6 overall and 19-6 MPSF, the Anteaters seemed poised to reclaim the national title as they advance to the league semifinals against the third-seed Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB still has an outside chance of reaching the Final Four by earning the only at-large bid available, but their first round exit and overall record makes that possibility highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth first set ended up going to UC Irvine who had to fend off a resilient Gaucho attack to win the frame 26-24. UCSB responded as best they have the entire season, winning the second (25-22) and third set (25-20) to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite the lead, Irvine won the fourth set decisively 25-19 and built a five-point lead in fifth set, ultimately winning the final frame 15-10 and eliminating UCSB from the postseason.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht once again led the Gauchos in kills with 19, but Irvine was able to contain his offensive efficiency and limited Licht to a .205 hitting percentage. Licht added 10 digs and four blocks on defense.</p>\n<p>In his final game wearing the UCSB uniform, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis finished off his impressive career by recording six kills and four blocks. His 441 total blocks ranks third overall in program history.</p>\n<p>Irvine advances to the next round primarily on the play of junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. Tillie delivered on both ends of the court, finishing with 15 kills and seven digs. His three kills in the final set proved to be the difference as he delivered the final point of the match to send the Gauchos back home.</p>\n<p>The middle blocker tandem of juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring was effective in containing the Gaucho offense and held UCSB to a .213 hitting percentage for the game, compared to a .285 clip for the Anteaters.
