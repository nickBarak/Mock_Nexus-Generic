As I grew older, things didn’t change. My parents, my religion — my family is among the least Muslim of all Muslims, but they still believe that sex is to be had after marriage — and my community treated sex and sexual pleasure as an ugly facet of a person, something that was evil and wrong. </p>\n<p>Every time I thought about sex or felt sexual pleasure, I told myself I was wrong and impure and would go to hell because my body was feeling something it shouldn’t be. It was enjoying something dirty. I was dirty. For the longest time I felt that my body and I did not deserve respect or care because people who gave in to disgusting temptations didn’t deserve good things. Over time and through a series of experiences, however, I came to believe that sexuality was not a bad thing to have.</p>\n<p>As a young, impressionable thirteen-year-old, I learned about sex. My parents gave me the sex talk. It went something like, “Sex is used by adults when they’re married to make children.” That was it. That was my sex talk. It was understood that this was not advice or optional. This was the rule. “Sex is used by adults when they’re married to make children.” My mother did not say anything about sexual pleasure. Sex is for procreation, not pleasure. Around that same time, my family got an iPad. I was often allowed to use/borrow it, so I used the internet occasionally to satisfy my sexual curiosity because I knew my parents wouldn’t approve of or answer some of the thoughts and feelings I was having about sex. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I found websites that I really shouldn’t have been looking at as a young middle-schooler. When my parents found out, they screamed at me. I remember they told me I was disgusting. What I wanted to know and what I felt about sex was wrong. They were disappointed in me. That night changed the way I felt about sex for years. To have people tell you, from the moment you become curious about sex, that interest, that desire is immoral and wicked leaves a lasting impression. </p>\n<p>I spent years believing my body was betraying me by feeling things I wasn’t supposed to. I imagined my sexuality as an evil force in my body, placed there by God to test whether or not I could resist temptation. Whenever I couldn’t, I reiterated what my parents had told me to myself: I was disgusting. I was dirty. I should be ashamed of myself and my body. </p>\n<p>I now believe my parents’ lecture should have been about internet safety, not sexual curiosity, they grew up in a different time. They grew up in Pakistan, in a religion and in an environment in which they were taught that sex was to reproduce and nothing more. Their parents instilled in them a set of very traditional, very rigid beliefs about their bodies that they very much came to live and breathe. </p>\n<p>My environment, however, was in America. In America, sex-ed is about safety, not about waiting until marriage. The people around me and the culture naturally influenced the way I felt about sex and eventually the way I would come to feel. My parents, not understanding that, attempted to regain control of me by talking about my body the way their parents had spoken about theirs. I cannot blame them for reacting in such a way, because that must have been how their own parents reacted when it came to sex. Sex is not wrong. It’s normal. And as a young teenager, it was something I should have been allowed to think about it, but my culture shamed me for wondering about sexual pleasure. </p>\n<blockquote><p>To have people tell you, from the moment you become curious about sex, that interest, that desire is immoral and wicked leaves a lasting impression.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then, I began touring colleges my sophomore year, and I remember being in a hotel room with another Shia Imami Ismaili Nizari Muslim. We talked about the most taboo of subjects: sex. She was older than me and wondered on the most superficial of levels if she got married without sleeping with him, how would she know if he was good in bed? It was a small thing, but it started my “rebellious” thinking about sex. The summer before junior year, I went to a Muslim summer camp that taught confidence and self-acceptance. I became much more confident that year, and in the process I thought much more about whether or not my parents were right about sex. The summer before my senior year, I did some research, and I told myself that sex was not a bad thing. </p>\n<p>When school started, I talked to one of my counselors about it, and she reconfirmed what I very tentatively felt: Sex was normal. Thinking about sex was normal. I told myself this again and again, and I experienced sexual pleasure and orgasms without feeling guilty like I had in the past. As a result, I became a much more honest and open person and most definitely a much happier person because I knew I wasn’t disgusting or a freak or any other derogatory term my community assigned to people who thought sex could involve pleasure. </p>\n<p>I still wasn’t sure if I wanted to have sex before marriage, but one person told me something that tipped me over to the other side. She told me about a friend who had sexual experiences before she met the man she would marry. After marriage, she felt regret because she hadn’t waited to have sex with “the one.” Her advice to me was that if I was going to regret my experiences after marriage, then I should wait. As a person staunchly against regret, however, I believe a person’s experiences lead them to wherever — or whomever — they end up in life. </p>\n<p>Regretting who came before marriage might mean I never met my match. I also want to live life and experience all the experiences it has to offer me. I’m no longer against sex, before marriage, after marriage, whatever. As long as you take care of yourself and your body and treat yourself and your partner with respect, it shouldn’t matter when you have sex. If your partner doesn’t feel that way, then they might not be the one for you. The right person will respect you no matter what.</p>\n<p>My experience with sex and myself hasn’t always been easy. People, especially my family, have made it difficult. But that doesn’t mean that how I feel isn’t worth going forward with. I might have to fight every step of the way to say, “Yes, I am going on a date,” “Yes, I will be kissed,” “Yes, one day I will have sex,” “Yes, I will get birth control.” </p>\n<p>I have fought for all of these things, but that just makes them so much more important to me. These are my experiences — not my mother’s — that we’re talking about here. If you believe something in your life or a feel a certain way about something other people in your life don’t, that’s okay, as long as you don’t let their feelings get in the way of yours. I tell my mom all the time, “I respect your beliefs, you respect mine.”</p>\n<p><em>Komal Surani wants you to live your sexual life based on your own beliefs. </em><br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Every day one is bombarded with opinions of what our bodies should look like, from the mouths of magazines, friends and, sadly, even family members. Yes, the subject has been beaten to death — to a complete pulp — however, we still don’t seem to get it. No matter our physique, we still tend to want to be something different, but what happens when the time comes to bare it all as it is? Nothing else seems to cause as much anxiety as worrying about what you look like when it comes down to get busy with your significant other. You want to enjoy yourself, but instead you find yourself preoccupied with making sure you look like as close to a porn star as possible.</p>\n<p>The fact is, we can’t all have triple Ds or, in my case, even measly Bs or be skinny, curvy or thick all at the same time. We can’t all magically develop Kardashian asses — no matter how many squats we put in — and we don’t have to in order to enjoy sex.</p>\n<p>Many times I found myself wondering what made me look good when putting on my birthday suit, heck, even better! If I put my leg over here, if I twist there, will that show too much stomach? I need to sit up straight or else he’ll see too much. Enough is enough, people! Is sex not supposed to be about physical pleasure anyway? Turn off your mind and R-E-L-A-X! Indulge in your senses. Be in the moment. Clear your mind, and enjoy it without letting your preoccupations and worries get in the way. Again, you are doing something in the name of physical pleasure, so get out of your head — unless, of course, it helps you get there — and get it on already!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One way to not let your insecurities stop you from enjoying your sex life is to stop comparing your body to everyone around you. Seriously, sit down and reason with yourself, and you will see that this makes absolutely no sense. You are not that person, and so, obviously, you do not look like them. I’m not declaring a war on being fit or demeaning trying to look your best, far from it, but the only person you can be better than is yourself. Stop exhausting all your time trying to become your idealized girl/guy next door and try to see yourself as a separate, and just as good, human being.</p>\n<p>Another helpful way to get out of your mind and into your body is to really set the mood. I know, been there done that, and it has been repeated more than the whole meteor and dinosaurs on Earth story, but it does its fair share of damage. Play steamy music, darken the room, light a couple of candles. I know, it sounds cliché and mushy, but it works. It might not for everyone, but I guarantee most of you will be happy you tried it. Either way, just make sure to put the candles out when you people are done getting weird.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Make the room a little chilly so pressing against your partner will be a must to keep warm, and I don’t mean cold enough to rip through the sheets with your nipples, but you get the point.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Going hand-in-hand with setting the mood, start prepping for the deed way, way beforehand. Have a romantic night, go to dinner, take a shower together and watch a corny movie. Little things like this will help you bond with your man/woman and put together the mindset of all things lovey dovey, therefore pushing away all those little voices of judgment in your head. This will also get you in the mood and help you gain trust and intimacy with your partner in crime.</p>\n<p>Speaking of focusing on your physical senses, make it a playground for taste, feel, smell and touch in the bedroom, as well as any other freaky stuff you, you little sexy beast, you, may be into. Light an aromatic candle and use lotion to make each other smell awesome; use lubes and oils to massage each other before getting down to it. Maybe you have a favorite pair of sheets that are extra soft/fresh? Make the room a little chilly so pressing against your partner will be a must to keep warm, and I don’t mean cold enough to rip through the sheets with your nipples, but you get the point.</p>\n<p>Really feel your partner’s skin against yours, hold each other close enough to feel every inch of their body. Smell is a huge way to get you going, so ask your man/woman to put on some cologne, perfume or musky lotion. You’ll be devouring each other without a second, self-deprecating, judgmental thought in no time.</p>\n<p>Spoil yourself a little on the inside to try and feel good on the outside. Relieving stress and making yourself feel good is a perfect way to start feeling less insecure. Something as simple as winding down and taking an aromatic bath or even doing your nails with a different color will help beautify your image of yourself. Buy a hydrating mask and treat your skin to some softness. Treating your body and mind will work in harmony and help get out of your head.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best way to make peace with what you’re working with is to accept it, truly accept it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In spite of the fun of accessorizing sexy time with different things, one of the biggest things you can do for your sex life is to build trust with your partner. I am not insinuating that your boyfriend or girlfriend is a douche because you don’t feel like JLO when baring it all, but trusting your partner will play a key role in the way you feel when you’re au naturel around them. Fight your insecurities, and trust that at the end of the day your S.O. chose you. No one is holding him or her at gun point in order to get them into bed with you. Do you see any restraints? Threats being whispered into your boyfriend’s or girlfriend’s ear from under the bed? No, so just relax, and work together to build trust amongst each other.</p>\n<p>Many of these practices may seem superficial, and in part they are, without partaking in a key little something else. Truth is, you need to face your insecurities head on. Stop thinking that once you change this or tweak that you will be happy with yourself, because this is so very false. The best way to make peace with what you’re working with is to accept it, truly accept it. Simply ignoring it will not make it go away. Speaking from experience, even when ridding yourself of those certain attributes of yours, they will continue to lurk and haunt you unless you come to terms with them.</p>\n<p>One must really do a combination of things to truly enjoy sex. Sadly, sometimes we have trouble taking our own advice. It takes time, but a consciousness of avoiding certain blunders is necessary to stop what you are doing wrong. Knowing what not to do is the first step to eliminating the problem. Granted, simply distracting yourself with fancy lube and manly cologne to ignore the problem isn’t going to cut it. Once you have covered trusting your partner and relieving yourself from goddess or godlike expectations of physique, you will truly have fun in bed. Everything else after that is an accessory to make sex more fun.</p>\n<p><em>Scarlet Serrano wants you to relax, and enjoy the ride.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/","id":6288,"author":{"id":398,"name":"Scarlet Serrano"},"related":[6287,6286,6285],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Guide to Being Unapologetically Loud in Bed","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Scarlet Serrano explains why satisfaction under the sheets is a two way street.

One thing is for certain, and that is we should all learn to ask for what we want and how we want it during sex.

You are deserving of having just as much fun, which is why you need to stop moaning unless you really mean it. Here are some of the reasons why you might feel compelled to sit pretty and wait until your lover is done, and also the reasons why your assumptions are just so, so wrong. </p>\n<p>You are afraid to hurt his feelings. Don’t be. Whether he is the guy you met a couple of minutes ago at your friend Britney’s keg party or the guy you see yourself living with, thirty kids deep into marriage, your partner is a big boy — he can take it. Some guys may occasionally be upset to learn they were not pleasing you, but most of the time they will be happy you trusted them in the first place and will be eager to do what feels good for you. Most guys probably don’t even realize that what they’re doing is not working for you, so it is up to you to change that. If he doesn’t care to please you like the sex goddess you are, maybe it’s time to find another buddy for your nightly activities. </p>\n<p>You feel guilty and even greedy asking for what you like because it makes you feel like an entitled brat. Newsflash, you are not a monster for wanting to have fun with your sexual partner. In fact, you should think yourself a better person for respecting yourself enough to speak up in the name of good sex; you have realized it is about the pleasure of both and not just the one. It’s not your fault the repetitive motion or your head banging up against the wall, or the car windshield just aren’t doing it for you. Sure, it may not always be this obvious or severe, but that doesn’t mean you are not allowed to say something about it.</p>\n<p>It feels weird to ask for sexual favors. I mean, his man parts are in your woman parts, so the worse has come to pass, what is a little “can I get it just a little bit harder,” going to do? It is understandable that sometimes it can be a little weird to ask for things that you hear in corny movies and bad porn clips. At least to me, “a little to the left and harder,” and “yeah, right there baby, don’t stop!” seldom exited my lips with much ease, especially not with a new partner. With time and practice though, you will be talking dirty like a pro.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If he doesn’t care to please you like the sex goddess you are, maybe it’s time to find another buddy for your nightly activities. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Do you like getting spanked? How about doing it in the kitchen or experimenting with props? Do you want blindfolds and restraints involved? Perhaps you like getting bite marks all over the place. If so, by all means ask for it! You might think you are weird or out of the norm for liking the kinky stuff. However, no one is completely normal in bed, which makes you making you quite average. I slept with a guy that loved being choked for gosh sake. Besides, if you want to kick things up a notch or simply want to try something new with your partner, 99 percent of the time your partner will probably be excited and eager to try that something new with you. </p>\n<p>If not for yourself, do it for your partner. You might be enjoying your carnal activities with the hottie with a one-night pass to ride the rollercoaster, but if this is a serious partner we are talking about, you might be putting your relationship at risk. There is nothing worse and more uncomfortable for both of you, than when your partner realizes you are faking it. I have been there, and it is not pretty. Not only will he probably feel hurt and embarrassed, but the trust he had with you will be broken. In the future he might find himself wondering whether he is really pleasing you or if it is all just a ruse, which may put strain on your sex life and your relationship. Being vocal is as good for your partner as it is for you.</p>\n<p>On the topic of relationships, whether he realizes it or not, not getting what you want may make you bored or even resentful in the future. You might lose hope that your partner will ever learn to please you in bed; however, that is something that needs to be addressed in the first place. You may not even notice and, before you know it, the problem will begin affecting both of you. </p>\n<p>Again, he or she may not know that you are not getting what you need, so spare yourself some trouble and regret and speak up about what gets you going before it is too late. I realize it is easy to tell yourself, “I’ll give him this one, next time I’ll tell him the way he sucks on my toes is really not doing it for me for sure.” If you make a habit of “next time” you might never escape the vicious cycle. Am I saying to instruct him on how to do everything? No, but definitely help him get there; you decide the pace you want to take. In the end, both involved parties will be happy and resent-free in no time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I feel a duty to address the young women of my generation and others, because I have listened to many-a-girlfriend’s countless complaints about horrible sex, and it is a complaint that seems to be universal</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now am I saying that guys don’t feel dissatisfied in bed from time to time or that they are all sex robots seeking only to please themselves? Far from it. In the past, I have looked down at my own partner only to realize he is watching me having all the fun with an expression of dissatisfaction, which, of course, I was quick to fix. However, I feel a duty to address the young women of my generation and others, because I have listened to many-a-girlfriend’s countless complaints about horrible sex, and it is a complaint that seems to be universal. We are sometimes taught that as women, being sexual and having preferences is just not acceptable and that we are less “ladylike” if we talk about such “tasteless” subjects. In spite of this mentality, I hope you all realize it is not a crime to respectfully ask for what you want and deny what you do not. </p>\n<p><em>At the end of the day, however, no matter your sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, everyone deserves to enjoy a healthy and pleasurable sex life.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Happn</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happn is an app that gives you matches based on where you go throughout the day. Say you go to Buchanan Hall and pass someone on the way who is also on happn; now they show up in your feed and you have the option to like them. If you match, you start up a conversation. The problem with happn is the lack of users. Most people at UCSB don’t seem to know that happn exists, which doesn’t really make it a useful dating app. In the two or three months I used it, I got a solid four new people in my feed every two weeks. And out of those, only half of them were students from UCSB. The other issue I had with happn was that I found it a little creepy. If you click on somebody, you can see exactly where you crossed paths and how many times. If somebody wanted to stalk me purely from when and where I ran into them on the app, they had a perfect way to do so. Overall, as an app for dating at UCSB, it wasn’t the greatest, because of the lack of UCSB students. As for whether or not it was good for short/long term dating, I really can’t say, just because of the lack of people to test my theories on. </span></p>\n<p><strong>5.

Hinge is made for people looking for more serious connections, so I was hopeful. Unfortunately, most people in the UCSB area, and most people under 22 in general, don’t seem to know about this app, which is kind of a problem, especially if UCSB students under 22 make up your dating pool. Other than that, the app was nicely designed. I appreciated going through one profile at a time. Everybody answered whether or not they drank, smoked (cigarettes and weed), their location, and their schooling. I have a no smokers rule, so with that addition to the profile, it was much easier to filter. But if we’re asking whether or not it’s a good app to find a relationship at UCSB, then it experiences the same problem as happn. There are just not enough people for it to be a viable option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody says that you’ll find your match when you least expect it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Coffee Meets Bagel</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee Meets Bagel is an app that gives you a “bagel” every week, a certain profile of somebody they have picked out for you, somebody they think that you could match with. Again, there weren’t many UCSB students on this app either, but it still had more than Hinge and happn did, which is what puts is further up on the list. The idea of the weekly bagel was cute— while it lasted, anyway. My biggest problem with Coffee Meets Bagel was that, after a certain amount of time in the Santa Barbara area, the app ran out of “bagels” to offer. Aside from students at UCSB, there weren’t even enough other people to fill the “bagel” gap after three or four rejections. At least the app had a discover section where you could potentially create your own matches without the app playing matchmaker. But even with that, the UCSB offerings were slim to none, and I found myself being liked by 34 year olds. Which was kind of creepy. And disgusting. As a whole, the app had a nice concept, but poor follow through and not enough UCSB students to get it higher up on this list. </span></p>\n<p><strong>3. Bumble </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bumble is an app that allows women to message first in order to avoid any inappropriate advances from guys. It’s a very feminist forward idea, but I’ve always wondered what prevents said guys from sending creepy messages after you’ve messaged them first. I do like that it forces you to message each other fairly quickly (the match disappears after twenty four hours unless you make a move) which gets rid of the “I need to wait a week before I message him” Tinder bullshit. I did find myself wishing for more than one day, though. I am a forgetful person. Added to the fact that I don’t always see notifications, I miss some matches entirely. And since the guys have to respond back to me within twenty four hours, I’m sure they experience similar problems. The interface is also quite buggy. It doesn’t always notify you when you have a message, nor does it always load the message when you get the notification. One of the great things about Bumble, though, is the amount of people. Bumble is a fairly well-known app, so UCSB students are not hard to find. And, while it’s not specifically geared toward relationships, because there are so many people, there is a higher likelihood of finding somebody who is looking for the same things you are.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’ve waited long enough, when you just want to feel like you’re doing something to try and find your match, online dating is a good outlet. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. OkCupid </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OkCupid is an app that is definitely for people interested in more serious connections. The app is really well done in that, in addition to photos, each person answers a plethora of questions about themselves and has what they’re looking for on the bottom of their profile: hookups, friends, long term dating. This makes it easier to filter out people who aren’t looking for what you want. One of the frustrating things about this app, though, is that once you have rejected enough people, they start to filter back into your discover feed even though you have already rejected them. It’s like OkCupid is trying to tell you something:”Remember these people you were too good for earlier? Yeah, well, now they’re your only option.” The other extremely annoying feature of the app is that they do not send you notifications when you get a message, they send you emails. So every damn time you get a message, you get an email, which is not great for inbox clutter. It also caused me to miss some messages because I didn’t know I’d gotten them for a long time. There weren’t as many UCSB students as I would’ve wanted, but because there were more students than Hinge, happn, and Coffee Meets Bagel put together, and it was substantially more geared toward relationships, I felt it deserved the number two spot. </span></p>\n<p><strong>1. Tinder </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody knows what Tinder is. Swipe right if you like them, swipe left if you don’t. And if you both like each other, you start up a conversation. Tinder is established. It’s almost never buggy and it’s one of the simplest, easiest apps to navigate and use. Its popularity means that it is, in fact, extremely populated. UCSB students use Tinder.  I’ll be the first to say that I didn’t want Tinder to take the number one spot on this list. It’s definitely not an app that is made for people who are looking for relationships. A lot of the people you message with are just looking to get laid. Despite this drawback (for me, it’s a drawback), there’s one thing about Tinder that none of the other apps can beat: the sheer number of people. Not all of them are looking for relationships, but not all of them are solely interested in hooking up either. Tinder is the only app that can boast this wide a variety of people, which is why, despite the fact that there are better, more relationship geared apps out there, Tinder earns the number one spot on this list. It’s the most versatile app because, if you reject somebody, there will always be somebody else. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I’m being honest, at the end of the day, I don’t really like online dating. It feels impersonal and detached. There is so much about a person that you cannot hope to understand over a phone screen. You don’t know if there would be chemistry, or if you could replicate conversations over text in person. And no app is going to save you when you’re face to face with that person. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But online dating is a good way to be looking. Everybody says that you’ll find your match when you least expect it. It won’t be when you go looking for them. But, when you’ve waited long enough, when you just want to feel like you’re doing something to try and find your match, online dating is a good outlet. It’s a good way to make connections, relationships and test out your moves. It might be impersonal, but that’s also helpful in that you can embarrass yourself without ever meeting that person in real life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships in college, especially at UCSB, can be hard to find. And despite what people say about how you only meet your match when you stop looking, I don’t think I understand how you can expect to find your match if you don’t. So you’re going to match with the wrong people and have bad conversations and go on awful dates, because if you don’t, you’ll never get to the good stuff. Not everybody is looking for what you are, but part of the process is finding out who is.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <em>Komal Surani hopes that her guide can help Gauchos find love right on their mobile device. </em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/","id":6290,"author":{"id":641,"name":"Komal Surani"},"related":[6289,6288,6287],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
