While unincorporated areas such as I.V. and Castro Valley receive municipal services from their county, a CSD is governed by a board of local representatives that decide what services to provide to residents using local tax revenue.</p>\n<p>Traditionally CSD’s are formed through Local Agency Formation Commissions (LAFCO), but both unincorporated areas have found that LAFCO’s model for a CSD does not fit each area’s respective needs. AB 3 bypasses LAFCO by establishing a CSD though state-level legislation. Castro Valley Matters, a group advocating for self-governance in the northern California community, have been closely following the bill, which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law last week.</p>\n<p>According to Castro Valley Matters President Michael Kusiak, the group has followed AB 3 since Williams first introduced the bill to the Assembly in December 2014.</p>\n<p>“We’re kind of crazy people up in northern California who have been following what’s been happening down in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista,” Kusiak said.</p>\n<p>An I.V. CSD as outlined in AB 3 would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Kusiak said a UUT is an “innovative means” of funding self-governance in unincorporated areas, because LAFCO often rejects CSD proposals on the basis that they are not financially feasible.</p>\n<p>“Our contention is that any unincorporated community that tries to go to LAFCO at this point will be told, ‘Actually, no, you’re not fiscally viable,’” Kusiak said. “Isla Vista is really special. It’s really interesting. That’s why we at Castro Valley Matters are following it.”</p>\n<p>Castro Valley Matters Vice President Michael Baldwin said the group is interested in a “virtual town” model, which combines a CSD, a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and an Area Planning Commission (APC). According to Baldwin, no area has attempted this model, but I.V. is “as close as it comes.”</p>\n<p>“I was advocating to have a ‘virtual town’ model, which is basically what you guys did — to have a CSD that covers the whole town,” Baldwin said. “Nobody has ever done all three together — no ‘virtual town’ model.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said the self-governance process in Castro Valley has been “a lot slower” than in I.V., and their few group meetings have led to participants “talking in circles.”</p>\n<p>“It’s the opposite of what’s going on down there,” Baldwin said. “You guys got together and figured something out and pushed it through.”</p>\n<p>Kusiak said AB 3 can serve as an example of local governance for unincorporated areas that are unable to attain cityhood.</p>\n<p>“I think it sets a precedent not just for Castro Valley but for all unincorporated communities,” Kusiak said. “I know it only applies to Isla Vista, but it tells our state legislature that unincorporated communities can be given alternatives.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said when he called William’s office after AB 3 was introduced, staffers told him not to market the bill as a model for other unincorporated areas seeking self-governance for fear it would invite opposition.</p>\n<p>“They kind of said, ‘Oh no. Don’t publish that actually. We don’t want people to think its precedent even though it kind of is,’” Baldwin said. “They were worried that if the legislature saw it as a precedent they might not pass it.”</p>\n<p>Williams said some are “scared to death” AB 3 will pave the way for other areas to circumvent LAFCO when working toward self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you that, with the opposition to AB 3, much of it was based on that it could be precedent setting,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill was specially made for I.V. and he does not intend to replace the LAFCO process throughout California.</p>\n<p>“At no time in this effort have we taken on or criticized the LAFCO process for the entire state,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said Castro Valley Matters’ support demonstrates I.V.’s role as a progressive and innovative unincorporated area.</p>\n<p>“As far as governance for an unincorporated community, it shows that our community is a very forward-thinking one,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said I.V. should support other unincorporated areas such as Castro Valley.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be important for Isla Vista to share its experience now to other communities who need that help,” Abboud said</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 only seeks approval of I.V. residents, not in the recognition of those outside the area.</p>\n<p>“The real legitimacy of the government doesn’t rest with people outside the community,” Williams said. “It rests with the people in the community making the decisions themselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCPD works alongside IVFP to represent the university’s interest in matters of law and safety in I.V. while also patrolling the approximately 1,000 acres of UCSB’s campus, maintaining 24-hour uniformed patrol and police response.</p>\n<p>IVFP Sergeant Daniel Calderon said UCPD officers and IVFP deputies have similar duties and often rotate roles.</p>\n<p>“We all have the same peace officers powers of the state,” Calderon said. “It is just that those officers that are assigned to the campus only work on the campus during that time period. Isla Vista, this particular community, is an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, so [IVFP] handles all of the emergency calls for service.”</p>\n<p>There are currently seven officers from UCPD both patrolling campus and working in I.V. alongside IVFP, according to UCPD Sergeant Robert Romero.</p>\n<p>“That is on a rotational basis, so once every year and a half, two years, an officer will leave the campus patrol station and go work eight months to a year out at Isla Vista,” Romero said. “They are the ones that are really the heart and soul of the department.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP responds to crimes such as burglary, theft, battery and assault, but not traffic accidents, which fall under the California Highway Patrol’s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“We don’t handle the traffic enforcement out here — that is still Highway Patrol — they’re still responsible for handling traffic accident investigations, things like that,” Calderon said. “But we can still pull people over — issue citations for speeding, stop signs we can still make arrests for drunk driving and things like that — it is just that that is not necessarily our primary duty.”</p>\n<p>UCPD’s campus jurisdiction includes lecture halls and university housing in I.V., according to Calderon.</p>\n<p>“All of the buildings that they own that surround Isla Vista, all of the student housing, the faculty housing and [family] student housing, all of the new construction projects that you see — that is all UC property,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD hosts safety presentations for students, especially those living in residence halls, and collaborates with them on solutions to solve public safety issues.</p>\n<p>“We go to different functions that residential life might be putting on,” Romero said. “These interactions we have with students is, basically, we talk to them about things on how to be safe and they talk to us about what they like, what they don’t like from their police department. So it is an exchange of ideas and how to come up with a better plan on how to keep the community safe.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said any student or I.V. resident can join IVFP deputies on a walk-along to experience a day in the life of an officer.</p>\n<p>“From a UCSB student’s perspective, there is just a bunch of cops walking around. Do you know what they are doing?” Calderon said. “That is why I encourage people to do walk-alongs so they can kind of see and point out the problems that we try to tell people about.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, IVFP deputies are trained to use “tactical communication” skills when dealing with “chaotic” scenarios.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say I’m working Del Playa on a Saturday night. It’s really busy and if I went into a party or I went into a fight and people are yelling and it’s a very chaotic, rapidly evolving scene, it is not going to benefit me and it’s not going to benefit my partners if I go in there and start yelling at people,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said newly hired UCPD officers undergo field training alongside an experienced officer.</p>\n<p>“When they get hired they are on a field training program,” Romero said. “Besides learning how to do a proper car stop, how to search somebody properly, how to place somebody into custody, we also teach them how to interact with our community, things to look for, how to be an active listener.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP intervenes when necessary to keep students and I.V. residents safe.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to make sure that everybody enjoys their time here out in Isla Vista and we know that they are away from home and a lot of people are away from home for the first time,” Calderon said. “It is not our greatest goal just to write people tickets for open containers of alcohol.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, deputies prosecute people for wrong-doings to prevent them from repeatedly acting out.</p>\n<p>“We try to prosecute that person because what we found is that when people do that to somebody — when they harm them physically, sexually assault them, that kind of thing — that almost empowers them to where they think that they can do it again and keep doing it in our community,” Calderon said. “That is why we have these people who are repeat offenders.”</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD looks to hire officers who are community oriented.</p>\n<p>“We try to hire people here at the police department that are customer service oriented, community oriented. And when we are doing the hiring process, even some of the interview questions for getting a job here at the police department, we ask them about how do you feel about community-organized policing, can you define it for us, what does it mean to you?” Romero said.</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP seeks to hire “mature” and experienced individuals as deputies.</p>\n<p>“I started this business when I was little bit older, I had already had another career completely. I started this in 2002; I came on board with the Sheriff’s office but I had already done some other things,” Calderon said. “Essentially we want to make sure that the officers and deputies assigned here are mature.”</p>\n<p>Romero said Community Service Organization (CSO) student officers also work alongside UCPD and help with campus security, patrolling campus buildings, sports games and entertainment events.</p>\n<p>“They do a fabulous job of going into the community, because their peers are the students,” Romero said. “They also are an extra pair of eyes and ears for any trouble that is going on in the university campus or Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Romero said the number of officers at the UCPD station, which includes an investigation unit and dispatch center, will likely soon increase.</p>\n<p>“Currently we have 36 sworn police officers, however, that number is going to grow probably another 10 here in the near future,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Mable Truong said she did not know the difference between IVFP and UCPD, and previously was not aware of the CSO program.</p>\n<p>“I would be one of the people that are confused,” Truong said. “I think I have an idea of what they do — they are the people that bring you around at night … then I just saw them last night so I thought that was really cool, and they seem really friendly, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Elizabeth Del Rincon said she feels safer on campus and in I.V. with a visible police presence.</p>\n<p>“Just if something bad were to happen, I feel like they would be there to go and help,” Del Rincon said.</p>\n<p>Del Rincon said she believes it is important for officers to receive training on how to work with students.</p>\n<p>“They are around students all the time so I feel like if they were to receive training it would be better,” Del Rincon said. “I see them especially at night escorting people to their dorms and stuff and I think that is really good.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Jill Allen said the CSO escort program is helpful and allows students to feel safer.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel safer trying to walk from one end, especially to walk from the Chem building to I.V. in the dark. It’s not so fun,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, UCPD and IVFP work together without overstepping boundaries.</p>\n<p>“It is two different jurisdictions, but in other words, we work very closely. We don’t step on each other’s toes,” Calderon said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/","id":4629,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4628,4627,4626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Doreen Farr Talks to Community About I.V.

Self-Governance Bill (AB 3), which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law on Wednesday, and funding for and I.V. Community Center. AB 3 aims to make I.V. a Community Services District (CSD) governed by a board of local representatives and supported by a Utility Users Tax (UUT).</p>\n<p>Farr said it will be a “big job” to educate I.V. residents about how a CSD would affect them before they vote to approve it in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes people get voter fatigue; they’ve got this enormous ballot, all this stuff to go through so hopefully [AB 3] doesn’t get lost in that,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr said she has heard concerns regarding funding for CSD administrative costs and services, and the role Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) would play in a CSD.</p>\n<p>Farr said a UUT, which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills, is a more effective method of dividing the costs of the CSD between students, long-time residents and property owners.</p>\n<p>“That was why they wanted the UUT rather than a property tax because the thought was that the tax burden is spread more evenly throughout the community that benefits, and not just on those people that own property,” said Farr. “Long-term owners are concerned that they are going to be saddled with enormous tax assessments.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, IVRPD was intentionally excluded from the CSD planning.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. Park and Rec District did not want to be folded into the CSD and that was why we thought the governor might not sign it, because he doesn’t like creating layers,” Farr said. “So it was specifically written to exclude IVRPD … we’ve got a good thing going, we don’t want to goof it up.”</p>\n<p>Professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said he has plans to raise funds for an Isla Vista Community Center that involve alumni and current students.</p>\n<p>“There are 190,000 alumni at UCSB and most of them have probably lived in Isla Vista,” Ebenstein said. “Only 15,000 people live here at a time, but over twenty or thirty years, 150,000 may have lived here.”</p>\n<p>According to Ebenstein, significant funds are still needed to build a community center.</p>\n<p>“$483,000 is a start, but it is not enough to do everything that should be done,” Ebenstein said. “Our goal would be to raise a million dollars … What we are trying to do is raise a million dollars more — that would be the funds that we think would be necessary to really make the community center.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

California in the coming months, bringing wet weather and the possibility of increased erosion along the cliffs of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>El Niño is a climatic change that occurs every two to seven years near the equatorial Pacific region. The 2015 El Niño has already affected climate patterns and ocean temperatures in the Pacific region. While winter weather across the country will feel the effects of El Niño, California and other Southern states in particular will experience atypical weather conditions and heavy rain.</p>\n<p>Associate professor of earth sciences Alex Simms said the predicted heavy precipitation may lead to increased erosion.</p>\n<p>“There are higher rates of erosion during El Niño,” Simms said. “If you have one of those houses that is already hanging off the cliff, things are probably going to get bad for you.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor of geology Charles Jones said El Niño is caused by a change in atmosphere that leads to warming waters and heavier moisture.</p>\n<p>“An El Niño is an interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially the tropical oceans,” Jones said. “It has a reoccurrence time of about two to seven years and it has a lot of natural variability.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the upcoming El Niño is predicted to be the strongest in nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>“Some forecasters think that it might be similar to the ’97, ’98 El Niño, which was the strongest El Niño on record,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and I.V. resident Molly Morrison, who last year led a campaign to install safety fences along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive, said she is concerned heavy rains may cause damage to the cliffs.</p>\n<p>“I’m not so concerned about the fences as I am about the actual cliff situation,” Morrison said. “Whether the fences can stand or not I don’t think is really the question, but whether the cliffs can.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said even without increased precipitation levels the cliffs are subject to significant erosion each year.</p>\n<p>“On average, the cliffs on this side of Isla Vista are supposed to erode about a foot a year,” Morrison said. “It will be interesting to see, if El Niño does pick up, in winds, velocity … how it will increase cliff erosion rates.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major Connor Dodds said though he lives in a cliffside house on Del Playa, he is not concerned about El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be any big deal,” Dodds said. “When it’s high tide, the waves have already been hitting the cliff and it hasn’t really been doing much.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and Spanish double major Connor Kulg, Dodds’ housemate, said he looks forward to the improved surf that will come with El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I’m not too worried,” Kulg said. “I’m not looking forward to the rains, but I am looking forward to the big waves.”</p>\n<p>Simms said the cliffs have been eroding for many years, and will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>“This process has been going on for thousands of years, and there is nothing we can do to stop it,” Simms said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
