She’s registered over 800 wins, has been with the women’s program since it started and has done color commentary for ESPN. Her nickname is “The Queen,” for God’s sake. Basically, she’s far too qualified to teach me how to play this sport. So far, she’s given me the biggest physical challenge of the three coaches. Those backline-to-net shuffles are killers. But she’s also the loudest, funniest and most charismatic teacher so far. She jokingly yelled at a kid the other day and he looked like he was going to cry. Awesome. Plus volleyball is made for tall people, and I’m tall. No worries here.</p>\n<p><strong>Mircea Badulescu – Elementary Soccer</strong></p>\n<p>A childhood full of golf gave me hand-eye coordination. Foot-eye, not so much. I am also not much of a runner despite my gazelle strides, nor am I very agile. On top of that, this class consists of nothing but playing soccer. No drills, no pointers, just the game. Badulescu seems cool enough, but I don’t anticipate much interaction because he observes rather than teaches. That being said, he has a cool accent, which is a big plus. The wildcard in the bunch, to say the least.</p>\n<p><strong>Charlotte Scatliffe – Intermediate Tennis</strong></p>\n<p>The first ESS class I took at UCSB was beginning tennis. I had no prior skills, but that class was such a fun experience that I decided to take another. Plus, probably due to the hand-eye coordination thing, I had a little bit of a knack for it. That being said, tennis is hard. There’s a lot of stopping and starting again and turning and starting involved. Don’t even get me started on the serves. Scatliffe is the current assistant coach for women’s tennis, and was a player herself from 2004 to 2008. She has youth on her side, which is good in a teacher. We play fun games, she’s already developed a rapport with some kids and is very personable. Spunky, even. But … tennis is hard, man.</p>\n<p>So that’s the rundown. One week in, and I like to think I already feel a little better. Eating ice cream for dinner and downing my fair share of pitchers at Gio’s can’t be helping, but I’m committed to this. I promise to share with you my emotional and physical journey upon which I venture to exchange my man flab for a six pack. Or maybe I’ll just stick with the six-pack of Blue Moons in my fridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

<em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Two professors from McGill University and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies gave keynote lectures at the Mosher Alumni House to celebrate the opening of the Confucius Institute on campus yesterday.</p>\n<p>The first lecture, “Globalizing Regions: the Spread of Southeast Chinese Daoist Ritual Traditions to Southeast Asia,” was given by East Asian Studies Professor Kenneth Dean of McGill University. Immediately following Dean, Professor of Trade &amp; Economic Diplomacy at the Middlebury Institute and Institute for Trade and Commercial Diplomacy President Robert Rogowsky gave a lecture entitled, “U.S.-China Trade Policy: Productive Collaboration or Managed Rivalry?” Religious studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang began the meeting by giving a summary about what the opening of the Confucius Institute means for the university.</p>\n<p>“We will emphasis academics and research more than most Confucius institutes,” Yang said, “We still will be in the business of educating the public, promoting China studies, strengthening understanding of Chinese history, culture, society, religion, philosophy, literature, economics, and politics.”</p>\n<p>During the lecture Dean discussed the background of Southeast Asia’s cultural history presented his findings from his long-term ethnographic studies focused on Southeast China. According to Dean, ethnic communities with distinct dialects provide cultural benefits to its surrounding region.</p>\n<p>“The dialect communities provide a lot of strength and resources for communities,” Dean said.</p>\n<p>Afterward Rogowsky gave a lecture on the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, highlighting economic issues brought about by China’s rapid industrialization.</p>\n<p>“The growth of the middle class in China and in particular Asia is huge,” Rogowsky said. “It’s good but is also somewhat problematic. Problematic in the sense that people in the middle class eat a lot more than people who are poor … so it increases the demand for food tremendously.”</p>\n<p>Vice Director of Confucius Institute Professor Lijuan Zhang ended the meeting with closing statements about the opening of the Confucius Institute and the value of its research.</p>\n<p>“[There is] lots of debate on Chinese issues but there is one consensus that I think everyone would agree,” Zhang said, “that it’s worth the research about China.”</p>\n<p>Second-year religious studies graduate student Sarah Veeck said she was interested in Dean’s analysis on the changes in the Putian plain over the last hundred years.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of depth. There also with the transnational connections continuing to impact local religion in China,” Veeck said. “I would be interested in dong long-term ethnographic study on a community that does rely on local temple associations to provide assistance for education, infrastructure projects, funerals for people who can’t afford them.”</p>\n<p>Yang said Dean offered a historical perspective of Fujian that maintained a locally-oriented account of its regional impact throughout Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>“Professor Rogowsky’s talk had a very powerful global perspective that really serves the global studies academic community here on campus,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the two keynote speeches illustrated the Confucius Institute’s as well as China’s “globally important” role on campus and in the world.</p>\n<p>“It’s a dynamically changing society.” Yang said. “All these global transnational problems, you need China on board. You need to engage with China. Just because you don’t agree on a few things doesn’t mean you cannot include China because China is a dynamic society. It can help the rest of the world a great deal.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60644\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of engr.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>Chemical engineering professor Samir Mitragotri was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) last week, a professional distinction that honors individuals who have made outstanding contributions to engineering research, practice or education.</p>\n<p>One of 67 newly elected members this year and the only faculty member from UCSB, Mitragotri was honored for his work with transdermal drug delivery systems done in part with the Mitragotri group, which he runs in the department of Chemical Engineering. The distinction joins his other honors of being elected to the National Academy of Inventors in 2013 and as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012.</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he won academy membership because of the advancements he and his research group made in treating patients through medicinal patches on the skin instead of injection with needles.</p>\n<p>“[NAE membership is] really a sort of validation and a culmination of the value of the work that we have been doing,” Mitragotri said. “It’s an encouragement to continue on the same path.”</p>\n<p>According to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Mitragotri is well-deserving of the prestigious election.</p>\n<p>“Election to the Academy by one’s peers is one of the highest recognitions for an engineer, an acknowledgment of outstanding and pioneering research,” Yang said. “This distinction joins a long list of Samir’s other well-deserved honors and accomplishments.”</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he believes a large part of his recognition is due to the students and research group members who work with him.</p>\n<p>“I really want to thank my students and my research group,” Mitragotri said. “They are the ones who do the hard work on a day-to-day basis, and the work that is recognized is really their doing.”</p>\n<p>With his membership, Mitragotri said he looks forward to conferring with other engineers on making decisions for the future of the engineering field.</p>\n<p>“It’s really an opportunity to participate in the future discussions of engineering at the national level,” Mitragotri said, “That could really be the key benefit and the key outcome of this election.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemical engineering major Zach Sawaya said Mitragotri’s election is unsurprising, given the reputation of the university’s engineering programs.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest, but it makes me very excited,” Sawaya said. “This appointment is simply an indication of the excellent faculty and students … and a reason we have one of the top chemical engineering departments in the country.”</p>\n<p>“Really, it’s representative of UCSB science as a whole,” Sawaya said. “We are a top science university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/national-academy-of-engineering-awards-ucsb-prof-membership/","id":2907,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2906,2905,2904],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
