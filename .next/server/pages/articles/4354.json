Then in the third inning junior outfielder Hunter Mercado-Hood hit a sac fly to the deep right and tied the game at one.</p>\n<p>The Toreros then enjoyed a brief 2-1 lead after the top of the fourth as they added one run. The Gauchos responded with a three-run frame that was led by freshman outfielder Michael McAdoo hitting a fielder’s choice that batted one runner in and an error on the play led to another runner scoring. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark hit an RBI single and made the score 4-2 after four full frames.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its hot hitting in the fifth after another three-run bottom frame that seemingly put San Diego away as it could not answer back to that extent. UCSB sealed the championship victory after adding two more runs, compared to SD’s one run, and winning by a final score of 9-3.</p>\n<p>Designated hitter Austin Bush led the team going 3-3 in the championship round adding three runs scored as well. The sophomore was also honored with tournament MVP after a 7-11 weekend which included six RBI and one homer.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore Joe Record also continued his strong start to the season picking up his second win after going 6 1/3 innings deep allowing four hits and two earned runs.</p>\n<p>However, before the Gauchos had the opportunity to take home some nice hardware they first had to defeat previously undefeated Bryant University. They were able to punch their ticket to the championship game and hand the Bulldogs their first loss of the season after their best offensive showing of the year scoring 16 runs on 14 hits.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, Bryant started the scoring in the top of the third adding one run courtesy of junior Matt Albanese, however, it missed out on a great opportunity blowing a bases loaded scenario with only one out in the inning. It was Clark who made a diving catch when the ball was hit his way and turned it into a 5-4-3 double play.</p>\n<p>The senior then continued to help his team hitting his first home-run of the season and tying the game up at one. The Gauchos added three more runs to take a 4-1 lead after three innings of play.</p>\n<p>The game was still somewhat close as the score was 6-2 headed into the seventh inning when UCSB scored seven runs in that frame to put away Bryant. It continued to show its dominance adding three more runs in the final two innings to win the game by an impressive 16-2 score.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore J.J Muno continued his hot start to the season going 2-3 with two RBI. He was helped by Grover who went a perfect 3-3 and also had two RBI. Although the Gauchos had great hitting they were also helped by the Bulldogs eight walks and hitting six additional batters that attributed four runs.</p>\n<p>Pitching was also great as Freshman Noah Davis picked up his first win of the season after five strong innings allowing six hits and two runs while also adding four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Before the Gauchos best offensive output of the season, they had a strong start to the tournament against No. 22 Kentucky. UCSB scored 11 runs on 14 hits and had another strong performance from Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>The junior right-handed pitcher was amazing at one point not allowing a single run until the seventh inning. Bieber then ran out of gas as he was ultimately pulled one out into the sixth inning after allowing three singles. He still picked up the win putting his record at a perfect 2-0.</p>\n<p>Bieber was also helped tremendously by yet another dominant performance by the Gaucho hitters. Five UCSB hitters got extra base hits including Bush’s 430-foot homerun in the top of the seventh inning. The future tournament MVP started his weekend strong going 3-5 and having two RBI.</p>\n<p>The scoring started early for Santa Barbara as it took a 3-0 lead after three runs in the second inning thanks to McAdoo’s RBI single, sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI groundout and Clark’s RBI single. Clark picked up another RBI in the fourth inning after a solid single down the left field line making the score 4-0.</p>\n<p>As Kentucky was unable to score, the Gauchos decided to take advantage scoring four more runs in the fifth inning to take a commanding 8-0 lead. UCSB led 10-0 after the top of the seventh thanks to Bush’s aforementioned HR and Clark’s third RBI of the day.</p>\n<p>Although Kentucky made a strong push in the bottom of the seventh frame scoring three runs, the deficit was too much to overcome and it lost to Santa Barbara 11-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB saw great performances from mostly every player that took part in the game whether it be on the mound or on the plate. All its starters collected at least one hit and only one did not score a run. It was a dominant performance all around yet then again so was the whole tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did a great job of bouncing back after its first loss of the season. Instead of sulking they went out and outscored their three weekend opponents by a score of 36-9. Many, if not all, players had great tournament performances highlighted by Bush’s MVP and Clarks All-Tournament Honoree play.</p>\n<p>This confidence-boosting weekend could not have come at a better time as now UCSB must turn its sights to one of their toughest opponents on its schedule this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Tuesday, March 1<sup>st</sup> against No. 21 UCLA at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

collaboration with the many organizations that currently provide different aspects of the dispute resolution process, including the Isla Vista Tenants Union, UC Santa Barbara’s Community Housing Office and others in the area.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (CSD) has not yet decided the program’s specifics but board members have called its creation a “top priority.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB3\">Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3)</a>, which paved the way for the I.V. CSD’s creation with its passage in 2015, provided the district the power to create a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand gave a presentation about similar tenant mediation programs during the CSD’s Tuesday meeting and said I.V. residents have reached out for assistance with tenant-landlord mediation in the past.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents contacted the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program for help 64 times in the 2014 to 2015 fiscal year. This is the highest usage rate of by an unincorporated area of the county and nearly double the rate of the community with the second highest usage, according to the presentation.</p>\n<p>Tenants reached out to the mediation program mostly for security deposit refunds, lease terminations, habitability and repair issues and rent increase disputes.</p>\n<p>IVTU provides education and advocacy for tenants and some case work for rental housing issues and the UCSB Community Housing Office provides some dispute resolution and mediation.</p>\n<p>The Legal Aid Foundation of Santa Barbara County also provides information about tenants’ rights and responsibilities, but there is yet to be a service that unites all areas of tenant-landlord issues for all residents.</p>\n<p>Bertrand compared mediation programs in the cities of Palo Alto and Santa Barbara to I.V., which he said has a need for a similar program considering the size of the population and its requests for help from tenant organizations.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Tuesday’s discussion was the board of directors’ first time discussing tenant-landlord mediation programs and said he hopes to discuss the program’s creation with other I.V. stakeholders as the board moves forward.</p>\n<p>If the CSD chooses, it can make its mediation program mandatory through an ordinance, though a majority of board members have said they would first like to create a successful voluntary program before mandating mediation for disputes.</p>\n<p>He said some tenant mediation programs passed by local governments have included provisions for mandatory mediation programs but believes public input is necessary before the CSD makes any program mandatory.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to learning more about the community’s desire for a tenant mediation program and ordinance … The purpose of last night’s presentation was to show examples of what other communities have done to bolster tenant protections,” Bertrand said in an email.</p>\n<p>Some board members have come out in favor of a mandatory tenant mediation program but also say the program must acquire funding and become effective before it can ever become mandatory.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board member Bob Geis said the district should fund the program through the user utility tax that the board is working to bring to the voters by next year.</p>\n<p>Board members are still debating the exact percentage of the tax that will go on next year’s ballot. The utility tax fell short of the 66 percent vote it needed last year, with 61.22 percent of the vote, when Measure F asked voters for an 8 percent tax on Nov. 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD board member and secretary, said a mediation program could create a difference in the way that landlords treat tenants.</p>\n<p>“Customer service to their tenants is not something that is prioritized or even needed because our rental housing market is just so — there’s no choice … There’s no places you can go if you don’t like your landlord,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said a mandatory program similar to the city of Palo Alto’s could make landlords more responsive when it comes to repairs, security deposit issues and resolving other disputes.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

During a goat yoga class, goats interact with participants by jumping on participants’ backs or snuggling on the yoga mat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goat yoga class in I.V. will be held at the Santa Barbara Hillel this upcoming Saturday, Dec. 2, at 11 a.m. A maximum of 50 people are allowed in the class, and the class will cost $40 per participant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Bahar, a second-year undeclared major and host of the event, said goat yoga is more beneficial than regular yoga because the interaction with goats releases endorphins, which stimulates a positive feeling in the body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It connects you to the people around you and provides a friendly atmosphere,” Bahar said. “It is more than zen and more of an experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar grew up in Los Angeles and said he discovered goat yoga last August. He was on a waitlist for three months before he could participate because there is only one studio in Los Angeles that offers the unique yoga class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an amazing experience and a crazy wild adrenaline rush. You are just surrounded by people having a good time,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar said he wanted to bring goat yoga to I.V. because UCSB students “stress out and don’t find time for themselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar contacted a farm in Sun Valley, Calif. that brings certified goats to yoga events. It is “fairly expensive” to bring this experience to Isla Vista, Bahar said, but he expects a good turnout at the class.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga was created by Lainey Morse, a goat owner from Albany, Oreg. Morse was encouraged by a local yoga instructor to connect her love of goats with the practice of yoga. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga is animal-assisted therapy, according to Morse’s </span><a href=\"https://goatyoga.net/about/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and is an “unbelievable distraction” from work, politics or sickness.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not Bahar’s first time helping students destress before finals. He also started a business called Party Ice which delivers ice cream sandwiches to residents in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall the week before midterms and finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Goat yoga is a step above Party Ice and is still a way to help people destress,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those interested in signing up for goat yoga can email Bahar at </span><em><a href=\"mailto:ivgoatyoga@gmail.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivgoatyoga@gmail.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/","id":4353,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[4352,4351,4350],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
