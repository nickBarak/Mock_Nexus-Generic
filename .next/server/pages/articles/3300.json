Wade was a +1600 underdog. Meaning, had Wade won and someone placed a hundred dollar bet on him, those that gambled on the 26 year old would have received a $1600 payout according to <em>ESPN.com</em>.</p>\n<p>However, the game of odds did not hold much significance in Saturday’s bout once the bell rung and the referee gave the signal for the clash to begin as Golovkin established his lopsided dominance from its very beginning.</p>\n<p>Wade, in his neon green Everlast gloves, attempted to establish the jab early against a fairly static Golovkin. In typical Triple G fashion, Gennady walked down his opponent and did not show much head movement in the early parts of the round, but Wade was unable to capitalize on Golovkin’s lax defense.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the round, Golovkin, a Kazakhstan native, landed a solid overhand right and dropped Wade for the first time with only ten seconds remaining in the opening round, marking the beginning of the end for the young American middleweight.</p>\n<p>Despite getting knocked down in the first, Wade seemed to have gotten himself back together as he entered the second round connecting with a flurry of punches, but Golovkin regained his composure showing some solid defense and continued to seek his opponent.</p>\n<p>Triple G took the punishment but seemed unmoved and responded a few moments later with a three punch combination that would drop Wade for a second time. The jab, uppercut and cross all landed with fervor and it might have been the end right there, but Dominic showed the heart of a champion by getting up and began exchanging once again. Regardless of the heart Dominic displayed, Gennady Golovkin wrapped up the night by delivering an unforgiving right hand on the button. With all that it was over.</p>\n<p>As Triple G added another consecutive knockout as well as another successful title defense to his already impressive resume, there was a question looming over everyone’s head: Will Saul “Canelo” Alvarez be the next opponent?</p>\n<p>For the sake of boxing, we hope so.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned in my colleague Sean White’s “Rebirth of The Ringside, Thurman Vs. Porter,” the sport of boxing is due for a major facelift. As the career of Manny Pacquiao nears its ending following the retirement of Floyd Mayweather Jr., the boxing industry is in need of a new ‘poster boy.’</p>\n<p>However, what my fellow counterpart has failed to mention is that the sport of boxing does not need to be revived; it has and always will continue to thrive. Perhaps to the casual boxing fan there are not enough stars in the sport to attract them to drop hard-earned cash to watch a hard-fought fight.</p>\n<p>Certainly, UFC and MMA has been a hot commodity over the past years, garnering the attention of many. But the truth of the matter is that both fighting organizations still have a long way to go. With regard to the vulnerability of all fighters in both MMA and boxing, it’s difficult to surpass the reality that the elite fighters of the UFC and MMA still make just a fraction of the pay day’s top prize fighters in boxing currently make.</p>\n<p>A fair question would be, why is it that there is such a disparity between combat athletes? I would propose to take a look at the popularity of the sports as a primary indicator as to how much each sport can afford to pay its athletes.</p>\n<p>The more paying viewers open to patronize the sport, the more the promotion has in profit, which in turn can find its way to compensate the fighters.</p>\n<p>According to a survey conducted on the discrepancy between the two combat sports posted on <em>sherdog.com</em>, the global authority on mixed martial arts, MMA has less avid fans than boxing.</p>\n<p>The amount of boxing fans weigh in at totals of 12,698,000, while the MMA fan base is at 12,219,000. Aside from the sheer numbers, it is when the demographics get broken down that there is a clearer understanding as to why one sport makes more money than the other.</p>\n<p>MMA has more viewers in the 18-29 age group than boxing. A total of 1,133,000 in that demographic have reported that they would prefer to watch Mixed Martial Arts. According to the same study on the other hand, the older age groups consisting of 30-44 and 45-64 would rather watch boxing. That is 853,000 more people with more money to spend.</p>\n<p>Even though the future is looking good for MMA, currently the demographic with the most disposable income would prefer to spend their cash on good ol’ fashion pugilism.</p>\n<p>Despite all the numbers, statistics, PPV buys and more, most people get stuck in a mindset of the polarity. For most people it is either or, but one thing is for sure. There is definitely enough room for the both of them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/unanimous-decision-boxing-reigns-supreme/","id":3300,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[3299,3298,3297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas","biography":"Not available","articles":[82,83,84,89,97,99,100,102,104,112,117,118,119,1014,1048,1051,1052,1074,1085,1087,1090,1105,1108,1109,3300],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"2016 NBA Playoffs: Eastern Conference Locked In","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/east.png?resize=221%2C228&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/east.png?resize=221%2C228&ssl=1","description":"With the 2016 NBA Playoffs set to tip-off this morning, each Staff Writer explains their take on the Eastern Conference matchups in store.

He is averaging 28.4 points, eight rebounds and 8.5 assists over his last 10 games, and he’s shooting 63% from the field and 52% from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Forward Kevin Love and point guard Kyrie Erving provide plenty of additional scoring power, while Tristan Thompson, Timofey Mozgov and Channing Frye will crash the boards and play solid defense down low.</p>\n<p>The Detroit Pistons come into the series with a record of 44-38 this year, and will be in the playoffs for the first time in seven years. Though they are considered heavy underdogs to the Cavaliers, they won three of their four games played against the Cavs during the regular season, including the Pistons 112-110 overtime victory in the last game of the regular season on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The Pistons’ greatest strength this year has been their offensive rebounding as they have the second best percentage in the League. Pistons’ center Andre Drummond dominates the offensive glass and his presence down low will be a key matchup with the Cavs’ rebounding trio of LeBron, Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson.  Also Pistons’ guard Reggie Jackson is the team’s leading scorer, and has proven to be a dangerous threat when he and Drummond team up on pick and rolls.</p>\n<p>With both Drummond and Jackson on the floor together, the Pistons will find points under the basket which allows the defense to collapse, giving more opportunities for 6’9” forward Tobias Harris and other Detroit shooters to hit from the outside. Harris was acquired by the Pistons at the trading deadline, and had been an outstanding fit. He has averaged 16.6 points and 38% shooting from behind the three point line in 27 games with the Pistons.</p>\n<p>However, the Pistons’ will have a hard time slowing down the Cavaliers’ explosive offense.  LeBron James is a future Hall of Famer who will no doubt raise his game and those of his teammates in this Detroit series.  The Cavaliers are hungry to make it back to the NBA Finals, and now that they are healthy, I expect them to take this series in five games.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Toronto Raptors vs. Indiana Pacers (7) – Ryan Burns </strong></p>\n<p>As second-seed Toronto (56-26) prepares for its first round matchup with the seventh-seeded Indiana Pacers (45-37), the spotlight will be on the pairing of point guard Kyle Lowry and shooting guard Demar DeRozan, who have blossomed into one of the league’s premier backcourt combos in the last couple seasons.</p>\n<p>Lowry and DeRozan averaged an impressive 21.2 and 23.5 ppg, respectively, in the regular season, one of only three backcourts to average over 20 apiece, along with the Golden State’s Steph Curry/Klay Thompson and Portland’s Damian Lillard/CJ McCollum.</p>\n<p>The pair has carried much of the scoring load for the Raptors all year, and Lowry and DeRozan’s explosive playstyle earned both of the guards All-Star appearances en route to the second seed in the East, emerging as the top contender to replace the Cavs as the conference’s representation in the Finals.</p>\n<p>An unsung hero of Toronto’s successful season has been rookie Norman Powell, who could be a key factor in the first round after tallying 27 and 30 points in two of the Raptor’s last four games, making a claim for increased playing time in April.</p>\n<p>If the Pacers are to stop Toronto from advancing past the first round for the first time since 2001, the charge will likely be led by All-Star small forward Paul George. He has been Indiana’s best player all year, averaging 23.1 points/game and 7.0 rebounds/game.</p>\n<p>George is also experienced in the playoffs, and even though his team missed the postseason last year, he led the Pacers to the Eastern Conference Finals the two previous seasons.</p>\n<p>If the regular season is any indicator, the Raptors will have the edge against their opponents, as they recorded a solid 3-1 record over the Pacers this year, including a convincing 111-98 victory in the last week of the season.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Miami Heat vs. Boston Celtics (6) – Xavier Cardenas </strong></p>\n<p>The month of April, for many it marks the beginning of spring, new flowers, plenty of greens, and warm clothing. For me, it marks the beginning of the NBA playoffs with new champions to be crowned, new stories to be told, and a new sense of hope for cities all across the country. As is the case for the No. 3 Miami Heat and No. 6 Charlotte Hornets.</p>\n<p>The Miami Heat, led by veteran Dwayne Wade, have finished the season 48-34 despite losing a key contributor in forward Chris Bosh the Heat have finished as a team to beat in the east. Chris Bosh has not played since February and is not expected to be back due to blood clots.</p>\n<p>However, the rest of the Miami roster have been able to pick up the slack landing fifth in the league for opponents points per game and thirteenth for rebounds per game. Also in the month of March the Heat have averaged 110 ppg that is a 16.3% improvement from the month of January and a 8.7% improvement from February.</p>\n<p>Aside from the household names, rookie standouts have upped production as of late. Second round draft pick Josh Richardson has officially been recognized as the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for his contributions in March with the Heat.</p>\n<p>The rookie guard had spent a lot of time on the bench as well as time in the NBA D-League earlier in the 2015-2016 season.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 2016 campaign both teams have had a similar season, Miami and Charlotte ended their season with the same record and similar statistics in the wins and losses column.</p>\n<p>The regular season encounters could not separate them either as it ended 2-2 with an away and home win each. This will be one of the tighter series of the first round of the playoffs. By no means is this going to be an easy series for either team.</p>\n<p>The Hornets are 11th in the league for points per game, 14th in rebounds, and ninth in opponents points per game.</p>\n<p>Both teams have displayed a defensive tenacity appropriate for the top ten defenses and great perimeter defense demonstrated this season. However, the Hornets have been hard to keep from scoring as of late. Charlotte has the 11th best offense in the league averaging 103 ppg and is seventh in three-point percentage shooting at 36.2 percent.</p>\n<p>Kemba Walker has led the Hornets with his production and it will have to continue if he hopes to get to the second round. The former ninth overall pick of the 2011 NBA draft has led Charlotte in several categories.</p>\n<p>The young guard leads with 20.9 ppg and 1.6 steals per game. Against the Heat, Walker is averaging 19.5 ppg, 2.3 steals per game, 5.3 rebounds per game, and 5.3 assists per game.</p>\n<p>This series promises to be a good one as not much separates the two. I am a believer that history repeats itself and the last time the Hornets made the playoffs they were swept by the Heat in 2014.</p>\n<p>Now I do believe the Heat will move on to the second round but not in the same fashion. Miami wins in seven against a tough, young, and improving Hornets franchise.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Atlanta Hawks vs. Boston Celtics (5) – Daniel Moebus-Bowles </strong></p>\n<p>The matchup between the Celtics and Hawks could be the closest series on the Eastern end of the playoff bracket as both teams head into the postseason with an identical record of 48-34. Winning three of the four head-to-head matchups Atlanta takes home court advantage and has topped Boston in the last three meetings, including a 118-107 win just last week.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to look at these two teams as they have very many similarities such as great defense and phenomenal coaching. Each team has a great system that’s run by a roster full of talent and role players that will ultimately decide the outcome of the series. Although the Celtics are a very hot team this year with a fast pace style that is fun to watch, it will be the Hawks that will have the edge in this first round as their group of guys have much more playoff experience after last year’s deep run.</p>\n<p>Isaiah Thomas did a fantastic job this year of lighting a fire in The Garden again and recreating this team that only made the 2015 playoffs with a sub .500 record thanks to the then lackluster Eastern Conference. He is the All-Star that will lead his team, but it will be up to roles that Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley take to continue knowing their job on the court every night.</p>\n<p>Bradley tops Thomas in minutes per game with 33.4 and Crowder is less than a minute below Thomas at 31.6. The two also are 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> on the team in scoring. For Boston to defeat Atlanta, they will need Bradley and Crowder to continue spreading the floor to allow Thomas to play his game and be ready to ready to execute when the little guy looks to dish the ball as he does so well.</p>\n<p>Atlanta will not only have the advantage with the playoff experience and the momentum of winning 14 of their last 20 games, but they also have the series’ two best players in veterans Paul Millsap and Al Horford. Besides a slight hit to their efficiency in offense and the loss of DeMarre Carroll, this is still the same team that we saw win 60 games last season. After being swept 4-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals, this team is hungry for another deep run and have a deep roster to help them get there.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Atlanta in four</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-16/2016-nba-playoffs-eastern-conference-matchups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-16/2016-nba-playoffs-eastern-conference-matchups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-16/2016-nba-playoffs-eastern-conference-matchups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-16/2016-nba-playoffs-eastern-conference-matchups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-16/2016-nba-playoffs-eastern-conference-matchups/","id":3297,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[3296,3295,3294],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rebirth Of The Ringside, Thurman vs. Porter","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-4-20.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-4-20.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After having their initial March 12 meeting postponed, Keith Thurman and Shawn Porter are set to go toe-to-toe on June 25 at the Barclays Center.

Emily Zhang /Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The fight had an initial date set for March 12 that had to be postponed due to Thurman suffering whiplash in a car accident. It will be the third title defense for the reigning champion and the first fight in the year 2016 for both fighters.</p>\n<p>Via <em>Boxrec.com</em>, the best of the best are set to step foot in the ring, with Thurman rated as the No. 1 boxer in the USA and No. 2 in the world. Porter is just one spot behind Thurman at No. 2 in the USA rankings and No. 5 in the world.</p>\n<p>Similar to their closeness in ratings, the tale of the tape displays a near identical resemblance between the two as both differ by just half an inch in height and reach.</p>\n<p>Yet separating the pair of boxers is the one loss on Porter’s record. At 26-1-1, Porter has the opportunity to put an end to Thurman’s undefeated 26-0-0 record.</p>\n<p>While the legendary hard-nosed, toe-to-toe boxing matches from decades past are no longer as pertinent as they once were, the possibility of either boxer falling to the canvas is certainly ideal.</p>\n<p>More likely to deliver this knockdown blow is Thurman, also known as ‘One Time’ for his punishing hits. A total of 81 percent of his victories have been earned by knockout.</p>\n<p>Most notably, just four of his career 26 fights have been decided by a unanimous decision, while his other 22 wins have all been decided by knockout.</p>\n<p>Although Porter has achieved just 57 percent of his wins by knockout, he is more of a strategic fighter who looks to break his opponents down over the duration of rounds as he seeks that finishing head or body shot.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, a unique technique within Porter’s finishing realm of punches is this lunging hook/haymaker that he commonly throws when in search of causing real damage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wybyegEKS78?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A similar calculated, disciplined approach can be identified in Thurman as well, but it is his more aggressive approach which has allowed him to become the knockout artist he has proven himself to be. It is evident that Thurman isn’t afraid to gamble at times and make himself appear vulnerable while hunting for that power punch to end a fight.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRSap9PsVOU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>While it is too early to decide on a definite corner to support, my mind is telling me to side with Thurman and the entertainment factor he presents while my heart believes in the hunger of Porter, who has not hoisted a championship belt since enduring his first loss to Kell Brook in defense of his IBF World Welterweight Title back on Aug. 16, 2014.</p>\n<p>A decision on who to side with may never appear, but the anticipation for the June 25 bout shall continue to surmount, as it has the potential to be one of the best fights in years to come as professional boxing transitions from one star to another.</p>\n<p><em>All stats according to Boxrec.com.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/rebirth-of-the-ringside-thurman-vs-porter/","id":3298,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3297,3296,3295],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Return: 2015-16 NBA Season Close-Up","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/basketball-fan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/basketball-fan.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"They're playing baaaaaaaasketbaaaaaaall!

Let’s be real: There will never be another day when the Charlotte Bobcats rank atop the Eastern Conference standings or the Utah Jazz, in a reputably tough conference like the West. Even the few minutes that allow starting players to get their feet wet and shoot the Spalding is exciting to watch with the 2015 NBA season just three weeks away.</p>\n<p>Certainly we have not been deprived of basketball since the Golden State Warriors’ 4-2 NBA Finals victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. From the NBA Draft, Free Agency, Summer League, Pro-Am tournaments, the Drew League, FIBA basketball and more it was an entertaining offseason leading up to now.</p>\n<p>A lack of defense and half-hearted play are the primary reasons many NBA players put up points in the 50s, 60s, 70s and more in these recreational summer league games. But the joy of these traditional five-on-five, my guys versus your guys, blacktop type of atmosphere that lives in these games is so enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Sure, the most minutes that a starting lineup might play during the preseason is the first quarter, but seeing the newest free agent signees, rookies, even the newest uniforms and sneakers on the court brings about an abundance of exhilarating emotions.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of a fan who genuinely admires the game of basketball, the most enticing thing about the return of NBA basketball is the fact that its best players will finally all be back healthy. As Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James and Anthony Davis each dominated the 2014-2015 season, and a well-deserved MVP was awarded to Chef Curry, things just weren’t the same without the Black Mamba and Durantula on the court.</p>\n<p>It has been a while since the NBA’s best players have all been healthy at the same time, and this season may be the first time in a long time that we get to witness the association’s top players night in and night out.<br>\nKobe Bryant’s field goal percentage suffered from all of his shot attempts, but the Mamba definitely has something left in the tank entering his 20th season. Can you honestly say that you expected Kobe to average 22.3 points per game, which at the time was third-best in the NBA, after tearing his Achilles in 2013 only to return and play in just six games before fracturing a bone near his left knee?</p>\n<p>Watching him and second overall pick D’Angelo Russell play on the same court in the Lakers’ preseason debut against the Utah Jazz was exciting despite Bryant’s 1-of-5 shooting performance in 12 minutes. All eyes are on the Lake Show and if they can rekindle the dynasty’s winning ways in hopes of sending Kobe off with one last playoff appearance in what may be the end of his illustrious career.</p>\n<p>I refuse to let this so-called “beef” between Stephen A. Smith and Kevin Durant spoil my anticipation of the 2014 MVP’s return to the hardwood. While Russell Westbrook had one of the best post-All-Star break performances, earning 11 triple-doubles, the absence of Durant definitely limited the Oklahoma City Thunder in their chase for the eighth seed. After reinjuring a jones fracture in his foot for the second time, causing him to miss 55 games last season, Durant was finally fully cleared for training camp this season and should be in the team’s starting lineup for the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Thunders’ first preseason game was yesterday. Durant played 22 minutes in the team’s preseason opener, scoring 15 points while shooting 5-of-8 from the field.</p>\n<p>Although not mentioned earlier, let’s hope that Derrick Rose’s fractured left orbital is the last of his injuries. Talent such as his is rare as Rose is the youngest MVP in NBA history.</p>\n<p>The 2015-2016 NBA season opens on Tuesday, October 27th.
