The UCSB baseball team, which currently sits at 20-25, will be heading to Cal State Fullerton to face the No. 15 nationally ranked Titans, who are 29-16.</p>\n<p>Games 1 and 2 of the three-game series will be aired on national television, with ESPNU providing coverage on the opening game and FOX Sports Prime Ticket for the second matchup. Game 3, which begins Sunday at 1 p.m., has yet to have any scheduled TV broadcasting. Some may wonder why there’s so much hype surrounding the upcoming series considering the fact that the Gauchos don’t have much to play for; however, there are a few reasons why one should pay attention to the slate of games.</p>\n<p><strong>1) The Gauchos will be playing inspired baseball. </strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>You can bet your bottom dollar that UCSB is sick and tired of hearing about how amazing Cal State Fullerton has been all season long. After coming off a College World Series campaign, the pain of another school within your own conference potentially being able to experience the same thing you did last year is a deep one, especially if you’re one of the returners. To compensate, the Gauchos will be fired up while going into enemy territory to take on the No. 15 team in the country.</p>\n<p><strong>2) UCSB Baseball has a lot of pride on the line.</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach Andrew Checketts and his coaching staff will not be playing around with their lineup during this series as we have seen lately. Expect to see a lineup similar to what we have seen all year long. Guys on the DL, such as junior second baseman Colton Burns and sophomore ace Noah Davis, might make an appearance knowing that this series can give momentum to the team heading into next year. As much as coaches and players will tell you until they’re blue in the face about how last year’s series don’t matter, they do and people remember.</p>\n<p><strong>3) The ‘Chos have an opportunity to play spoiler.</strong></p>\n<p>As it stands, the Titans are second place in the Big West Conference with a 10-5 conference record on the tail of Long Beach State. On top of this, Cal Poly is only one game behind Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have the fun opportunity to ruin a potential region bid for CSF and play spoiler. If UCSB wins the series, Cal Poly can take its spot in second while Long Beach State can run away with the conference. This would be a monumental blow, considering Cal State Fullerton was once ranked as high as No. 4 in the nation after beating some competitive teams poised to contend deep into the season.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Friday, the projected starter for the Gauchos is junior left-handed pitcher Kyle Nelson. Nelson’s last outing against UC Davis was fantastic; he got the win, going nine full innings while giving up three earned runs and striking out six in the process.</p>\n<p>Nelson will square off against the Titans’ junior ace Connor Seabold. Seabold is 7-4 on the year with a 2.81 ERA.  In the righty’s last start, Seabold got the win at Hawaii, pitching eight innings, giving up one earned run and striking out seven.</p>\n<p>The series will continue the next day, during which Noah Davis is expected to return to the rotation. The sophomore has been out for a couple of weeks with an undisclosed injury, but in his last outing on April 21 against San Diego State, Davis pitched impressively, going 7.1 innings with one earned run and six strikeouts.</p>\n<p>His anticipated competition is CSUF’s John Gavin, a lefty with a 5-2 record and 3.33 ERA. Gavin’s last outing was also against Hawaii, but the junior Titan lost the decision, pitching six innings and giving up four earned runs to the Rainbow Warriors. However, the lefty did strike out eight.</p>\n<p>Make sure to tune in to watch some of the best baseballs the Gauchos will face this season. In many ways, this series will be a benchmark for what’s to come from the team moving forward, as many players are expected to return next season.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/","id":4260,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

After a scoreless fourth by both teams, a pair of runs was netted again by the home squad, this time off of an AJ Sawyer RBI single, and a RBI ground out from Contreras making the score 6-0 after five full innings.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen kicked off the Gaucho sixth with a single to right field. He would come to score on the next hit making the score 6-1 coming off a double from the bat redshirt freshman Tommy Jew who has quickly become one of the brightest spots of UCSB’s young line-up. Despite the 1 for 5 outing, the center fielder is only one of three Gauchos batting above .300 and the only freshman doing so.</p>\n<p>Despite the RBI double with no outs, the Gauchos failed to score any more runs in the inning leaving Jew on base after Highlander pitcher Trenton Toplikar got the next three outs in succession once he replaced Alex Fagalde who is now 6-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>The top half of the next frame, junior first baseman Austin Bush would come to the plate and smack a double to left center scoring two runs making the score 6-3 after seven innings. Bush would finish the day 2 for 4 with 4 RBI’s and has now has improved his hitting streak to five games.</p>\n<p>Again after failing to score more runs despite only having one out in the top of the seventh, the Gauchos had still cut into the lead leaving them with hope of a comeback. UCR took away that hope in the eighth inning as three runs were scored off of junior relief right-handed pitcher Alex Garcia who saw his first action since pitching 0.1 of an inning on April 11th against Nevada.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior catcher Tony Gudino netted two of the three runs with a single to right field before Contreras would attain his third RBI of the day off of another single. Contreras would finish the day 3 for 4 with three runs batted in.</p>\n<p>Not being able to muster even one out, Garcia came out having allowed the three runs. With the UCSB bullpen being the mess that it is, the Gauchos were forced to throw backup catcher Thomas Rowan on the mound to try to get out of the inning.</p>\n<p>Rowan did actually have experience pitching beforehand as in high school in his junior year he was 7-1 with a 1.81 ERA, but facing high schoolers and Division-I college athletes are completely different.</p>\n<p>To the redshirt sophomore’s credit, he did get out of the inning unscathed allowing only two hits but giving up no runs and actually striking out one batter. It was a great sight to see an athlete step up and make plays from a position he is not used too, but being in a position to have to throw Rowan out on the mound is proof of how bad things are in the pen for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final inning down 9-3, UCSB scored two more runs off of another Bush double, but it would obviously not be enough as it would fall 9-5.</p>\n<p>Once again, this loss is indicative of how the Gauchos have lost most of their games: their pitching staff. Being short-staffed is always tough, and having inconsistency from starters and relievers makes any coaches job tougher but UCSB needs to somehow make ends meet.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to miss the postseason which would be very disappointing, and at this point is basically an inevitability, but it’s another entirely if this team never even breaks the .500 bubble.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Andrew Checketts has had a tough go at it this year, but having just been given a contract extension, we know he is here to stay, and at this point, him possibly being able to develop the young talent seems to be the only positive in UCSB baseball.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finish the series tomorrow at 2 p.m. at UCR stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
