Article II of the Constitution of the ASUCSB, section A affirms, “all students shall have the right to an affordable education.”</p>\n<p>ASUCSB’s strong relationship with the United States Student Association (USSA) has facilitated students from UCSB to advocate on important issues of access and affordability at the federal level. This recent advocacy work includes the passage of the Student Aid Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA) in 2010. SAFRA increased the maximum Pell Grant to $5,500 and ended subsidies to private loan companies, redirecting millions of dollars to direct loans. Throughout this process, ASUCSB worked with USSA Legislative Director Angela Peoples who personally knocked on every door in Congress to lobby on SAFRA.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The year after SAFRA was passed, 35 percent of UCSB received Federal Pell Grants and 49 percent of students borrowed student loans.

The film, based on its screenwriters’ own true love story, weaves a clash of cultures, medical mystery and search for identity with the classic boy-meets-girl formula to produce a story both grounded and comical.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 3, the Carsey-Wolf Center welcomed Academy Award-nominated screenwriters, Emily V. Gordon and Nanjiani to the Pollock Theater as part of their Script to Screen series. After a screening of “The Big Sick,” the pair, who have been married since 2007, sat down with Pollock Theater director Matthew Ryan to discuss the film’s script. The film has experienced extraordinary financial and critical success, becoming the most successful independent film release of 2017 and amassing countless awards, including an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nanjiani, best known for his starring role in HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” also stars as the film’s lead character, a fictitious version of himself. The character is a stand-up comedian torn between the expectations of his traditional Pakistani family and his love for Emily, an American psychology graduate student played by Zoe Kazan. The plot thickens when Emily ends up in the hospital with a mysterious illness, which results in her being placed in a medically induced coma. Emily’s coma marks the arrival of her parents, played by the legendary Holly Hunter and Ray Romano, who challenge Kumail’s issues of identity and vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The pair revealed that creating the film’s script from their own story was not always an easy process. They first created a “puke draft” which consisted of 164 pages of raw, unstructured story drawn from their personal experiences. Gordon explained that adapting this version of the script would be impossible as it contained too much detail and would not translate well onto screen.</p>\n<p>“Real lives are boring,” she said “It’s the structure which makes a story interesting.”</p>\n<p>Slowly, over the course of three years, the couple edited down the story, creating a solid narrative comprised of what felt relevant to them.</p>\n<p>As they got further along in the writing process, the couple realized that some moments of their own story, which initially seemed important, did not entirely fit into the film. The duo did not mind changing or embellishing the truth, as they were not aiming to create a biopic, but the best story they could possibly tell. Gordon and Nanjiani did, however, try to sneak personal anecdotes into the film, like Kumail’s love of “The X-Files” and Emily’s favorite brain T-shirt, for example.</p>\n<p>Nanjiani noted that it was important to create a flawed when attempting to mirror himself. He explained that oftentimes when individuals are involved with the production of their own stories, the stories morph into vanity projects, portraying themselves as perfect and idealistic.</p>\n<p>“Why would I want to play someone who doesn’t grow by the end of the story?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The writing process also proved to be somewhat introspective. Nanjiani found that writing scenes based on his own family dynamic allowed him to see his parents’ perspective more clearly.</p>\n<p>On crafting characters in general, the pair elaborated that their main goal was for the audience to thoroughly understand all their characters. “</p>\n<p>You’re supposed to understand the character’s viewpoint but not agree with them,” Gordon said. “Nobody’s right, nobody’s wrong. Everyone just has different opinions.”</p>\n<p>This empathetic dogma brings layers of warmth and credibility to the film, as each character is given a sincere viewpoint rooted in genuine emotions.</p>\n<p>Portraying a real relationship was also of high importance to the screenwriters. Gordon explained that while she is a fan of romantic comedies, the relationships depicted in them kind of just fall rigidly into place. People are “more resistant” to love in real relationships. She also found that the female characters of rom-coms often come as an afterthought to their male counterparts.</p>\n<p>“The men decide everything, but they are in a relationship together,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>The couple’s commitment to an authentic script manifests itself in every scene of the hilarious comedy, which had the Pollock consumed in countless uproars of laughter throughout the screening. <em>The Big Sick</em> champions the romantic comedy genre, delivering humor, heart and reality while simultaneously staying true to its roots.</p>\n<p><em>The Big Sick</em> is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/","id":5813,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[5812,5811,5810],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Regardless Of The Occasion, It Is Best To Just Beat It","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Masturbating is part of my everyday life.

Watch the director’s cut of “127 Hours” and you’ll see James Franco beating off with his free hand every other scene between sips of precious water. After he cut his arm off, you don’t want to know what he did with that thing. Spoiler alert … the movie should have been called “The Stranger.”</p>\n<p>Boners have a mind of their own. They’re uncontrollable. It can strike a man at any time, like lightning. Except lightning has it easy. It’s in and out of there. FLASH! And it’s gone. Boners, those guys make their appearance and they just stand there. That thing is going to linger like a broken finger … unless you beat it off and send that little guy back to the flaccid existence from which it came from. Just like our good ol’ friend Jesus, that thing will resurrect itself with a Second Coming — in the next 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Beating off does wonders for me. It’s like an Aderall/sanity pill that I can never overdose on. Before I talk to a girl, rub it out. Before I party, rub it out. Before I go to class, I’ll rub it out. Before I wrote this article, I’m not going to lie — I rubbed it out. And as a reward for finishing the article, I’ll most likely rub it out again later.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Masturbation by itself is completely natural and a necessary means to an end of releasing that testosterone and sexual tension. If you don’t masturbate, your body will literally do it for you while you sleep.</p>\n<p>After I masturbate, my logic and reasoning are sharp and centered. Like a born-again Christian, I can see the light. However, not beating off can be more distorting than beer goggles. It’s like having Satan between my legs while he holds my angel hostage in my nut sack. If I don’t masturbate, sanity goes right out the window. I start making compromises and excuses to convince myself of the most ridiculous things: That girl across the room is kinda, actually alright looking or that sending a text message at two in the morning to the girl I met last week on Del Playa Drive is a great idea. Why do you think guys made a “hotness” rating scale and have “standards?” These are sober beacons of truth to hopefully guide the lost, horny individual out of a midnight crisis.</p>\n<p>Holding off on masturbation can turn a man’s sanity into a cross-mojonation of horniness and aggression. Next time you’re out on DP at two in the morning on a weekend, watch for the guys walking alone and you can tell pretty easily who beat off that night and who is trying to fight the entire 6500 block.</p>\n<p>All you females out there who don’t check your midnight oil might as well go to class all quarter, never open your books and take the final. Sure, some of you can fake your way through it or get a pass/no pass, but the ones who do their homework are the ones who get the honors credit.</p>\n<p>In order for a woman to be on her “A” game she has got to know what’s under the hood. The vagina is so fucking complicated as it is. I mean, there’s a lot going on down there with a labia minora and a labia majora and a vulva this and a vulva that. It’s crazy! It can even be accessorized with clit rings. I’m not even kidding, the clit literally has its own built-in designer hoodie. Am I the only one who feels they’re dissecting the pussy like a science experiment?</p>\n<p>God’s most complicated piece of equipment and He can’t even give us a direction’s manual or something to go by. He leaves us in the dark like a scrambled GPS. You know a simple commandment would have been nice! Thou shall not insert thy penis into thy wife’s pussy without sufficient foreplay.</p>\n<p>Fucking girls who masturbate often and those who don’t are night and day in the sack (or wherever inspiration may strike). How can you expect me to know how to get you off if you don’t even know yourself? The ones who do masturbate often know exactly what gets them off, ride on top far better and cum much faster and harder than girls who don’t masturbate.</p>\n<p>So when a guy asks you, “Do you masturbate?” We already know the answer, ladies. Of fucking course you do! We just want to hear you say it so we can go home and beat off to that later. You’re telling me that you have a gaping hole in your body and you’ve never been curious to stick your finger(s), dildos or conspicuously shaped fruits and vegetables up there?! You’re lying behind that queefing little twat of yours. If I had a hole like that, I’d be sticking everything up there. I’d be like Link from the Legend of Zelda just pulling out all sorts of shit like my Orca, class reader, a spare blue book, a 5-hour Energy and of course, some wet naps if there’s room.</p>\n<p>Ladies, I’m on your side here. There’s no shame in masturbation. Be patient and the good things will most certainly cum. I want you to unleash the freak within and find what Alice really did down her rabbit hole. Don’t do it for me. Do it for you. Do it for America. Heck, I’ll do it to you doing it to America, right now — I’m totally serious. I’m writing here to tell you ladies, on this soap box (of K-Y Jelly) that the double standard for masturbation is a thing of the past and hoards of dildos are vibrating their way into the future.</p>\n<p>The Literary Delicatessen is a fourth-year philosophy major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/","id":5814,"author":{"id":556,"name":"Literary Delicatessen"},"related":[5813,5812,5811],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Arrival’ Makes a Smooth Landing at Pollock","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=384%2C600&ssl=1","description":"'Arrival' stresses the coming together of people in spite of differences, the circularity and recurring connections of all things.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Carsey-Wolf center kicked off their winter season on Tuesday with a Script To Screen event featuring recent first contact thriller “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrival”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a critical and box office success.

But Heiserrer noted how this decision was a matter of production as well as emotion: because of the reveal that (and once more, major spoilers follow) Louise’s flashbacks are in fact flashforwards due to the Tralfamadorian nonlinear perception of time imparted by learning the language of the heptapods, they would’ve had to age Amy Adams up, disrupting their own reveal had they let her daughter make it a little longer. “That blows everything,” Heisserer observes, going on to comment on the nature of her character’s temporally-questionable decision to have a child who she knows will die young that “it may be deterministic but we’re unaware of that, we still feel like we have choice.” He finds this paradox of determinism and free will makes Louise’s decision to raise her doomed daughter even more emotionally profound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the tricky way the script plays with time and audience assumptions, Adams’ opportunities for subtlety in her portrayal of Louise were numerous. Heisserer cherished her skill, attesting, “when you have a phenomenal actor that embodies a role for you, you find out just how little dialogue at places you actually need.” This plays out in subsequent viewings for those who’ve already learned the truths of heptapod thinking, and even Heisserer commented, “I certainly still find myself discovering things in Amy Adam’s performance that I didn’t catch in earlier screenings.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74817\" style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"849367051\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74816\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74817\" data-attachment-id=\"74817\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/arrivalposter/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=384%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"384,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"arrivalposter\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?fit=384%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74817 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=384%2C600\" alt=\"Courtesy of Pollock Theater\" width=\"384\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?w=384&amp;ssl=1 384w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arrivalposter.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pollock Theater</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another change Heisserer made during adaptation included increasing the military presence for dramatic tension’s sake, and along those same lines, the actual arrival of the seven-legged, hand-squid hybrid heptapods, themselves. Heisserer spoke of how in Chiang’s story the heptapods contact humanity via Skype-like technology, but how there’s “no tension at all there;” “what does that do geopolitically,” he asks, when the aliens arrive at our front door?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The writer spoke about changes he made during his own process as well. For a long while, the “gift” the heptapods intend to endow humanity with comprised not of their language and its time-transcendent influence, but of “different pieces of technology to make a ship so that we could… venture off and explore the stars on our own… and then </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interstellar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came out.” Aside from not wanting to hijack another film’s motif, Heisserer and director Denis Villeneuve didn’t want to leave their audiences with the impression that humanity had screwed up irrevocably; indeed, they opted instead to champion human cooperation and unity, reinforced by the circular, complexly interrelated nature of the alien language that fosters it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Ryan, joking about being unable to place graphics in scriptwriting software Final Cut, asked about the presentation of the logograms of the heptapod language on paper, Heisserer mentioned being wary of getting too novelistic in his descriptions about them. Spurred by a suggestion from his wife, he left spaces in the script and inserted the graphics manually. “I did that a hundred times,” he remarked, “I’m an idiot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heiserrer described working with Villeneuve as “phenomenal.” In his previous experience, handing a script to a director “feels more like, sort of a hostage tradeoff on a bridge.” Imitating one of these past directors, he joked “maybe I’ll remember your name at the premier.” But Villeneuve was different. Heisserer described the long courtship period before the director attached himself to the project, where they would sit at coffee shops discussing philosophy, science, and religion. After five or six of these intellectual dates, he received a call from his new friend; imitating the director’s French-Canadian accent, he recounts the conversation that made the movie happen: “Ok Eric, now we are married.” The amount of care Villeneuve poured into the project really impressed Heisserer, citing him as the only director to give him calls to check the soundness of any changes he planned on making. This care carried throughout their Montreal crew. According to the writer, even the gaffers and grips read his script, creating a productive environment where “we were all trying to make the same movie.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This crew unity was appropriate then, as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrival” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stresses the coming together of people in spite of differences, the circularity and recurring connections of all things. The details Heisserer shared with the intrigued audience Tuesday night elucidated this and more, proving a revelatory experience in line with a course of Heptapod 101.</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the rest of this season’s upcoming Carsey-Wolf events, including more Script to Screens and a 35mm film Hitchcock series, at <a href=\"http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/pollock\">http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/pollock</a>.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74816\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74816\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/arrival-makes-a-smooth-landing-at-pollock/","id":5815,"author":{"id":703,"name":"Frankie Horne"},"related":[5814,5813,5812],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
