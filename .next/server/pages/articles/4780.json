Clinic building, where I.V. residents, students and administrators <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/\">continued a discussion</a> that has been taking place over the last several months regarding the establishment of self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Demographics, parking issues, legislative challenges and uncertainty surrounding I.V.’s exact population were among the issues discussed during Tuesday’s forum. The meeting is one in a series that Williams will host, with the next town hall meeting to continue the I.V. self-governance discussion scheduled for Feb. 5 at Santa Barbara Hillel on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said there are difficulties involved with researching I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“I think there are going to be hidden populations that are difficult to count,” Thurlow said. “There very well could be hangers on, which are people who have gone to school here and they’re just kind of off the radar and they’re just hanging out here.”</p>\n<p>According to Thurlow, some I.V. residents live in garages and split bedrooms, a situation not accounted for in typical census counting.</p>\n<p>“There’s the situation that one of my students explained,” Thurlow said. “She lives in three-bedroom house with two people living in the garage and two people living in each bedroom. And that’s not showing up in the census data.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista. – I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thurow said one suggestion is to use student researchers to calculate I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking to [UCSB sociology professor] Victor Rios about having his spring class do a door-to-door survey in Isla Vista just to get a demographic number,” Thurow said. “Right now what we’re trying to do is use students to figure out as close as possible how many people really live in Isla Vista and who they are.”</p>\n<p>I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar said she is concerned with the impacted parking situation in I.V and how the Campus 880 Apartments have contributed to the issue.</p>\n<p>“Now some of the property owners, even though they’re now being required to provide parking for their housing that they’re building, they’re charging for it,” Soutar said. “And so what we found when 880 went up, because you just threw three or four hundred people in, all of a sudden all those cars showed up to fill our little park parking lot and the entire neighborhood around there got even more impacted and the parking lot is sitting only partially full.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said paid permits for parking on the street in I.V. was previously suggested to solve the congested parking but was denied by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency that regulates and protects beach access to the public.</p>\n<p>“Years ago we tried it and it was going to be Isla Vista-wide and the thought was maybe it would be 50 dollars a year to help facilitate and run the program so we wouldn’t have to go after a grant or anything like that,” Soutar said. “The problem that happened with that parking plan was the Coastal Commission.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the Coastal Commission had concerns that parking permits would prohibit public access to the beach.</p>\n<p>“The Coastal Commission was like, ‘Hey if you need a permit to park in Isla Vista how are you gonna access the beach,” Souter said.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the parking problem needs to be addressed so that residents can find safe parking places near their homes.</p>\n<p>“Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista,” Soutar said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets. – Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz</p></blockquote>\n<p>Local business owner Jay Freeman said the high cost of parking permits on campus can also be problematic because it causes first-year students to park in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As far as UCSB is concerned, freshman don’t really have cars because they have a process for buying permits to store cars as freshman,” Freeman said, “When you look at the permit numbers for that, virtually no one is using that process. Instead, if they’re bringing cars, they must be putting them somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz said she agrees that many students avoid parking fees by leaving their car on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“That’s exactly what my friends would do while they were living in FT,” De la Cruz said. “It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said students should be included in the planning process to address I.V. parking.</p>\n<p>“I would really like to see programs that offered scholarships or prizes to people who develop the best new traffic system in Isla Vista, including parking, including bike lanes,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“At that point you get five or six different proposals in front of you and as a community we can see what we really like . . . it provides an opportunity for students involved.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, a representative from Williams’ office, said concrete plans must be added to AB-3, the I.V. self-governance bill proposed by Williams in the California State Assembly, which needs to be amended to include definite plans for a local government.</p>\n<p>“We absolutely have to amend the bill by mid-March in order to keep it alive or else it just goes away because now the language that’s in there can’t even be assigned to a committee,” Elliott said. “The legislature couldn’t even vote on it right now because it would do nothing . . . We could park it in a committee for however long we need.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/","id":4780,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4779,4778,4777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Arrest Suspect in Stabbing","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-bookingJPG.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-bookingJPG.jpg?resize=480%2C640&ssl=1","description":"A 21-year-old UCSB student was stabbed at the house of Sigma Chi Omega on the 6700 block of Sueno Road in Isla Vista about 2:45a.m, following an altercation just outside the house.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60082\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60082\" data-attachment-id=\"60082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-24/police-arrest-suspect-in-stabbing/ruiz-booking-photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\" data-orig-size=\"480,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ruiz booking photo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo-188x250.bmp\" data-large-file=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\" class=\"wp-image-60082\" src=\"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ruiz-booking-photo.bmp\" alt=\"Kevin Ruiz.

The victim sustained knife injuries to the chest and head and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for treatment, where he is currently stable. Following the incident, Ruiz was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, a felony subject to up to four years in state prison and a maximum $10,000 fine, and bail has been set at $30,000.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega president and third-year psychology and economics major Jason Ouyang said Ruiz was heavily intoxicated and was accompanied by a “female accomplice,” both of whom approached the fraternity and demanded entry to a private gathering at the house.</p>\n<p>“We were having a small get-together, ourselves and our friends, and this person was not allowed entry into our house,” Ouyang said. “The guy was very aggressive and probably under the influence of alcohol … my brothers wouldn’t let him come in and he took that very personally and he tried to start a fight … he pulled out some sort of weapon and gave him a couple lacerations.”</p>\n<p>Sheriff’s Office officials denied requests for additional information on the incident.</p>\n<p>Ouyang said the incident was unprecedented and the fraternity never has issues keeping people from coming into private gatherings.</p>\n<p>“In this situation I guess that person wasn’t gonna take no for an answer,” Ouyang said. “Usually there’s never problems like this; this is the very first time something to this has occurred — its a little traumatizing.”</p>\n<p>According to Ouyang, the fraternity would gather in the next few days to assess the situation and focus on the group.</p>\n<p>“We’re all just kinda shaken by it but at the same time we can’t let that deter us,” Ouyang said.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega is a multicultural social fraternity and part of the Multicultural Greek Council on campus.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is requesting that anyone with information contact Isla Vista Foot Patrol investigators at (805) 683-2724, or in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office, located at 6504 Trigo Road. Anonymous tips can also be provided via telephone, at (805) 681-4171.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

been scheduled for trial on March 24 and faces charges of assault, resisting arrest and causing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Edwards, who was 17 years old at the time of his arrest in April and is now being tried as an adult, allegedly struck UCPD police officer Tony Magaña in the face with a backpack containing glass bottles of liquor after being pursued by authorities down the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive on April 5. The incident sparked onlookers to begin throwing rocks and bottles at deputies who came to provide reinforcement and ultimately degenerated into a full scale riot between revelers and police, ending with police shutting down DP and firing on crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year financial math and statistics and French double major Sophie Talbot said she had just woken up from a nap when the Deltopia riots broke out and stayed inside her house on the 6500 block of DP while she watched the violence unfold.</p>\n<p>“[Edwards] should be treated as a criminal that assaulted a police officer and also as someone who ruined a community as a whole,” Talbot said in an email. “Not only did people get hurt, but it also completely screwed up a place we call home.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair and second-year art major Roberto Pérez said Edwards acted ignorantly when he assaulted Magaña.</p>\n<p>“[With] scarring an officer over something as stupid as getting away with his alcohol, he better expect repercussions for his actions,” Pérez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds. – Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair Roberto Pérez</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Talbot, law enforcement had difficulty controlling the riots because no one could have foreseen the violence that occurred that night.</p>\n<p>“The police and I.V. could have been as prepared as they could have been,” Talbot said in an email. “Never would they have expected someone smashing a bottle on a police officer’s head.”</p>\n<p>Pérez said it is difficult to determine if the riots could have been prevented if Edwards had not assaulted Magaña because of the ambiguity that occurs with large crowds and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s hard to say,” Pérez said in an email. “There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes the events that unfolded in April are not repeated in the future.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like to see students be punished, but at the same time I don’t like to see officers be assaulted,” Schunk said. “What I really hope for is in the future we don’t see events like this occurring as often.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he thinks Isla Vista’s adaptive nature will help prevent Deltopia from being as violent as it was last spring.</p>\n<p>“I don’t foresee anything like this occurring again,” Schunk said. “I think that this year there is a collective feeling that we have to kind of change the culture of Deltopia and make it something that won’t bubble over to what it has become.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/deltopia-rioter-to-be-tried-in-march/","id":4778,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4777,4776,4775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVTU Holds Campaign For Evicted I.V.

According to former tenant Maria Hernandez, she was not notified of the eviction until two days before the deadline. <em>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) hosted a housing forum titled “Tenants Reclaiming Isla Vista” at the Pardall Center in I.V. yesterday in order to gather attention and support for households evicted from their homes at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The forum was the first event in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/\">a three-day campaign</a> to fight for relocation benefits of six long-term, low income residents who were evicted without justification from their apartments at Abrego Villas on Abrego Rd. in late August 2014. The forum included a presentation from IVTU representatives and a Q&amp;A session with the evicted tenants.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, if five or more residencies are evicted from a property within 90 days, the management company is required to provide financial support in the form of “relocation benefits.”</p>\n<p>Following their evictions, the apartments were allegedly renovated and the rent price increased by 50 percent. The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and IVTU sponsored lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to Majestic, the property managers refused to grant them benefits and the tenants then challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors. In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day. – IVTU adviser and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>Subsequent evictions have taken place over 90 days after the initial six evictions, which IVTU believe is part of an effort to avoid further requests for relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>Brian Lezak of Majestic Asset Management, LLC said the company is not directly responsible for the evictions, and that the property owner did not break any rules.</p>\n<p>“Majestic Asset Management, Inc. is not the owner of Abrego Villas, only the management company,” Lezak said. “The ownership complied with the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and therefore did not violate any laws.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said the facts have not been plainly presented, and that Majestic is prepared to defend the owner of Abrego Villas.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said. “We will defend their position in court, which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said Majestic supports IVTU’s purpose, but maintains the company did not violate any regulations.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenant’s in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<p>IVTU advisor and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the event represents an “opportunity for truly engaged community dialogue” on issues relevant to students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors,” said Jones. “In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, while there are laws in place to protect renters, the law does not require property owners to provide any justification for evictions.</p>\n<p>“The laws do not protect folks from just being evicted,” said Jones. “The property owners have a right, if you will, to evict without any just cause.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics major and IVTU president Andrey Bogdanov said issues affecting some I.V. residents should be minded by every student who lives in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We believe that fair housing opportunities are for all, and all residents of Isla Vista should unite together to fight for this,” Bogdanov said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60267\" style=\"width: 610px\"

evictions from 781 Embaradero Del Norte</a>, the tenants were served eviction documents in English, which they were then pressured to sign, despite some tenants’ inability to understand English.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tenants were tricked into waiving their rights,” Bogdanov said. “Some of the tenants were only Spanish speaking and some of the landlords tricked them into signing waivers of their rights which were in English.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said the tenants most recently evicted in October were not offered any justification for their evictions.</p>\n<p>“The tenants were originally very confused, because when they were served eviction notices, the eviction notices did not provide the explanation.”</p>\n<p>Maria Hernandez, a long-term resident and single mother, said

According to her, the eviction placed them in more desperate circumstances.</p>\n<p>“Her baby was days from birth,” Hernandez said. “I didn’t know where we were going to go … we had to go to the house of my daughter’s teacher … we ate on the street.”</p>\n<p>Vincenta Martinez, who lived in the apartments for 10 years prior to her eviction, said she had emigrated from Mexico to escape poverty and that she was unable to understand her eviction notice because of her limited understanding of English.</p>\n<p>“When I received the notice, I read a little bit because I read only a little English,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>According to Adriana Delmarsh, who lived in the apartments for 13 years, she had been charged late fees for checks lost by the owners in the past and thought that that may have prompted her eviction. Martinez said attempts to cooperate with management were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>“I saw the notice and immediately called the general manager, Jackie Lopez,” said Delmarsh. “I called her but I did not get a response.”</p>\n<p>According to Delmarsh, she would have had her neighbors help her understand the notice, but she works long hours and could not contact them.</p>\n<p>“I work from eight in the morning until seven at night,” said Delmarsh. “I don’t have time for listening to my neighbors.”</p>\n<p>Paola Villegas, a third-year history of public policy major, said her family was nearly evicted when she was eight years old and understands the tenants’ plight.</p>\n<p>“Housing discrimination has been incredibly present in my life and their story resonates with me so deeply,” Villegas said.</p>\n<p>“Housing is a right; it’s not a commodity,” said Villegas. “It’s so dehumanizing to see how they’re treated.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted IVTU president, Andrey Bogdanov, stating the five tenants evicted in October were tricked into waiving their rights. Bogdanov was actually referring to issues related to a series of evictions that occurred in 2013.
