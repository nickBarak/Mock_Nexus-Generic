We really try to make it so that everybody can hear and participate.”</p>\n<p>Vernon McCaslin, who owns a local business and works with veterans, was concerned about the impact on handicapped parking.</p>\n<p>“The plan needs to be thought out better,” McCaslin said. “[City Council hasn’t] offered a viable solution for what they are going to do with businesses, cars and people that go to those businesses.”</p>\n<p>Mike Ober, a UCSB alumnus and an architect, said a bicycle lane would be more valuable than parking spaces.</p>\n<p>“The primary purpose of streets is to facilitate the movement of people,” Ober said. “Free parking is a bonus. All [that space] is just free parking that anyone has a right to.”</p>\n<p>Ober said that because more people are commuting via bike, there will be more parking spaces available.</p>\n<p>“Every day that I ride a bike instead of drive, there’s going to be one more parking space — one more precious, beautiful, asphalt parking space — just waiting,” Ober said. “I think once the emotions settle, people will realize making biking more accessible and safe will result in additional parking.”</p>\n<p>Joey Juhasz-Lukomski, operations manager for the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition, said it is “so valuable” to have a complete and connected bike pathway.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s going to encourage more people to ride their bikes,” Juhasz-Lukomski said. “That’s going to be more people biking downtown, which could actually free up more parking spaces because there will be less people driving downtown.”</p>\n<p>Omar Uribe, Santa Barbara City College student, said he is looking forward to safer bike travel after the Master Plan is implemented.</p>\n<p>“As a bicyclist, I know that [Micheltorena] has no bike lanes,” Uribe said. “I’ve been close to getting hit a couple times, and I’ve seen people get hit on that street.”</p>\n<p>Ober said bicycle safety should be a primary concern for the Council when considering the Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“A lot of motorists get passionate about parking or keeping streets for cars, but for them, it’s a convenience issue,” Ober said. “For cyclists, it’s a safety issue. It’s life and death.”</p>\n<p>Ober said his time spent on UCSB’s campus helped him discover the efficiency of biking.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is a lovely place to discover cycling as a practical way of getting around,” Ober said. “I lived on 6800 block of DP [Del Playa Drive]. I also lived on Phelps [Road] which is out by Costco. It taught me that it is way faster to ride a bike to get to class.”</p>\n<p>Tiffany Wu, second-year economics and accounting major chair of the A.S. Bicycle Committee, said she is pleased with the Council’s decision.</p>\n<p>“I’m really glad they passed it because it’s more sustainable and a lot safer for students because we are part of the community as well,” Wu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The resolution, titled “A Resolution of the City Council of the City of Goleta, California Establishing Temporary Resident Only On-Street Parking Restrictions Related to the 2016 Isla Vista Deltopia Event,” will be in place from 9 a.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Although Deltopia is expected to occur the weekend of April 2, City staff requested authorization to implement the parking restrictions for the weekends of April 2 and April 9 to allow for flexibility should the date change.</p>\n<p>Last Deltopia, Goleta implemented a temporary ban on street parking on certain high-traffic blocks of I.V. Based on a survey of residents and testimonies of law enforcement and City personnel following the weekend, City staff concluded temporary parking restrictions are effective and meet residents’ needs.</p>\n<p>Deputy City Clerk Liana Campos presented the City staff’s report recommending City Council pass the resolution.</p>\n<p>The report calls on UCSB to encourage students to park on campus while the restrictions are in place.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is expected to take the same measures for this spring’s event.

to change very quickly with the use of social media.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia is not to be confused with a series of sanctioned UCSB events generally known as “Spring Warm Up” that occur in the same time period,” the report said. “Potentially upwards of 25,000 people could pass through Goleta for this Isla Vista event.”</p>\n<p>The parking restriction area would have the boundaries of Cannon Green Drive to the west, Hollister Avenue to the north, Storke Road to the east and Whittier Drive to the south — making up the Goleta neighborhoods known as University 1 and University 2.</p>\n<p>“Parking permits would be required to be taped to the inside of the vehicle’s driver’s side window during the restricted hours,” the report said. “Vehicles found parked on any of the streets in the University 1-2 neighborhoods during the restricted times, not displaying the appropriate parking permit, would be subject to ticketing and/or towing.”</p>\n<p>The recommendation to the City passed unanimously

The youth workshops included a sexual education discussion, a college panel on identity expression and a series of “coming out” monologues. There was also a tutorial on “dragging” and a drag performance closed the conference.</p>\n<p>Reverend Alyssa De Wolf said attendees of all ages were able to benefit from the conference, particularly parents of LGBTQ youth.</p>\n<p>“I think the parents especially had a lot of time to meet other adults and other people who are working with LGBTQ students and I think got a lot of extra resources today too,” De Wolf said. “We’re trying to really strengthen not just the kids, but really strengthen the people who are working with kids so that we can be a better and stronger community.”</p>\n<p>De Wolf said she hopes the church’s future LGBTQ Youth Conferences will be longer and feature more speakers.</p>\n<p>“My vision is that it grows and grows,” De Wolf said. “I envision bringing in bigger speakers, more people, doing it maybe even more than one day, but really getting the word out and making it the sort of thing people come to every year and that kids especially get excited about every year.”</p>\n<p>Drag performer and 2012 Santa Barbara Queen of Pride Deja Re said she hoped kids left the conference feeling sure of their environment.</p>\n<p>“I think them having this safe place to go to and to really express themselves is great,” Re said. “It’s so great to see these kids at such a young age really know who they are and who they want to be.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Isabelle Tranner said she learned from people sharing their experiences of coming out to their friends and families.</p>\n<p>“I really liked sitting in on the ‘coming out’ panel,” Tranner said. “It was just people discussing their experiences coming out, and some of the issues and joys of coming out and that was really interesting to hear, especially from people younger than me.”</p>\n<p>Director of the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network Rachel Gloger said she hopes LGBTQ youth can feel physically and mentally safe and fully accept their identities.</p>\n<p>“The more safe spaces we can provide for these kids, the stronger their sense of community will be and the stronger their mental health outcomes are,” Gloger said. “I think the outcome of these events is just letting our town know that we have a lot of LGBT kids that we’re really proud of, and we’re proud to support them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fearing for the woman’s safety, an officer detained the man and began questioning him.</p>\n<p>The man was aggravated and began yelling that the officer was harassing him. The officer tried to ask the subject why he refused to leave the woman alone, but the man only responded by calling the officer a “douche bag” and saying he was not intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The subject’s friends urged the man to behave, but he went on a rant, and said he wished the deputy would lose his job, and demanded his badge number.</p>\n<p>The man was obviously wasted, and was placed under arrest for public intoxication. The man continually stated that he wished to have a Breathalyzer to prove that he was not intoxicated, and said that he knew his rights.</p>\n<p>“The right to remain silent, the right to a trial and some other shit like that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Dramatically, the man improved the Miranda Rights adding, “And the right not to be arrested by a douche bag like that,” as he gestured to deputy.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>19 Going On… Seven?<br>\nFriday, Sept 15, 1:21 a.m. – Officers walking through the intersection of Camino del Sur and Del Playa Drive observed two men arguing on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>An 18-year-old man was sitting on the curb, and an unknown man was standing in between his legs. The men were fighting about whether the seated subject had spit on someone.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted the men and noted the seated man displayed signs of intoxication including glassy eyes and a strong odor of alcohol.</p>\n<p>The officer contacted the man to check his welfare.</p>\n<p>The subject told the deputy that he did not know where he lived. He stated that he was 19 years old, then said he was 18.</p>\n<p>In a possible attempt to confuse the officer, the man then said he was born on Sept. 19, 1999, making him seven years old.</p>\n<p>The deputy decided the man was too intoxicated – and apparently too young – to care for his safety or the safety of others, and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-11986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-09-28/police-blotter-8/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-11986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-09-28/police-blotter-8/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-09-28/police-blotter-8/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-09-28/police-blotter-8/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-09-28/police-blotter-8/","id":3858,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3857,3856,3855],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
