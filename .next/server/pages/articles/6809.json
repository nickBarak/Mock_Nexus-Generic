Last Friday night, the L.A.-based upstarts known as The Regrettes rocked Santa Barbara with openers nucklehead and Pancho and The Wizards.<br>\nVelvet Jones holds a unique position among Santa Barbara’s great music venues. Everything about the place elevates it from a simple concert venue to a communal space for like-minded people to mosh and go insane together. There’re the rebellious red walls and lighting. There’s the black-and-white mural of a guitarist flipping off the crowd. There’s the “rock-on” gesture in the Velvet Jones logo behind the stage. It all adds up to form a very welcoming space that feels specialized in the type of community it aims to serve. When talking to fellow concertgoers, a few claimed Velvet Jones as their favorite venue. It’s intimate, but not cramped. It’s punk, but still inviting.</p>\n<p>The night began with Pancho and The Wizards, who perfectly embodied the new California beach punk skater aesthetic. The San Luis Obispo band led by their overalls-wearing frontman Tristan Cole Wildey, or Pancho, showed a lot of potential. Pancho’s vocals perfectly cut through the more noisy backing instrumentation and deliver some funny and tightly written lyrics. The band also did a great job bringing the energy throughout the set with the group’s bassist jamming out in the crowd for a portion of one of the songs. It’s easy to envision Pancho and The Wizards moving up in the punk scene here in California.</p>\n<p>Following Pancho and The Wizards was the Ventura-based punk band nucklehead. This group similarly drew inspiration from the California beach skater punk scene, but went about it a different way. While Pancho’s vocals were clear and crisp and separated themselves from the mix, nucklehead’s vocals were the opposite and utilized heavy mic reverb to create a sound that reminded me of some of the harder Descendants cuts.  As their set was wrapping up, a few audience members yelled out for one of the band’s most popular cuts, “Burrito,” which is about rushing to the toilet after a bad burrito. The crowd went nuts and the beginnings of a mosh pit that would soon envelop Velvet Jones began to form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you find yourself at a show at Velvet Jones on a Friday night, you might find yourself intensely hungry like I was last week. Luckily, at Velvet Jones there’s Mac N Cheese After Dark. I ordered without ever having to leave the building, but you can also order out front, where many drunk clubgoers were taking full advantage of the dish. Then, finally, the main event was here: The Regrettes.</p>\n<p>The audience packed toward the stage as the band came out. While it took a while to get going, by the third song the crowd was going nuts. Bright pastel-colored balloons were knocked about by the jumping mass of people as the moshing got more intense. The energy that filled the room felt so contagious that I rushed into the pit knowing my glasses could be destroyed with one rogue elbow — but I didn’t care. During one of the band’s best songs, “Picture Perfect,” lead singer Lydia Night came into the audience and sang the catchy-as-hell refrain with the crowd as we were all dancing. I guarantee it was the coolest thing that happened in Santa Barbara that night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77376\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"725156750\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77376\" data-attachment-id=\"77376\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/the-regrettes-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"the regrettes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77376\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77376\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Regrettes</p></div>\n<p>As I started getting tired, I moved to the back of the pit to get some air and saw a sound tech a mere 10 to 15 feet away from the pit precariously balancing two iPads filled with green and yellow sound monitors on one arm. I do not understand what he was thinking, but luckily for him, the pit stayed relatively contained, and by the time the infamous wall of death began a few songs later, he was gone. While you might be thinking something called the wall of death seems idiotic and reckless, which I assure you it is, it’s something I had to experience at least once. That’s the thing that makes moshing fun in the first place. I soon saw how crazy it could be when a fully-grown man got knocked to the ground beside my feet, but I soon helped him to his feet and he was back moshing. That’s what makes Velvet Jones special. You feel the community atmosphere and when a band as charismatic as The Regrettes performs, the audience will have an amazing time. I asked bassist Sage Nicole after the show how the band is able to transfer their energy to the audience so well and she said, “It’s something that came naturally, really. Once we got more used to performing, we’ve tried to play it up.”</p>\n<p>You might think from my description of the show that The Regrettes is a band of veteran rockers, but you would be wrong. None of them are even seniors in high school. That is what is perhaps most exciting about The Regrettes. They aren’t just a high school rock band, they are a fully fledged, intensely energetic band with hard-hitting punk songs and a nostalgic pop-appeal that also happen to be teenagers. As I travelled back home covered in sweat not entirely my own, I knew that all of us in that mosh pit that night had experienced something special.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77375\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77375\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/","id":6809,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6808,6807,6806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes","biography":"Not available","articles":[134,976,1365,5769,6148,6684,6708,6735,6770,6782,6789,6792,6809,6827],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Friday Review: Playboi Carti by Playboi Carti","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/playboi-carti-interscope-records.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/playboi-carti-interscope-records.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"If Frank Ocean can indulge in Carti’s sound guilt-free, anyone can be driven to the pleasure-filled land of production excellency, designer brands and jewelry pieces found on Carti’s tape.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In New York, I milly rock, hide it in my sock,” a line off Playboi Carti’s latest single, “Magnolia,” has probably weaseled its way onto your Twitter timeline, accompanied by a group of industrial goths dancing under a bridge. Playboi Carti, a frontrunner for the 2017 XXL Freshman List and A$AP Mob affiliate, released his self-titled mixtape last week, propelling Carti Season into full force. Influenced by the South Atlanta rap scene in which Gucci Mane reigned supreme, Playboi Carti provides his dose of charisma through his heavily anticipated 15-track mixtape.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carti’s musical catalog before his debut project was fairly limited. He only dropped a couple of features and hits, and the idea of a cohesive project reached mythical proportions. Soundcloud has provided a medium for the new wave of VLONE-clad rappers to gain cult fanatical status, as their songs become the emblematic hype anthems for car rides and parties around the world. If you are looking for a rapper to give you a concept album sprinkled with samples and conscious messages about our society, head to Kendrick and Joey Bada$$’s latest albums — as Playboi Carti will not give you the same plethora of confounding statements. When one listens to Carti, they don’t listen to find groundbreaking thematic revelations or witty metaphors hidden within his lyrics. Rather, they listen for the progressive beats and Carti’s earworm tracks that ease their way into the listener’s mentality.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The producer masterminds behind Carti’s project are Pierre Bourne, Harry Fraud, Southside, Ricci Riera and Roark Baily — all are part of the group of unsung heroes behind your favorite Soundcloud rappers. Twenty-three-year-old Bourne is credited for six songs on the tape, implementing his audio engineering magic to illuminate the catchy singles “wokeuplikethis” and “Magnolia.” As for Carti’s narrative contents, you can expect to find hints of exemplary fashion advice like rocking Ksubi jeans, Alexander McQueen and Rick Owens. Carti grants opportunities for his fellow Raf Simons consumers to display their talents, as illustrated by the captivating track “New Choppa,” where A$AP Rocky delivers his smooth cadence when rapping about his fast Adidas. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduation from the “Broke Boi” rapper who was still working retail at H&amp;M while dropping songs on Soundcloud to the Carti that is selective on the ice he buys is evident throughout the tracklisting. The infectious bassline that pounds in the stellar banger, “Magnolia,” takes the listener on an excursion into Carti’s lifestyle. Two lively collaborations containing muffled keyboard melodies with Lil Uzi Vert — “wokeuplikethis” and “Lookin” — have well over 20 million plays on Soundcloud and have designated spots on everyone’s pre-game playlists. The closest Carti gets to lamenting is when he raps about his reliance on Xanax in “Let It Go,” likening the drug to a controlling force of his life. The juxtaposition in Carti’s tape is that it is often categorized in the last tier of what purist rap consumers would ever find compelling, but it is merely impossible not to start shimmying your shoulders like Lil Uzi Vert and replicating Carti’s occasional ad-libs. Attempting to not like Carti is similar to trying not to eat all your McDonald’s fries while you’re driving home. You will eventually cave into temptation and find yourself  humming along to his beats, despite your self-containment to never associate with “hypebeast music.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite trap music being a means of pure entertainment rather than contributing exceptional social commentary, Carti’s music could use some improvement. However, this will all come in time, since, again, he is only 20 years old. In a future follow-up, Carti can provide more of an auditory variance in flow delivery and experiment with versatile lyrics, allowing him to be more engaging rather than remaining repetitive throughout a whole project. Frank Ocean, everyone’s favorite singer, has collaborated with Carti on an unreleased track which may never get to bless the ears of the public. In the words of Carti himself, “We made a song and it was very lit, I don’t know if the world’s going to get it, though.” If Frank Ocean can indulge in Carti’s sound guilt-free, anyone can be driven to the pleasure-filled land of production excellency, designer brands and jewelry pieces found on Carti’s tape. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/","id":6806,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6805,6804,6803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Drunk by Thundercat","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-03-at-2.57.32-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-03-at-2.57.32-PM.png?resize=980%2C630&ssl=1","description":"On Thundercat’s whimsical cacophonic trek through the land of Drunk, he has had a little too much liquid courage and finally lets out the thoughts that a sober self pushes to the back confines of th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Thundercat’s recent full-length studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may seem like the first that a large-scale audience will truly hear of him, a quick look at music’s recent trends will prove otherwise. Electro-jazz bass talent Stephen Bruner, better known as Thundercat, and his collective label Brainfeeder, has been a powerful influence on the modern hip-hop and R&amp;B scene for quite some time now. Bruner and his mastermind collaborator, Flying Lotus, were major producers for Kendrick Lamar’s earth-shattering masterpiece </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Pimp a Butterfly,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Thundercat himself has added his colorful production to many important artists, such as Mac Miller, Childish Gambino and even the iconic Miss Erykah Badu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, there has been a gradual push in hip-hop and R&amp;B toward a more melodic, jazz-influenced sound and Thundercat has been a steady force. One listen to this vibrant and beautifully disorienting odyssey that is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and this push becomes overwhelmingly apparent. This record, however, is monumental for Bruner, as he is finally stepping out from behind the curtain and taking center stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I stated before, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an odyssey if music has ever heard one. It begins appropriately with opening track “Rabbot Ho,” and then continues to descend into a conceptual drunk madness. The album begins as most wild nights do, upbeat and light, then progresses as the substance seeps in, bringing out darker thoughts and emotions only to end with tracks “3AM,” “Drunk,” “The Turn Down” and “DUI.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying Lotus is an extremely present voice on this project, as the track list shows him featuring on eight of the23 songs. Although the whole album rings with his abstract and lucid approach, the project does not lack individuality. There is a clear and distinct Thundercat sound throughout. His production is solid and diverse, whether it be his vintage bass walk on cult hit “Them Changes,” the surreal electronic drive of “Friend Zone” or the smooth instrumental groove of “Jethro.” This impressive musical effort keeps listeners engaged throughout and provides a fresh and new sound to the music community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The colorful production that moves this album is also equally matched by a very clean and strong vocal performance from Bruner. His voice is a smooth glowing entity that is wonderfully unique to his work. The melodies he creates are a perfect match for his production: distinct, different and jazzy. The work showcases a few features as well such as Pharrell Williams, jazz icon Kenny Loggins and the legendary rap prodigy Kendrick Lamar. These artists specifically are no strangers to this wave of music that Thundercat has engineered and add their own influence effortlessly on their respective tracks. The one sore thumb on the ballot, however, comes at the hands of weed-glorifying master of mediocrity, Wiz Khalifa. As Khalifa is not exactly what you would call an acclaimed music artist, he seems a bit out of place on the track “Drink Dat.” Despite this apparent setback, it hardly halts the strong track and it is thoroughly surrounded by excellence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another X factor on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the unique comedic twist that Bruner has incorporated into his lyrics. Whether it’s his painfully honest claim to “beat your meat, go to sleep,” his “Dragon Ball Z” references or his literal meowing over the track “A Fan’s Mail,” the weird quirky sneak peak into Thundercat’s life makes for honest lyricism and a comedic talent similar to that of singer-songwriter Father John Misty. Once again, we can observe great cohesiveness as his odd twist in his words accents his unique production eloquently</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these quirks that make the album true to Bruner, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is at the end of the day a thematic existential crisis that shows an artist struggling, asking questions and answering them simultaneously. Thundercat’s lyrics continually show him contemplating death, the fleeting construct of time, madness, love, police brutality and everything in between. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s title track near the album’s close shows our hero on the negative side of the substance-use spectrum, pleading that “I’m drowning away all of the pain till I’m totally numb, sometimes you want to feel alive, but not on someone else’s time.” Painfully honest statements like these along with little nuggets such as “It’s okay to disconnect sometimes,” makes this album a profound and moving work to go through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an age old saying, especially prominent in the college setting, that goes along the lines of this: “Drunk statements are just sober thoughts.” On Thundercat’s whimsical cacophonic trek through the land of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he has had a little too much liquid courage and finally lets out the thoughts that a sober self pushes to the back confines of the mind. This album is intelligently and elegantly drunk, and at it’s best moments, even wasted, in every sense of the word. It is eccentric, cringeworthy, silly, sad and, most of all, honest. Drunk hits home with its ability to be all of these extreme things and still remain alarmingly relatable to all who listen. Although surely we are not all similar to the mastermind that is Stephen Bruner, we now know that we are struggling with similar staggering, crippling, sloppy drunk issues. It is these issues and Thundercat’s complex dance with them that makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of the most compelling musical quests of the year thus far.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/","id":6807,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6806,6805,6804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Olés Return to Isla Vista","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Finals season is fast approaching, and what better way to end a grim Winter Quarter than with an astounding show from Isla Vista’s very own The Olés.

The recently graduated Olés have acquired their own enticing twist on reggae and hip hop supplemented with some classic rock. The combination is typically hard to pull off, but it proves to not be a great challenge for this band. The Olés are not only verified on Spotify, but they have an overwhelming amount of supporters across the state of California. Aside from their numerous fan base, their music speaks for itself in a very humble form of musical complexity. Their California roots run deep; it is apparent in their sound, and it is what gives them the edge that most bands seek: a mixture of soft vocals and electric melodies that no other band could match. This is what drove a number of I.V. natives to jump at the chance to see them in action.<br>\nAfter recently embarking on their Southern California tour, members Matt Tweed, Cole Leksan, Daniel Kearney, Eric Lordan, Nicholas Marks, Dominick Burham and Westin Byerly made their return to the town of I.V. and were welcomed back with open arms. A Facebook invite created for the event went out before the show, and its attendees totaled nearly 1,000 people for this long-awaited concert. The buzz surrounding the show via word of mouth was immense compared to the typical talk of an Isla Vista concert or party. It is not rare for people to just come across a band they had not been anticipating in Isla Vista, but for The Olés, there was little promotion that had to be done because all of their fans were doing it for them. In the days approaching the show, it was not uncommon to be asked, “Hey, are you seeing The Olés this weekend?” or, “Yes, I saw the Facebook invite; I am definitely going!” The closer it came to the day of the show, the more the anticipation increased to finally see the band that everyone and their mother could not stop talking about.<br>\nThe show lineup included sets from Atomic Walrus, Zeek Beats &amp; Caleto and, finally, The Olés. Sueno, and of course Isla Vista in its entirety, filled with the upbeat, radiant sounds of the band that we all came to see. Like any other Saturday night, you saw drunk people flinging their limbs in rhythms they hoped came off as dancing. Everyone was in sync with each other, and while their love for The Olés poured out of their hearts and lungs, the band reciprocated the feelings by giving their all to their performance. Whether it was the fact that the guys were incredibly in tune with each other or the fact that they were playing in the heart of the town they had a great amount of love for, it was one of the most emotional performances that an Isla Vistan could experience and the band would have the opportunity to play. Sober or not, there is no forgetting the union of the glowing lights with the gray smoke in the cold night that enhanced every chord and every vocal melody. Although nothing could beat seeing them where it all began, The Olés are stopping by Velvet Jones and a few other local venues, and it would be an understatement to say that they are worth checking out. Do yourself a favor and catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/","id":6808,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6807,6806,6805],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
