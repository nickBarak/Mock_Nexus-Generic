Taking all that into consideration, it’s no wonder why the Cardinals were favored to take out a young Gaucho team. However, UCSB was not fazed by the team on the other side of the field, nor the crowd, which peaked at 4634, that cheered them on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to notable performances from star junior pitcher Shane Bieber and big-time sophomore hitter Austin Bush, Santa Barbara was able to steal game one from Louisville and is now one win away from reaching its first-ever College World Series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The home team got on the board first after sophomore third baseman Blake Tiberi hit a solo shot homer to right field to lead off the second inning to make the score 1-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were able to retaliate and tie the game up at one after sophomore Clay Fisher hit a RBI double to score senior third baseman Ryan Clark. The shortstop had another solid outing going 2-4 (.500) with one RBI to continue his postseason success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of success, if there is one player who is truly enjoying major success this postseason at the plate, a strong argument could be made that the player is Austin Bush. The sophomore gave his team a 2-1 lead after hitting a home run for the fourth consecutive postseason game. It was Bush’s 11th homer of the season as he also went 2-4 (.500), with one RBI and one run scored on the day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An RBI double from sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier would extend the Gauchos lead to 3-1 after four innings of play. UCSB would add another run in the fifth inning to net a 4-1 lead after sophomore second baseman JJ Muno, who also went 2-4 (.500) with one RBI and one run scored, hit an RBI single right up the middle to score Bush.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After allowing the home run in the second inning, Bieber stepped up allowing only four hits while striking out two batters in the third, fourth and fifth inning. The Cardinals would finally strike in the sixth however, as Tiberi scored his second run off Bieber thanks to an RBI single to center field to make the score 4-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After closing out the seventh inning in one-two-three fashion, Bieber was relieved by sophomore Kyle Nelson. The junior had a great game allowing only eight hits and two runs while striking out seven batters to pick up his 12th win of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson picked up the save and secured victory for his team again in this postseason after pitching a perfect final two innings allowing no hits and no runs while striking out one batter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could easily make the case that this win over Louisville might be one of the biggest in program history. Not only did UCSB defeat a top-two team in the nation in a place that it had only lost once before, but it now moved within one win of reaching its first College World Series.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Louisville has only lost back-to-back games twice this season, and will be pitching the 2016 ACC Pitcher of the Year, junior Drew Harrington in order to win tomorrow’s match and force a game three that would be played on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB now faces a similar situation it was in just one week prior: it is in control of its own destiny. The Gauchos have the upper-hand on the No. 2 team in the country, and while it wont be easy to put a team away on the road, they have proven themselves capable of doing so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has yet to lose a postseason game this year, and chances are the players, coaches and fans want it to stay that way at least until tomorrow’s match is over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos next game will be against Louisville in game two of a best of three series at Jim Patterson Stadium on Sunday, June 12 at 9 a.m. PDT. The game will be televised live on ESPN 2 while also being streamed on the WatchESPN app.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Aug. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Restorative justice is an approach to justice that… identifies the harm that is done, how can that harm be repaired and who is responsible,” Camarena said, adding that the purpose of such a program is to “strengthen ties between law enforcement and the community they serve.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Isla Vista resident who violates specific Santa Barbara County ordinances – ordinance 36-2: consuming alcohol in public; 36-3: having an open container or 40-2: playing loud music outside of curfew hours – will now have the option of attending a two-hour educational workshop and completing four hours of community service instead of paying a fine. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating these ordinances can cost a maximum of $100 for first violation, $200 for the second violation and $500 for each additional violation that occurs within that same year, Camarena explained. </span></p>\n<p>Foot Patrol Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder added that there are additional court processing and court security fees that can add anywhere from $40 to $100 to the initial fine.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the workshops, individuals will be educated about the section they violated, how that violation affected the community around them and why the ordinance was created in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workshops will be operated by the sheriff’s office, the I.V. CSD, UCSB student organizations and long-term I.V. residents, Camarena said. The program also hopes to also partner with Santa Barbara City College to hold the workshops, as many students who attend the city college also choose to live in I.V., he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if residents choose the workshop and community service route, the violation won’t appear on their permanent record, Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We want] education of the actual violation,” Camarena said, citing the loud music ordinance that prohibits amplified music past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. “[The program] would go into more details of [what it means] to disturb someone’s peace.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also stated there would be an attempt on law enforcement’s part to reach out to the offenders and to ask feedback questions during the workshops, such as “How can we solve this problem that we have here? What things can we share with the community to prevent these types of violations?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the community service branch of the program, offenders will primarily work with the I.V. Recreation and Park District and the I.V. CSD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The program] will educate the offenders of the consequences of their actions… I believe it will build trust and legitimacy in policing, it will give [law enforcement] an opportunity to reach out to the community and for the community to really understand law enforcement,” Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not just us versus them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD endorsed the program at its Aug. 27 meeting, with Board President Spencer Brandt welcoming the attempt at offering alternative punishments for violations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education is always gonna go so much further than a slap-on-the-wrist approach,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [3:26 p.m.]: This article was updated to include further information from Schroeder and Camarena. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Washington will play the loser match tomorrow, and if it loses that game then it will be eliminated from the tournament. If it wins, it will continue on in the Regionals.</p>\n<p>The game itself was a testament to how truly great sports are — college sports in particular — when you see these young athletes fight for their playoff lives with all their might.</p>\n<p>More specifically, it was impressive to see the young Gaucho team continue to battle back.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the bottom of the third inning when redshirt junior Devon Gradford hit an RBI single to center field to make the score 1-0. The play was controversial as the Huskies center fielder, junior Jack Meggs, ran up and made what he deemed to be a diving catch for an out. The umpire ruled that the defender did not catch it; therefore, the hit counted as well as the run.</p>\n<p>Washington retaliated in the top of the fourth as sophomore catcher Joey Morgan flied flew out to right field where Gradford made the catch and tried to throw out junior infielder Chris Baker, who was a bit too quick, and was able to tie the game at one.</p>\n<p>For the next seven innings, both teams went scoreless thanks to tremendous pitching on both sides, especially by Husky starting pitcher sophomore Noah Bremerok who after allowing one run, retired the last 19 batters he faced.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber went 7.1 innings for Santa Barbara, allowing only eight hits and one earned run. Star reliever and redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson came in afterward and did solid pitching for four innings and allowed no hits, one run and struck out a career-high seven batters.</p>\n<p>Hope seemed lost for the Gauchos in the 12th as an error put runners on first and third for the Huskies with no outs. Eventually, Washington loaded the bases with two outs and scored on a walk to take a 2-1 lead before redshirt junior Trevor Bettencourt retired the side.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded in the bottom half of the inning courtesy of Gradford who hit a leadoff home run to begin the inning. It was the first of the season, and it was a special moment for a player who was not even sure he going to make the roster in the fall, but is possibly his team’s current savior.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Hero.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Austin Bush ends it in the 14th! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadToOmaha?src=hash\">#RoadToOmaha</a><a href=\"https://t.co/UszjOY9ijQ\">https://t.co/UszjOY9ijQ</a></p>\n<p>— NCAA Baseball (@NCAACWS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAACWS/status/738882720424546304\">June 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>After that, the teams again traded scoreless innings until the defining moment. Sophomore designated hitter Austin Bush hit another leadoff home run — this time in the walk-off variety — blasting his team to the winners match with a 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>It was a game that truly encompassed the beauty of baseball and college sports as a whole. It was great to see both teams fight the way they did. For the Gauchos, it was amazing seeing the resilience of the team yet again shine through in possibly the most important game of their season so far.</p>\n<p>Either way, after such an emotional win, it will be important for Santa Barbara to recover fast for tomorrow’s match, which is slated to begin at 6 p.m. PDT. Whether it faces the defending NCAA runners-up in Vanderbilt, the hosts of the tournament, or Xavier, who has won 16 of its last 18, UCSB will need to be ready after having to use three arms from the bullpen and the other players playing fourteen grueling innings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face off against either Xavier or Vanderbilt in the second round of the Nashville Regional Double Elimination Tournament at Hawkins Field on Saturday, June 4 at 6 p.m. PDT. The game will also be streamed on <em>ESPN3.com</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Our hearts and condolences are with Vanderbilt and their baseball team as well as the family of Commodores pitcher Donny Everett who lost his life at age 19 after a tragic drowning accident. Vanderbilt could have pushed the tournament back, but instead decided to play in his honor, and for that we are thankful and hope the best for everyone who was blessed to know Everett. May he rest in peace, and good luck to Vanderbilt in the tourney.</em></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Vanderbilt-Xavier match-up has been pushed to tomorrow at 11 a.m. PDT due to raining conditions. The winners match is expected to still begin at the same time.</em></p>\n<p><em>Update: Xavier defeated Vanderbilt on Saturday and in the losers’ match between Vandy-Washington, Vanderbilt lost again eliminating them from the tournament. UCSB-Xavier will play on Sunday at 12 p.m. PST after another rain delay pushed the game back from its original time. The loser of that match will play Washington at 6 p.m. PST.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Xavier falls to 31-29 on the season, and the loss also stops its previous seven-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the start that UCSB was ready to play the winners’ match, especially after the weather conditions delayed the game until today. The Gauchos started the game with three runs in the first inning to take an early, commanding 3-0 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher had a great game, batting 3-4 (.750) on the evening with three RBI, including one scoring redshirt junior Andrew Calica off a triple hit to left field. The California native was a homerun shy of hitting the cycle.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter Austin Bush went yard yet again in this postseason, hitting his ninth home run of the season — second of the Regionals — for the final score of the first inning. It would be Bush’s only hit of the day, but it certainly was a huge one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added to their lead in the fourth inning thanks to two lead off singles by senior third baseman Ryan Clark and sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier. After a sac bunt by Calica to put both runners in scoring position, Fisher hit a double to center field, scoring both runners and extending the lead to 5-0.</p>\n<p>Xavier responded by scoring two runs in the bottom half of the fourth courtesy of RBI singles from sophomore Nate Soria and Will LaRue to cut the lead back to only three runs.</p>\n<p>Although the Musketeers were down by three runs, designated hitter David Morton did not want to give up on his senior campaign so easily. The senior had a great day, going 3 for 4 with two RBI and a triple shy of the cycle while also trying his career high in hits for a single season.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning, the Ohio native hit a home run to make the score 5-3. In the sixth frame, Morton again did damage on the scoreboard, hitting an RBI single to midfield to cut the lead to just one run at 5-4.</p>\n<p>The senior’s play certainly helped rally his team back, but his and his team’s effort would come up short as the Gauchos would not allow a single run the rest of the way and only surrendered two hits.</p>\n<p>It was another senior — this time on the UCSB side —who put away Xavier for good. Right-hander Justin Kelly pitched an amazing final 2.2 innings to pick up his first save of the season. The redshirt senior allowed only one hit while striking out seven of the eight batters he faced on the evening. In the ninth and final frame, Kelly struck out all three batters in succession to secure the victory and send his team to the Regional Championship.</p>\n<p>With a victory in the title match, the Gauchos would reach the Super Regionals for the first time in program history and would face Louisville, who won the Louisville Regional by defeating all three of its opponents in succession by an average margin of 6.3 runs.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face the winner of the Xavier-Washington match while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The winner of the elimination bracket would then have to defeat the Gauchos twice in order to advance to the Super Regionals, while the Gauchos only have to win once.</p>\n<p>This certainly seems like the dream scenario Head Coach Andrew Checketts and the team wanted when it found out it made the NCAA regionals. The Gauchos are currently in control of their own destiny, and, this late in the season, that is a victory in and of itself.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB has two chances to win one game and advance, it would certainly be ideal to win the first game in order to have more time to prepare for a very tough Louisville team.</p>\n<p>Either way, this Regional will end on Monday — unless there are more weather delays — in either happiness or sheer disappointment for Santa Barbara. The former would definitely be the more optimal choice for the team in control of its destiny.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face off against either Xavier or Washington in the Nashville Regional Championship at Hawkins Field on Monday, June 6 at 12 p.m. PDT. The game will also be streamed live on <em>ESPN3.com</em>. If UCSB fails to win the first match, then a second game will take place in a winner-takes-all fashion between the same two teams at 6 p.m. PDT to determine who will advance to the Super Regionals.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
