The Senate also accepted Off-Campus Senator Cory Wheeler’s resignation and decided who would be responsible for finding his replacement.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Andrew Soriano proposed post-Hurricane Sandy clean-up efforts, emphasizing the gravity of the disastrous situation and citing similar fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>“The hurricane pretty much devastated the East Coast,” Soriano said. “I know in the past we have organized efforts with things like Hurricane Katrina.”</p>\n<p>Soriano’s idea was met with support and enthusiasm. Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia suggested a blood drive to help aide shortages in areas heavily affected by the storm.</p>\n<p>“There has been a blood shortage because of so many people being wounded … blood banks have been affected as well,” Segovia said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Segovia also encouraged a partnership with Red Cross to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Miya Sommers said the United States was not the only country to take a beating from Sandy, reminding the Senate that some other affected countries do not have the infrastructure to bounce back quickly after such a storm.</p>\n<p>Another proposed project dealt with Isla Vista’s lack of appropriate lighting. Off-Campus Senators Alex Choate and Kaitlyn Christianson are working on a resolution to make I.V. brighter, which they defended at the meeting. Christianson said the resolution, which entails filing a work order for each defunct bulb in I.V., is a simple solution to a pressing issue.</p>\n<p>“[This is] something that we’ve needed for years and it [has] not [been] able to get done because of funding,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Senators discussed Proposition 30 and the consequences that would accompany its failure, as they have at every meeting for the past few weeks. There will be continued efforts to advocate Proposition 30’s significance to the student body before Tuesday’s election.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/","id":3102,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3101,3100,3099],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Election Bill Veto Sparks Controversy in A.S.

President Harrison Weber’s veto of the organization’s amended Elections Code.</p>\n<p>Weber struck the bill down after the representatives unanimously voted in its favor last week on the grounds that many of its provisions — such as a ban on A.S. officials’ candidate endorsements — violated First Amendment rights. The committee modifies the code every year to ensure fair and equitable campaigning for students interested in running in elections during Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Weber, campus legal counsel Nancy G. Hamill also flagged certain legal ramifications in the new Elections Code that could potentially face legal challenge if the veto is overridden.</p>\n<p>“I did not want to do a veto, [and] I believe a veto should not be thrown around like it’s not a big deal,” Weber said. “But things like the Elections Committee exist for a reason — and the veto exists for a reason, and I felt there were some things that really needed to be addressed.”</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Elections Committee Chair Courtney Axner said the council supports an override of the veto without further alterations by a two-thirds vote of the council.</p>\n<p>“We support him fully, and I think he is a great President, [but] in all honesty we’re just … trying to work the process out,” Axner said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the ban unnecessarily prevents officials from favoring candidates, Weber said.</p>\n<p>“The endorsement question does not have any legitimate educational purpose because students are only told what certain officials think of candidates,” Weber said. “Student-Advocate General endorsements are only as good as the credibility behind the endorsement. It is not just like a rubber stamp that says: you got my endorsement, you got the position.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, the endorsements help prevent the election of “an outside person without any regulation [who] can do damage to the office and the services it provides.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Marlene Moreno said biased endorsements may sway voters and create an unequal arena for candidates without connections in the association.</p>\n<p>“[The] Student Advocate General should not be able to endorse views because [Weber] has a very idealistic view that a hundred percent of the students will know what a Student General does,” Moreno said. “I have faith in students but people will take titles at face value.”</p>\n<p>Weber also requested the committee clarify its ambiguous definition of “defamation” and what constitutes “offensive or inappropriate” language as well as re-evaluate its restriction of the campaigning period to two weeks due to its possible limitation on free speech.</p>\n<p>However, Axner said candidates’ unique position as students and politicians requires extra consideration.</p>\n<p>“Nationally, presidents can campaign whenever they want, but our concern is that we are students first before we are any elected position,” Axner said. “By [establishing a] limited two-week period of campaigning, it gives students ample time to say ‘I’m a student first, and then the two weeks I’m going to work really hard for the position I want.’”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nate Walker said the Council should take Weber’s recommendations into consideration to avoid placing itself in a legal dispute.</p>\n<p>“I trust that if we make rational amendments to the bill that are in the interest in the students, Harrison will not veto it again,” Walker said. “We let the veto go through, we put this in old-business, we make all amendments and add in the Elections Code verbiage.”</p>\n<p>The issue remained unresolved as of press time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Though Student Regent-designate Cinthia Flores was origi- nally scheduled to attend, she was unable to make an appear- ance due to scheduling conflicts.</p>\n<p>Stein, a UC Berkeley graduate student who is working toward a law degree and a master’s degree in public policy, said the event’s goal was to encourage students to become more involved in and informed about the decisions made at local, statewide and national levels with regard to UC policies.</p>\n<p>“First and foremost, I give voice to student concerns at the highest level of UC administration … I empower students to solve their own problems,” Stein said. “We have to engage our administrators, and what that means is that Student Regents are one part of a much larger student movement that is sort of attacking from all angles.”</p>\n<p>Stein said while protest is often an effective method of communicating with the board, much more is needed to fully engage the administrators and promote widespread change. Some potential ways to take a more noticeable stance include holding advocacy protests on several campuses and lobbying at regents’ meetings, Stein said.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Sophia Armen, it is crucial that students recognize their voice on the Board of Regents and work for further representation in committees that allocate large amounts of funding and other resources to the university.</p>\n<p>“It is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of education that we as students in the UC, who number over 200,000, only have one student vote on the Board of Regents that raise our fees and affect our daily lives,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>Stein said Prop. 30 was a huge victory for students, but only a temporary solution for the coming cuts to the UC system. According to Stein, students must re-involve themselves in advocacy efforts for the upcoming 2013-14 year and any future year in order to avoid huge tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>“As a result, students have to go back to Sacramento to begin the process of lobbying for another tuition buyout,” Stein said. “We passed Prop. 30 through student voter registration and student voter turnout … now we have to go back and lobby to negate a tuition increase for the second year in a row.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, ensuring the transparent use of funds generated through Prop. 30 is one of many causes that contrib- ute to the importance of “fighting for our right to education as a public good.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science major Sydney Bennet, a campus organizing director for the A.S. External Vice President of Student Affairs, said students need to take action by getting involved with campaigns that speak directly to California legislators and create more opportunities to lobby in support of education.</p>\n<p>“We represent students on statewide, national and UC level, and our goal is to make sure education remains afford- able and accessible,” Bennet said. “This [event] was just the first step.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of November 19th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/","id":3100,"author":{"id":203,"name":"Jennifer Chang"},"related":[3099,3098,3097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Each brigade disperses medical supplies to a village until replaced by the next brigade the following month.</p>\n<p>This year’s UCSB dispatch will take place June 17 to 27 and focus on two different communities in Ghana’s Abuakwa region.</p>\n<p>UCSB GMB Treasurer Paola Cardenas, a fourth-year biology major, said $2,000 of the student funds would supply malaria medication and the rest would finance other medication including painkillers, antibiotics and vitamins, while participants would personally cover all other travel costs.</p>\n<p>“Everything comes out of our own pockets including airfare … this is a complete volunteer trip,” Cardenas said. “It’s not just a group of kids going on a vacation … It’s a group of kids going to help people [and] to make lives better.”</p>\n<p>The 10-day trip includes medication distribution, patient consultation, door-to-door greetings and a public health day educating local communities about water filtration systems and the importance of sanitation.</p>\n<p>GMB Vice President of Fundraising Steven Tilem, a fourth-year microbiology major, said the local chapter is being given the honor of representing the U.S. as one of the first groups involved in the new Ghana program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is one of the lucky few United States programs that has the opportunity to be a foundation for this new community,” Tilem said. “It is a great opportunity, and it is all based on the fact that we have a great reputation not only with excellent funding and support from our school and community, but because of the dedication of students and UCSB in general.”</p>\n<p>GMB President Jamie Miller, a fourth-year biology major, said the club ultimately seeks to better the living standards in the Ghanaian communities.</p>\n<p>“Our primary goal is to go to these communities that do not have adequate access to health care,” Miller said. “In Ghana, we will organize medications to distribute and go door-to-door to identify problems so that we can [ultimately] prevent them.”</p>\n<p>The board fully funded the group in the amount of $4,625 with the stipulation that it host an A.S. awareness event.</p>\n<p>According to Cardenas, all students can apply to participate in UCSB’s Global Medical Brigades. Last fall, 40 students were selected to go on the Ghana trip.</p>\n<p>In addition, 15 local healthcare professionals traveled to Ghana, including UCSB faculty member and alumnus Dr. Jason Prystowsky.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/","id":3101,"author":{"id":201,"name":"Christine Cha"},"related":[3100,3099,3098],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
