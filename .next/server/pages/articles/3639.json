About $2.429 billion would come from changing the income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, $1.72 billion from eliminating Public Service Loan Forgiveness and $1.5 billion from eliminating subsidized loans, according to data from the Trump Administration.</p>\n<p>Currently, the government pays interest on subsidized student loans while students are in school or the loans are in deferment. If the changes in the new budget are enacted, the federal government would only offer unsubsidized loans.</p>\n<p>The budget suggests “streamlining”  IDR plans for student loans and altering the cap on the percentage of income for these plans and the length of payment.</p>\n<p>Currently there are several IDR plans dependant on income.</p>\n<p>Under the suggestions laid out in the budget, repayment would be capped at 12.5 percent of discretionary income, and balances would be forgiven after 15 years of repayment for undergraduates and after 30 years for graduate students.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes would “focus assistance on needy undergraduate student borrowers instead of high-income, high-balance graduate borrowers.”</p>\n<p>These new conditions would apply only to students borrowing loans beginning July 1, 2019, and would not apply to students who are already using student loans from the federal government.</p>\n<p>The budget also encourages Congress to pass a law that would make colleges and universities assume some of the financial risk associated with student loans.</p>\n<p>The budget also suggests changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) and CalFresh, which is California’s version of the program. A portion of the monetary benefits that program recipients currently receive would be replaced with a box of food.</p>\n<p>Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), compared the proposed program to Blue Apron, the meal delivery service, at a press briefing.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney said it would cause “tremendous” cost savings.</p>\n<p>“It lowers the cost to us because we can buy prices at wholesale, whereas they have to buy it at retail. It also makes sure that they’re getting nutritious food,” he said.</p>\n<p>The reforms to S.N.A.P. would save about $17 billion, according to numbers the OMB produced.</p>\n<p>UCSB students who receive benefits from CalFresh would be impacted by the proposed changes.</p>\n<p>Rodolfo Herrera, the coordinator of the A.S. Food Bank, said the average student at UCSB receiving CalFresh benefits received about $150 per month.  He noted, however, that the amount students receive varies significantly.</p>\n<p>He added that international and undocumented students are not able to receive these benefits.</p>\n<p>He said the freedom of students to purchase foods from CalFresh is “really important” because recipients can use it to buy foods that don’t require a lot of cooking or processing, which he noted would matter especially to students preparing for finals or midterms.</p>\n<p>According to data provided by Herrera, CalFresh sales at the Isla Vista Food Co-op totalled $52,930 in 2015 and $68,000 in 2016.</p>\n<p>Herrera said the logistics of implementing Trump’s proposed program would be difficult, including storing large quantities of food and even keeping up with people’s addresses.</p>\n<p>“The big system programs that we have for supplemental nutrition for low-income families have been established for a few decades already. The logistical aspects of it are already in place,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.

Foot said Thanksgiving is her favorite holiday because it is one of the few occasions in which her family can “appreciate the differences” and celebrate the “beauty” behind the different cultures involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My mom’s side of the family will make seafood like crawfish and crab or clams and oysters … and my dad’s side of the family makes tamales or enchiladas,” Foot said. “They truly give thanks this way by being able to come together and embrace one another and their differences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foot said Thanksgiving reminds her of being “enveloped in a blanket.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re enveloped in this total complete warmth, and it’s comforting, and it’s safe and it’s beautiful,” Foot said. “It’s home.

race and income are indicators of success on the test. </span><em>Breana Lepe / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano is joining a growing group of UC leaders — including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive — who are advocating for the elimination of the ACT and SAT in admissions. As the idea gained traction in recent years, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/18/record-number-colleges-drop-satact-admissions-requirement-amid-growing-disenchantment-with-standardized-tests/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities across the country</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have made testing optional or eliminated it altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the proposal, the ACT and SAT would be optional for two years, with testing requirements eliminated completely for two years after that. Starting in 2025, a “modif[ied] or create[d] test that better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values” will be used, according to the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proposed for the May 21 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC is unable to modify or create a new test in time for California freshmen applicants in 2025, Napolitano recommends that the UC suspend its testing requirements for California students altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommendation specifies that the potential elimination of the ACT and SAT after 2025 only applies to in-state students, and that the UC President will work with the Academic Senate to determine an approach for out-of-state and international students from 2025 onwards. Some potential options include having students take the same assessment as California students or continuing to accept their ACT and SAT scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal follows the UC Academic Senate’s </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comprehensive proposal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, which found that current standardized testing procedures may be a factor in the underrepresentation of minority groups at UC schools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force (STTF) laid out the need for a new testing method, it recommended that the UC continue mandatory testing for now, the opposite of Napolitano’s proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF’s report ultimately concluded that the UC uses standardized tests responsibly and appropriately. Academic Council Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani wrote in an April </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4attach2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">letter to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Academic Council disagreed with that assessment from the STTF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents announced in March that Fall 2021 admissions would be </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“test optional”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the coronavirus pandemic, which Napolitano now recommends be continued until 2022. Those who don’t submit a score will not be put at a disadvantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2023 and 2024, Napolitano recommends that UC admissions be “test blind,” where students can still submit a score, but it would be used for purposes other than selection, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under Napolitano’s proposal, in a sixth-month process beginning in summer 2020 and ending in January 2021, the UC will identify or create a new test by consulting with K-12 educators, test experts, the California State University (CSU) and UC faculty to “construct a test better suited for the needs of UC” for fall 2025 applicants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Napolitano’s recommendation concurs with the STTF to eliminate the SAT Writing test, calling it “an unnecessary time and cost burden for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, one potential option noted by Napolitano is the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF, however, recommended to Napolitano in its report that the UC not use the SBAC test, which they said is aligned to a different set of academic standards than the ACT and SAT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critics of the ACT and SAT argue that race and income are indicators of success on the test, and that inequitable access to test prep prevents low-income students and underrepresented minorities from getting high scores. Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">against the UC to eliminate the tests in admissions, calling the tests biased.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocates of the SAT and ACT </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-03/uc-should-keep-sat-and-act-as-admission-requirements-faculty-report-says\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">argue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is the only way to determine a student’s academic success across the state, as grading systems vastly differ from school to school. They also argue that the test is only one of fourteen factors in admissions — weighed less than high school grades — so changing the test would not make a significant impact on a student’s admission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will discuss standardized testing in their board meeting on May 21, where they will look at Napolitano’s proposal and Academic Senate recommendations and vote on a plan for standardized testing moving forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-76374\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Board of Regents approved a 3.5 percent tuition increase for out-of-state undergraduate students Thursday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents voted 12-3 in favor of the tuition hike, which will add approximately $978 to yearly tuition costs for out-of-state students. The increase will go into effect at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year and is expected to raise $35 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano released a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-board-regents-chair-george-kieffer-and-uc-president-janet-napolitano-gov\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January expressing concerns about receiving less funding than expected from Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget plan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s budget proposal this year proposed only a 3 percent increase in funding allocated to the UC, down from 4 percent in years past. The state government typically increases UC funding to meet the ever-increasing number of enrolled students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been tabling and performing outreach to out of state students on our campus, and we’ve still yet to find anyone with 1,000 extra dollars floating around for next year’s tuition,” Spencer Brandt, UCSB Lobby Corps co-chair, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC admits meeting after meeting that a tuition hike is a band aid solution to a long term problem, caused by 20+ years of gubernatorial and state legislative divestment,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving less state funding than expected, Napolitano said the university is committed to adding an additional 2,000 undergraduate students and 500 graduate students for the fall of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many people who control the higher education committees in the Assembly and the Senate use their platform to score political points against the UC, and President Napolitano,” Brandt said. “Then when we take students to the Capitol to meet with them, they point the finger at the UC. And that’s worked for them for a long time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lobby Corps has a message for those legislators: UCSB students are not stupid,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristin Hsu, the external vice president of statewide affairs, has helped Lobby Corps prepare postcards asking students to “Fund the UC.” The postcards detail students’ demands and concerns and will be delivered to the state legislature at a conference next month, Hsu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What are the UC Regents expecting out of state students to sacrifice to pay for this tuition increase? The answer is physical and mental health, academic success, food and housing security,” Hsu said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, UC students are forced to pay for conflicts and disagreements among UCOP, the UC Regents, and the state legislature that we have no control over. That is an absolute shame,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will vote on an additional 2.7 percent tuition increase for in-state residents in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lobby Corps Internal Director Mayela Morales and other UCSB students attended the public forum of Wednesday’s Regents meeting to protest the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might’ve lost with out-of-state students this time, but we also have the proposed in-state tuition increase coming up in the May Regents meeting,” Morales said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morales said that she plans to lobby representatives in Sacramento to “allocate the sufficient funding to the UC system in order to buy out the tuition hikes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an issue that needs to be targeted through various tactics, but we have to remember that if it has been stopped before, we can do it again,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
