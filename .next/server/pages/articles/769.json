We’re going to come ready and fired up. I’m looking forward to getting back on the court because I know we all have the feeling of … not good.”</p>\n<p>The Big West’s best defense and offense will square off in Saturday’s contest. UCSB allows only 50.7 points per game and holds its opponent to 36.5 percent from the field, also a league best.</p>\n<p>However, while the Gauchos like to slow down the tempo, Pacific wants to score. They average 71.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Pacific’s going to be just more reminders and refreshers on things because they’re like other teams we’ve already faced,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “If we play like we did in the second half [against Davis] and bring that to the first half of Pacific and we have forty (complete) minutes, I’ll feel real good about our chances.”</p>\n<p>Like UC Davis, who found success from behind the arc, Pacific likes the three point shot. The Tigers are second in the Big West in three point field goal percentage.The scoring for Pacific came from multiple players. Three of the top nine scorers in the Big West are Tigers: Erica McKenzie, Ashley Wakefield, and Kendall Rodriguez. The three each average 12 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very athletic team and they’re going to create some problems in some matchups,” Mitchell said. “But if we worry about us, then we’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Pacific takes advantage of their athleticism, which on the defensive end results in steals. The Tigers lead the league in this category.</p>\n<p>The game against the Tigers could also serve as payback for a home loss to UC Davis last night. Despite an ugly first half that left the Gauchos trailing by 18 at halftime, UCSB mounted a comeback that almost succeeded.</p>\n<p>“It was a tale of two halves,” Mitchell said. “Unfortunately the game is for 40 minutes. If we had brought the effort that we brought to the floor in the first half like we did in the second half, we would’ve had a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>A different UCSB team showed up for the second half and immediately took momentum with an 8-0 run. They chipped away at Davis’ lead throughout the final 20 minutes, holding the Aggies to 18 points in the second half, and found themselves down just three with 24 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“Any time you hold a potent scoring team like Davis to 18 in the second half … you’d think you had won the game,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>UCSB was forced to play the fouling game, and lost, as Samantha Meggison converted her free throws down the stretch. Meggison shot 8-10 from the line and finished with 15 points.</p>\n<p>“The kids decided to play and that’s all I can say,” Mitchell said of the comeback. “They wanted to win, but they have to understand that you’re playing great teams and also when you’re at home, you can’t dig yourself into a whole.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers plagued UC Santa Barbara against the tenacious, trapping defense of UC Davis. The Gauchos threw the ball away 21 times.</p>\n<p>The Aggies also killed the Gauchos with treys, especially in the first half, shooting 54.5 percent. UCD leads the league in three pointers per game with 7.3.</p>\n<p>“When one player makes one, the basket seems to get a little bigger,” Mitchell said. “Give them credit because they’re shooters and that’s what they do. But it seemed the second half our hand was there a little bit quicker.”</p>\n<p>Johnson was UCSB’s best player for the night with 13 points, six assists, and three steals. Nesbit also added 11 points. But it was the Aggies’ Hannah Stephens that led all scorers with 16 points, including 4-5 from downtown, although 14 of those points came in the first half.</p>\n<p>“She got that first three and that set the tone, so that’s on me,” Johnson said. “Give credit to Davis because they came out to play the first half. We’re going to put it together and we’re going to continue to fight.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off tomorrow against Pacific is set for 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43985\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43985\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-host-pacific-big-west-tiebreaker/","id":769,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[768,767,766],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Tally Back-to-Back Wins for First Time This Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WBball_vsUCD-170201-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team seems to be reaching its expected potential as it won its second-straight game.

At the start of the second quarter, the home team went bucket-for-bucket with their opponents, but eventually fell short as UCSB went on a striking 6-0 run to put New Mexico State down 19 points with the score being 35-16, Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Shortly before the end of the half, junior forward Baylee Robinson stopped the bleeding of the Gaucho offensive aggression, by scoring a basket for the Aggies with 6:10 remaining in the second quarter. That basket was the last basket of the first half for the home team, though, as New Mexico was outscored 26-6 in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Defense was an immense factor in the game, as UCSB smashed the Aggies on the battle of the boards, outrebounding the home team 47-32. Santa Barbara held their opponents to an 18-point first half, creating the separation they needed to approach the half with a handsome lead.</p>\n<p>It was a 50-18 lead for the visiting team at the half, and the Gauchos made sure not to let the break cool them off, as they went on an 8-0 run to open the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The visitors steamrolled their way into the fourth period, in command of a 39-point deficit with the score sitting at 67-28 in their favor.</p>\n<p>While New Mexico State did manage to ignite their offense, and outscore UCSB 19-10 in the fourth quarter, their resistance to feat was futile as it was simply not enough to overcome their opponents.</p>\n<p>Bench play has proven to be a bright spot for UCSB yet again, as the bench stats were asymmetrical, in favor of Santa Barbara. The bench of the road team outscored the Aggies 32-7.</p>\n<p>Porter led her team in scoring, contributing a booming 17 points, Bates added 11 to the score, and redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman hit her typical double-digit game by sprinkling in 10 points.</p>\n<p>Freshman center Natalia Bruening grabbed a career-high 12 rebounds, while freshman guard Danae Miller dished out six assists, leading the game in dimes. All Gauchos that played in the game got a chance to score a bucket and grab at least one rebound, solidifying their attempt at a balanced attack.</p>\n<p>New Mexico State’s freshman guard Brooke Salas gave her team a much needed 18 points, which was a game high, while her teammate sophomore forward Jasmine Cooper was second in scoring for her team lending 14 points to the score.</p>\n<p>UCSB will open up its Big West Conference journey at home in the Thunderdome, against Long Beach State on Jan, 4 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80338\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80338\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-31/gauchos-tally-back-to-back-wins-for-first-time-this-season/","id":766,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[765,764,763],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB End Non-Conf.

It was clear immediately that the Pioneers didn’t stand much of a chance of pulling off the upset.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held a 21-10 lead just ten minutes into the game, and managed to open up that advantage to 36-18 by halftime. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger led the Gaucho offense with 11 points in those first twenty minutes despite an uncharacteristically poor shooting performance, going 5-12 from the field and 1-5 from three in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t shoot particularly well from the field Saturday night, but that didn’t seem to matter much. The Gauchos shot 44 percent from the field, but were a shaky 26.1 percent from beyond the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Much of UCSB’s first half dominance can be attributed to its mastery of the boards. The Gauchos pulled down 36 first half rebounds to Pacific Union’s 15, with graduate transfer Leland King II leading the way with 11 rebounds in the first half for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty and sophomore guard Christian Terrell also got in on the rebound party, as both players grabbed seven boards in the first 20 minutes. Prior to Saturday’s game, Terrell’s season high for rebounds was seven, set back on Dec. 5 against Nebraska-Omaha.</p>\n<p>None of the Gauchos’ first-half starters played more than five minutes in the second half, but that doesn’t mean the hosts took their feet off the gas pedal. UCSB scored 45 points in the second half alone, and saw every player that entered the game score.</p>\n<p>J.D. Slajchert was one of those players, and the junior forward made the most of his season-high 10 minutes of play. Slajchert scored a season-best six points on 2-for-5 shooting, and knocked down one free throw.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos had nine players finish with at least five points, a balanced offensive attack that was key to their second-half scoring efforts. Heidegger’s 16 points led the way, but King II and Canty weren’t far behind with 10 each, as both players posted a double-double on the night as well.</p>\n<p>Jayson Marquez was Pacific Union’s only player in double-digit points Saturday night, although Rae Hubbard finished one point shy with nine points. Forward Noel Briones led all Pioneers with nine rebounds, third-best across both teams, but a 1-7 night from the field limited him to just two points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to stretch its three-game win streak out a bit more as it enters Big West play on Thursday, Jan. 4 at Cal Poly. The Mustangs are 5-9 on the season, but have a strong 85-82 loss to Cal on their resume.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take Cal Poly on Thursday night at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/","id":767,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[766,765,764],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Overcome by Late Pacific Rally","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team dropped another close game Saturday afternoon at home against University of the Pacific by a score of 52-48.

In the first half alone, the score was tied nine times and there were five lead changes. After halftime, a 6-0 run led by senior forward Kelsey Adrian seemed to give UCSB control over the game.</p>\n<p>However, back-to-back three-pointers down the stretch from Erica McKenzie and Kendall Rodriguez tied up the game with over two minutes remaining. Two more jumpers, one from McKenzie (14 points total), completed a 10-0 run by the Tigers.</p>\n<p>Down 46-50, Adrian fired a shot from downtown that would’ve given life to UCSB, but the shot didn’t go in and Pacific was able to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a wide open look and I should’ve knocked it down,” Adrian said. “When it left my hand I thought it was good, but then it wasn’t.”</p>\n<p>UCSB looked great on paper. The Gauchos outshot Pacific 38.5 percent to 34 percent from the field and kept their turnovers low with just nine, yet struggled with both rebounding and ball control.</p>\n<p>“You can’t expect to win at home when the opposing team gets more free throws and when you’re out-rebounded by a team that’s basically more undersized than we were,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were out-rebounded 39-31 and outscored 11-4 on second chance points, which made a huge difference in such a close game. The exception for UCSB was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who grabbed 12 boards, while also contributing eight points, three assists, two steals and two blocks.</p>\n<p>“We had one player hit the boards and that can’t happen and expect to win,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>The other glaring issue was free throws. Pacific attempted 19 free throws and shot 78.9 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled from the line, shooting 53.3 percent, which is very uncharacteristic of the team that leads the Big West in free throw percentage at 74 percent.</p>\n<p>“[Free throws were] the difference in the game,” Mitchell said. “The free throws are free and if you get up to the free throw line and you’ve worked hard enough to get there, you have to knock them down. That’s a focus thing and that’s a mental toughness part of the game.”</p>\n<p>Every player that stepped on the court for UCSB had at least one basket, with sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit leading the way with 10 points.</p>\n<p>“They were pressing, but we were able to break it a few times and that led to transition baskets,” Adrian said. “We were able to distribute [the ball].”</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to rebound quickly for a nonconference matchup Tuesday on the road against USC.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43999\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43999\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-30/gauchos-overcome-late-pacific-rally/","id":768,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[767,766,765],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
