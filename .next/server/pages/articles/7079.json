His name was Mutlu, and he set the tone for the night with soulful love songs accompanied by rhythmic guitar. A few times he made me giggle, and I blushed from lyrics like “Caramelize me baby / Rub me in nougat from my head to my feet / Caramelize me baby / You know that daddy’s gotta eat.”</p>\n<p>The last few people were just finding their seats as the rest of the crowd anxiously waited in the dark amphitheater when the headliners finally appeared. Daryl Hall took center stage, his platinum feathered hair swept back, revealing sunglasses that he left on for the whole show. Wearing a black button-down shirt with white hemlines and a matching suit jacket, Hall looked pretty snazzy to say the least. To his left stood his counterpart, John Oates, wearing a sleek, all-black ensemble. A funky tune started playing, which I recognized as the intro to the song “Maneater,” and within seconds the crowd was on their feet and waving their arms. After the first song, Hall greeted the crowd with a standard, “Good to see you guys.” He mumbled, “We haven’t been here in a long time,” leading to an indecipherable contemplation with John on exactly how long it’s been. In the end they couldn’t decide.</p>\n<p>The eclectic crowd was composed of everyone from veteran fans to college-aged hipsters, all similarly eager to see Hall &amp; Oates perform. Together they conjured an odor that was the trifecta of weed, beer and the fresh woodsy air from the nature surrounding the stadium. It was my first time at the Santa Barbara Bowl and I was taken aback by its beauty, regularly glancing around to fully take in my surroundings. I happened to spot a middle-aged crew almost get busted by security for lighting a joint. In a way that instance encapsulated the overall vibe for the night. No real binary existed between the old and the young, and in truth the “older” crowd was the rowdiest of the bunch, as if the roles were to be reversed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The seven-piece band consisted of guitar, drums, keyboard, saxophone, chimes, flute and vocals. Having gone to many EDM shows recently, I was very aware that every sound emitted from the stage was made live by the people in front of me. I was careful not to take that fact for granted, since it’s become somewhat of a rarity in what we consider “live” music. Hall’s vocals impressively hit every note attempted, and when mixed with Oates’ voice the outcome was rich and soulful.</p>\n<p>Saxophone player Charles “Mr. Casual” DeChant was a vision in his sterling silver suit, turquoise blue shoes and silver elbow-length hair. I was smitten. His passionate sax solos stole the show on several occasions, most notably during “It Isn’t So,” and an extra loud cheer could be heard throughout the entire stadium whenever he took center stage. Towards the end of the show, Hall traded his guitar for a keyboard during “Do What You Want, Be What You Are.” He played the keyboard with equal parts skill and vivacity, and I noticed lines of people spilling into the front seating area. By the end of the song, a mass of fans surrounded the stage, swaying in unison.</p>\n<p>Hall &amp; Oates left the stage prematurely at approximately 9:10 p.m., but came back out to appease screaming fans. They didn’t disappoint with two of their most famous hits: “Rich Girl” and “You Make My Dreams Come True.” When the lights went out a second time, the insatiable and inebriated audience was still not satisfied and a sizeable crowd pooled at the edge of the stage.</p>\n<p>The duo returned with another banger, “Kiss on My List,” and the show ended when Hall thanked the crowd for coming out. He also made sure to call attention to his TV show, “Live From Daryl’s House,” which features himself and fellow musicians cooking, eating and jamming at Hall’s home in New York.</p>\n<p>Seeing Daryl Hall and John Oates live in concert was certainly a unique experience, and one I will fondly reminisce on the next time I hear their songs come on my favorite oldies radio station.</p>\n<p>To check

The line of vendors was diverse enough to provide something for everyone. There were a few merchandise stands selling crystal gem jewelry and feathery headbands, while Lucidity had a booth for those looking to buy some true bohemian garb.</p>\n<p>Because of Hope, a nonprofit that raises money for Uganda by selling their handmade goods, had a stand and, while they refrained from solicitation (thank god), they were on hand to educate passers-by about their mission. Art from Scrap, a local organization that keeps reusable art materials donated from resident businesses, provided a station where people could stop and make themselves a headband or bracelet for free.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Adjacent to the vendors there was a small food court with a seated area set against the backdrop of live mural paintings. Inspired by a girl painting a sea creature on what appeared to be a large dumpster, a few other artists started to set up shop and paint away for all to politely observe. Past the artisan popsicle stand and a wood-fired pizza oven, there lay the quintessential taco truck with three tacos for $5, making the meager food selection A-okay in my humble opinion.</p>\n<p>Between the live mural paintings, silent disco and local art vendors, the New Noise Block Party held strong elements of DIY, and the atmosphere was largely created by the attendees. People did not simply show up to see Cherub (okay, maybe some did), but also to interact within the community and truly see what the Santa Barbara art world has to offer.</p>\n<p>The harmonious nature of the mini-fest manifested itself when Kip, lead singer of rock-pop band The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, amicably handed me a free CD when I mentioned that I would unfortunately be missing their set. The sense of community reminded me that the Block Party was just as much about the local artists and networking in Santa Barbara as it was about the performances themselves. Although sometimes overshadowed by the bar scene, downtown Santa Barbara has a very conscious artistic community. New Noise Conference and Music Festival perfectly embodied this realm. The Block Party seamlessly concluded a weekend of music, education, networking and just plain ol’ good times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/XlZtvEM5mf4frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XlZtvEM5mf4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57751\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57751\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/","id":7076,"author":{"id":760,"name":"Jasmine Salvino"},"related":[7075,7074,7073],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yellow Red Sparks Fly as The Kinds Join In at Muddy Waters","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Making my way past the shelves of knick-knacks and through the powerful aroma of coffee sizzling in the air, I found a cramped spot in the crowded coffee shop to catch two shows — The Kinds and Yell...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Making my way past the shelves of knick-knacks and through the powerful aroma of coffee sizzling in the air, I found a cramped spot in the crowded coffee shop to catch two shows — The Kinds and Yellow Red Sparks. As a first-timer at Muddy Waters Coffee House, which is just a mile away from the bustling excitement of State Street, I immediately felt at home. Its dim lighting, art-filled walls, funky light fixtures and vintage couches gave the venue a cozy and relaxed feel. Enthusiastic members from all over the Santa Barbara and greater SoCal area welcomed the two Cali-based bands to the scene last Friday night, Oct. 17 as a part of the New Noise Conference and Music Festival.</p>\n<p>YELLOW RED SPARKS</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57737\" style=\"width: 355px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"712349381\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57736\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57737\" data-attachment-id=\"57737\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/yellow-red-sparks-1012-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1337478691\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57737\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=345%2C230\" alt=\"Courtesy of wptsradio.com\" width=\"345\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>wptsradio.com</em></p></div>\n<p>The first band, Yellow Red Sparks, is a four-piece collective from Irvine, Calif., composed of Joshua Hanson (vocals/songwriter/guitar), Darren “Goldy” Goldstein (drums), Sarah Lynn Nishikawa (bass) and Mike Harris (keyboard).

This tune quickly drew in a crowd to the main area of the coffee shop, with attendees bopping their heads and swaying their bodies to the rhythm. Slowing down the mood of the locale, their second song “Buy Me Honey” revealed a more melodramatic theme. They continued to play songs off their self-titled album, including the popular “Scents and Sensibility” and “Monsters with Misdemeanors,” as well as new songs not yet released.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the show was their rendition of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” Hanson asked the audience to sing along to “help break some ice,” which ended up bringing the crowd even closer together. The combination of Hanson’s dulcet voice with the melodic group vocals of the audience created a beautiful and dreamlike atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The band’s cinematic/indie folk tunes and sentimental melodies fused together to produce uplifting and heartfelt anthems. Their fun stage presence also added to the intimacy of the set, making me feel lucky that I was able to be a part of something so inimitable. Closing out with a song titled “Seven Seas,” which the group announced will be coming out next month, the Yellow Red Sparks left a positive vibe behind in Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p>After their set, I caught up with them on the sidewalk outside of the venue. When I asked how Yellow Red Sparks came to be, they had an interesting story to tell. “Basically, I was just doing coffee shop stuff and Goldy took some of my songs and added drums to it,” Hanson explained. From there, Goldy introduced Hanson to Nishikawa, an upright bass player who Goldy was teaching drums to at the time. The trio formed a band, and later added the fourth member, Mike, who the group affectionately calls the “newbie.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the significance of their band name, Hanson laid out the dynamics for me. “The band name initially comes from our song entitled ‘Yellow Red Sparks,’ which is also a part of our self-titled album. To me, the phrase means passion, with the mellow color of yellow colliding with the vibrant color of red.”</p>\n<p>Adding to this comment, Goldy mentioned that “the term mirrors the emotional push-and-pull that comes with relationships — both the loving and the heated parts.” These opposite emotions, which we all can identify with, were felt through the set as their songs encompassed expressions of both joy and melancholy as a way to meticulously depict all realities of what it means to be human. I could sense this up-and-down pattern as the band moved from song to song, feeling hopeful through one moment and feeling somber through the other.</p>\n<p>These ideas tie in with the main themes of the band’s lyrics. “Our songs are about human stuff,” said Hanson in a whimsical manner. “They’re all about struggling with relationships and the challenge of maintaining faith and hope throughout it all. I like to call it the human struggle.”</p>\n<p>I could tell that Hanson was deep in his thoughts by the way he stared at the concrete beneath him, hands in his pockets. For a second he collected his thoughts, a slight frown on his forehead. Suddenly he looked up and continued, “The goal for us is to affect people with music. We don’t just want it to be something that people bop their heads to, but to be something that makes people feel something.”</p>\n<p>A genuine look on his face, Hanson left me with this message: “We want to connect with people and take that as far as we can, whether that’s to a hundred people or to thousands of people.

While the band has played the New Noise Festival before, this was their first time headlining for the event.</p>\n<p>They opened their performance with one of their most popular songs, “Been a Long Time.” This song combined the soothing rhythm of the guitar with the compelling female vocals of the lead singer, which immediately set a warm tone for the show. Elements of indie, folk, rock and country were apparent throughout their songs, fascinating the crowd with irresistible forms of musicianship that nobody could quite walk away from.</p>\n<p>While their set included emotionally-striking songs that were a little on the slow side, they also included high-energy tunes that got the whole crowd to dance. The faster songs included empowering guitar solos and catchy melodies, while the slower ones transformed the venue into a wistful scene. While every song was unique on its own, each tune brought out romantic and heart-felt themes about love and equality.</p>\n<p>The showmanship of the combo also created a folksy mood that perfectly complimented the relaxed feel of the coffee shop. Band members smiled often, sipping on beers. They even described one of their songs, entitled “Runaway”, as a “beer drinking song,” and quickly turned this anecdote into a drinking game by encouraging the crowd to take a sip from their brews during certain lyrics.</p>\n<p>I stuck around after their set and had a chance to interview Modisette and Bergstrom as they were packing up their equipment. The lead lady singer told me about the creation of The Kinds, which sprang to life about five years ago. “Nate and I were playing together for a while when one of our close friends introduced us to Erich. Out of the blue, Anders showed up and starting playing with us,” said Modisette. “It all worked together really well, and the creation of the band was just kind of instant.”</p>\n<p>From there, The Kinds have focused on playing local shows with more casual intentions. “Part of the reason why I love playing with this ensemble is that everybody is on a professional level, but we just do it for fun,” explained Bergstrom with a gleeful look on his face. “This is our passion, and being able to play and have a great time doing it is really why we’re here.” From what I could tell, the convivial response from their close-knit Santa Barbara supporters is all The Kinds really need.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other bands, The Kinds have no desire to get signed. Apart from having daytime jobs and families to take care of, they come together as a band to focus most of their attention on enjoying the act of music-making. In regards to making it big, however, getting signed is one of their last priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost not even a consideration. It just doesn’t seem like us,” said Modisette. Nodding his head, Bergstrom laughably commented that each member comes “from different facets of the music industry, and there was this interesting moment that we realized that we could be as good as anybody but not be as stressed as everybody else.” All in all, The Kinds are just a good-hearted, small-town band who wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p>As the night came to a close, it was certain that The Kinds’ nonchalant take on music and folksy tunes had once more left a warm impression on the guests of Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;

lead singer Jackson Guthy shouted, energized by a full house. ­­Dressed in a tee and skinnies, Guthy charismatically eyed the screaming group of teenage girls lined along the walls, desperate for the boys’ attention. Drummer Rob Ketchum, bassist Edison Lo, keyboardist Nolan Frank and guitarist Michael O’Grady accompanied Guthy’s singing with synchronized hair-whipping and lyric-mouthing. Families relished in a candlelit dinner as the band rocked the evening with newly composed songs, which will constitute their first album. As part of the New Noise Conference and Music Festival, the group took the stage on Sunday, Oct. 19 at SOhO Restaurant and Music Club, a perfectly intimate setting for a sneak peak of their upcoming album. “American Idol” judge Randy Jackson, North of Nine’s producer, made an appearance at the concert to support and take pride in his new band.</p>\n<p>The modern pop-rock quintet performed a set list of six songs including their debut single “We Ride,” which premiered on MTV in Sept. For this piece, keyboardist Nolan Frank stepped aside for the song’s writer and composer, Guthy, to play keyboard alongside rounded-out drumming and guitar. The ballad displayed the delicate side of the pop-rockers, leaving enchanted fans listening to the song on loop.</p>\n<p>Emily Castro, a recent fan of the band, is looking forward to North of Nine’s first album. “[‘We Ride’] is <em>so </em>soothing. I almost wish Jack was serenading to me … But besides that, they’re gonna bring something fresh and I’m looking forward to it!” Castro said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sixth on the set list that evening was a cover of Jimmy Eat World’s top five <em>Billboard </em>Hot 100 hit in 2002, “The Middle.” The band brought back the vitality of Jimmy Eat World and had the audience up on their feet, clapping to the beat. Further information on the night’s set list cannot be provided until the release of their first album.</p>\n<p>The group performed a variety of tunes throughout the night, taking their audience back and forth stylistically in their music. In sync with the current rock scene, the group labels themselves under modern pop-rock — which ranges from a mellower form of rock music to a subgenre of pop music. North of Nine appeals to the teenage age group with lyrics such as, “Lovin‘ you is like flyin‘ a rocket to the moon.”</p>\n<p>The band created contagious, energetic vibes as they indulged themselves in their music. The newly-formed group interacted closely onstage with dynamic expressions and exaggerated movements. Ricky Vitucci, the quintet’s artist coordinator, insisted that the group’s exceptional chemistry exists both on- and offstage. “The chemistry is crazy good for five males in one room … they all have different ideas. They don’t fight; they don’t argue. The vibe is amazing. When they’re in the same room, they get raw ideas like this,” Vitucci said as he snapped his fingers.</p>\n<p>After the performance, I caught up with bassist Edison Lo and he told me what fans should expect in the near future. “By the end of the year, we wanna release an album. We’ve been writing a lot, rehearsing a lot. Right now, we’re doing a bunch of demo songs,” said Lo. Vitucci added at the end, “<em>You’re in for a treat</em>.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/sV_hOnquxi8frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sV_hOnquxi8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>North of Nine’s new hit single “We Ride” is on iTunes and Spotify.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57748\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57748\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/pop-rockers-north-of-nine-play-soho/","id":7078,"author":{"id":750,"name":"Sophie Ho"},"related":[7077,7076,7075],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
