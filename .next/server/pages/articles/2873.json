The event split participants into three groups and covered three different walking routes: behind Davidson Library; from Girvetz Hall to the Student Resource Building (SRB); near the bus loop and the RecCen. Each group was led by a UCPD officer, two university staff members and two CSOs.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher said safety involves “adequate lighting” on campus, and Administrative Services strives to address lighting issues every year.</p>\n<p>“It is very important for people to feel safe within the community,” Fisher said. “We have been working on new lighting projects for the past twelve years, since I have personally been here.”</p>\n<p>According to Fisher, old round light bulbs, also called “Johnny Balls,” will be replaced in every walkway with newer and stronger white lighting.</p>\n<p>“We have replaced fixtures such as Johnny Balls,” Fisher said. “Our goal is to have most of those replaced throughout the walkways. We want a whiter light everywhere and we see lighting deficiency right now, but it will be improved.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the university is installing new lighting because the currently-placed bulbs are an outdated brand that contribute to light pollution.</p>\n<p>“The old Johnny Balls were created in the 1960s, but we are replacing the old style fixtures,” Fisher said. “These globe lights produce sky globes, and one of the goals of the campus is to change this because in an environmental perspective, it spills light into the sky for color rendition and we want light on the ground as opposed to the sky.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD Patrol Sergeant Matt Blime said bright lighting prevents crime from occurring on campus and allows students to feel more safe on campus at night.</p>\n<p>“I think proper lighting on campus is a deterrence for crime,” Blime said. “If a person is looking to commit a crime, it is less likely that they will do it in an area that is very well lit. At the same time, it gives students more of a sense of safety and security while walking on the campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Blime, serious crimes on campus have been less frequent over the past year due to student participation in safety-related events.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote safety, for everyone here,” Blime said. “We have had a reduction of serious crime in the past year. We have had a 10-20 percent decrease in crimes and it has become more popular for students to participate in these walks and create more safety because we address concerns.”</p>\n<p>Campus Senior Electrical Utility Lead Jim Morrison said a person’s facial expression is more visible under whiter light, which would expose the intentions of a potential perpetrator before a crime is committed.</p>\n<p>“We want more white light,” Morrison said. “During the summer months, they stay on for nine hours and 13 hours in the winter time. If you have a whiter light, you can see facial expressions more. Before a crime, you can see if people look ticked-off and this light makes it possible to see.”</p>\n<p>Biology graduate student graduate Emily Ellis said it is discomforting to walk to her car at night in the dark after late classes.</p>\n<p>“The animals that I study are nocturnal,” Ellis said. “I am happy to stay for experiments, but it is unnerving when it is pitch black and I am the only person on campus. I definitely walk faster and only go towards areas where it is well-lit.”</p>\n<p>Ellis said she worries about her students’ safety when they leave her class at 10 p.m. because the Life Sciences Building currently does not have sufficient lighting due to construction at Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>“It is good to see what is around you and to feel safe as if you are in your own home,” Ellis said. “I worry for them because you never know what can happen.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, administrators and police officers have demonstrated throughout the years that they are invested in ensuring student safety.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is really assuring that people care about the student concerns. It seems like the administrators and UCPD officers really care about the opinions of students. The survey that was sent out via email recently is an example of this as well.”</p>\n<p>CSO officer and fourth-year Chican@ studies major Melissa Cruz said theft is the most common crime on campus. According to her, theft occurs frequently because darkness facilitates stealing.</p>\n<p>“I have been a CSO for three years and the lights have always been important,” Cruz said, “It brightens up the campus and deters people from stealing things. Stealing is the biggest issue here at UCSB, especially stealing bikes.”</p>\n<p>Cruz said CSO flashlights can only do so much to prevent theft at night and that the new installation of lights will help significantly more in preventing crime.</p>\n<p>“If somebody looks suspicious, we only flash our lights at them,” Cruz said. “But if there are lights then it can prevent them from stealing bikes.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/","id":2873,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2872,2871,2870],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva","biography":"Not available","articles":[2755,2842,2861,2873,2882,2911,2921,2929,2956,4704,4725,4746,4753,4762,4784],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Speace’s Pieces: Keep Going, Jeter","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Harking back to my column written last month, I am here to pledge my allegiance to Derek Jeter.

Given the fact that the Yankees are officially out of the hunt for October (or now, November?), it is time to make some moves. One such move that the Yankees should not make is unloading the Jeter. And yes, he is THE Jeter, mainly because of all he has done for the most storied franchise in MLB history.</p>\n<p>“Derek is a lot like Cal [Ripken] because he represents all that our society aspires to be and what our game aspires to be. He takes his job seriously. He goes to work everyday and he does it with pride for his franchise and for his city.” This quote is from Brian Cashman, general manager of the Yankees, who has Jeter’s destiny in the palms of his 2010 World Series ring-less hands. Jeter has always represented everything that a “Yankee” should. In the truest sense of the word, a “yankee” is a slang term for an American. Amongst other traits, being an American involves being proud, determined, optimistic, resilient, classy and powerful.  Throughout his years, Derek has been all of the above, and more.</p>\n<p>Mr. November, Mr. October, Captain Clutch, DJ — call him what you want, but he will always be the constant professional, a sort of golden pillar others try to measure up to. You cannot blame my love for the man; everyone else feels the same. There exists countless quotes from fans of all types, including Michael Jordan, Daryl Strawberry and Mr. October himself, Reggie Jackson, singing his praises. His work ethic is unparalleled. Jeter has been working overtime since he was a kid in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was named High School Player of the Year while owning a .600 batting average, to his home in the Bronx, where he is looking to ring in another year in pinstripes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As I touched on in my earlier column, Jeter’s skills are fading. In fact, this past year has been his worst in almost all facets of the game — batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and even fielding. You know what I say? Big deal, it happens to everyone. ESPN’s Major League Baseball resident expert, Tim Kurkjian, has reported that Jeter has been reaching out to various hitting and fielding coaches to help him change up his game, utilizing the strengths he has left, and hiding the weaknesses. This is what all the greats have had to do, for example, with Jordan turning into a post-up player instead of a one-on-one face-up master.</p>\n<p>The thing is Derek doesn’t need to pull in the huge bucks in regards to his salary. He is the only player in baseball who pulls in $9 million on the reg with his endorsements with Gatorade, Nike, Ford Motors and Gillette. He doesn’t exactly need the $22 million annually he is receiving from the Steinbrenners. What Derek Jeter needs, and what the rest of America wants, is for him to keep wearing those pinstripes. It goes best with his sparkling white teeth.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus MLB columnist Julia Speace is a little biased because she likes her men tall, dark and handsome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/","id":2870,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2869,2868,2867],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: First Half Fantasy Awards","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"To mark the halfway point of the season, instead of giving you another dose of my ever-so-helpful advice, I’ve decided to hand out awards to the players I thought had exceptionally remarkable first ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Can you believe it?

There are defenses out there that have had better individual fantasy days, but few units have been as consistent as this one. The Titans defense has had only two single-digit fantasy outings, and with veteran players like linebacker Will Witherspoon and cornerback Cortland Finnegan leading the defense, that trend is going to continue.</p>\n<p>Best Tight End: Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers.</p>\n<p>There isn’t anything you can say about this guy that hasn’t been said. Gates has been hauling in touchdowns for the Chargers since 2003, and in a year when the 3-5 Chargers can’t get anything going, he has not slowed down. He has nine touchdowns and only one game without one, and has gotten his fantasy owners 15+ points in five of eight games. He currently has no equal at the position.</p>\n<p>Best Wide Receiver: Calvin Johnson, Detroit Lions.</p>\n<p>It’s between him and Falcons wide receiver Roddy White, but in the end it came down to the fact that Johnson has maintained All-Pro numbers with Shaun Hill running the offense. Now that Matthew Stafford is back from injury, Johnson is going to be unstoppable. Fantasy owners got a taste of what is to come with Sunday’s 101-yard, three-touchdown performance. That’s only the beginning. All hail Megatron.</p>\n<p>Best Running Back: Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings.</p>\n<p>In a world in which Chris Johnson was drafted first, Adrian Peterson is king. After a rather lackluster opening game, Peterson returned to form with a vengeance in week two and since then has continued to prove why he is the best at what he does, which is making defenders look like they just got promoted from Pop Warner. With three 130+ yard rushing days and four 20+ fantasy point days, Peterson has certainly outplayed the inconsistent Johnson, and has been the only bright spot on a dismal Vikings offense.</p>\n<p>Best Quarterback: Peyton Manning, Indianapolis Colts.</p>\n<p>Numbers don’t lie. Manning has tossed 15 touchdowns to just two interceptions, and has thrown for fewer than 300 yards in just three games. No other quarterback has played nearly as well and it’s as simple as that.</p>\n<p>Biggest Surprise: Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB, Buffalo Bills.</p>\n<p>Since taking over the offense in week three, Fitzy has averaged 19.6 points per game, which is better than quarterbacks such as Matt Schaub, Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, and Joe Flacco over the same period of time. Now I don’t know what kind of deal Fitzy had to make with the devil to be able to do what he’s doing, but it was definitely worth it. The 0-7 Bills still have no hope of a playoff spot, but Fitzy has given the fantasy world a Bills player worth starting. That’s surprising enough on its own.</p>\n<p>Biggest Letdown (a.k.a. the Jamarcus Russell Award): Brett Favre, QB, Minnesota Vikings.</p>\n<p>No one was surprised when Favre announced that he was coming back after almost leading the Vikings to a Superbowl just last season, and fantasy owners had good reason to believe that he would be able to, if not duplicate exactly, at least come close to his numbers from last season. However, it would appear that age has finally caught up with Favre, who has managed just one double-digit fantasy day while leading the Vikings to a 2-5 record thus far. You should have stayed retired, Brett.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg receives the award for best unsolicited fantasy football advice given by any UCSB student named Joshua Greenberg.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28910\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28910\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/","id":2871,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2870,2869,2868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2006-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Incorrectly Marking His Territory","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Incorrectly Marking His Territory<br>\nFriday, Oct. 13, 11:46 p.m. – Officers walking down the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive watched a 19-year-old man stumbling from side to side down the street.</p>\n<p>The man swaggered up a driveway, went behind a vehicle and began to unzip his pants in preparation for urination.</p>\n<p>Before the man could relieve himself, he saw the deputies approaching, zipped up his pants and walked into the front yard of the residence.</p>\n<p>The man’s balance was unsteady, and when officers contacted him, they detected a strong odor of alcohol.</p>\n<p>The man, apparently oblivious to the officer in front of him, then again began to unzip his pants in order to pee.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the man to put away his package, and began questioning him. They soon learned that the man was a bit confused when he announced that he was going to walk down “Via Cadero” to get to his home – in San Bernardino.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the man how he was possibly going to make it home from his current location, the man explained that he would walk straight and turn left.</p>\n<p>Since the subject’s projected path would lead him directly into the Pacific Ocean, the officer decided that the man was too intoxicated to care for his own safety and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Exorcism of Inebriated Rose<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 14, 11:58 p.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road contacted a 19-year-old woman when they saw her lying on the sidewalk with her head in a man’s lap.</p>\n<p>An officer approached the woman, but she was completely unresponsive and would not reply to any of his questions. For the woman’s safety, the officer called the paramedics.</p>\n<p>A few minutes after UCSB paramedics arrived on the scene, they requested assistance from the IVFP because the woman was trying to escape from the medics, kicking and yelling to get away.</p>\n<p>The medics confirmed that the woman was not in medical distress, only extremely intoxicated. The medics placed the woman in the officer’s custody.</p>\n<p>Throughout the incident, the subject yelled expletives, and at one point her blouse fell down exposing her chest; throughout she was unsteady on her feet.</p>\n<p>After her little peep show, officers decided the woman was too intoxicated to care for her safety or the safety of others, and placed her under arrest.</p>\n<p>After being taken into custody, she went on a drunken tirade, calling everyone present “fuckers,” and assuring officers that her “lawyer” had guaranteed that she was not to be touched.</p>\n<p>She also said her lawyer, with whom she must have communicated telepathically, demanded that she be freed, all the while managing to maintain a steady stream of obscenities.</p>\n<p>The woman continued to rant as she was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was booked – despite her lawyer’s promise – pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Insane in the Membrane<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 14 12:44 a.m. – Officers responding to an incident in progress on the corner of Sabado Tarde Road and El Embarcadero arrested an 18-year-old man who was fighting on the street.</p>\n<p>The subject was hit in the head during the scuffle, and deputies had the UCSB medics examine him before questioning him.</p>\n<p>When the man’s health was cleared, an officer attempted to speak with him. The subject was only able to answer one of the officer’s questions, an inquiry into the amount of alcohol he drank, to which he replied, “A lot.” Then the man repeatedly announced, “I’m drunk as fuck.”</p>\n<p>The subject also failed to remember where he lived, admitting, “I can’t remember ‘cuz I’m drunk as fuck.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for being “drunk as fuck” and he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-16/police-blotter-11/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-16/police-blotter-11/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-16/police-blotter-11/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-16/police-blotter-11/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-16/police-blotter-11/","id":2872,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[2871,2870,2869],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
