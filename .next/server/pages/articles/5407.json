The junior outside hitter just never imagined that his sport would be volleyball. The hometown hero’s path to UCSB, while somewhat expected, certainly took some interesting turns along the way.Evans was a natural-born athlete, participating in all sports growing up with a special eye toward playing collegiately at UCSB. Volleyball, however, had not even crossed his mind when it came to athletics. It was not until his sophomore year at Dos Pueblos High School that he tried his hand at the sport.</p>\n<p>“I was bad at volleyball my first two years playing, and then something clicked where I really enjoyed playing and wanted to get better,” Evans said. “I practiced every day just for fun.”</p>\n<p>Encouraged by his former junior high physical education coach Chris Hughes, also the volleyball coach at Dos Pueblos High, Evans conceited to give it a shot, a decision that proved beneficial for both him and the community of Santa Barbara.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It took Miles about a half year to get hooked, and that’s all he wanted to do: play volleyball,” Hughes said. “As a coach, it makes me really proud. Miles never played volleyball until his sophomore year and look at him now.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Evans improved enough to play club ball his senior year in 2007, even garnering attention from college programs interested in recruiting him to play Division I volleyball.</p>\n<p>“I got recruited by Hawaii, Northridge and UCSB out of high school,” Evans said. “But I didn’t take my SATs because I didn’t know I was that good at volleyball, or I didn’t know I was going to be.”</p>\n<p>Unable to register at any of the colleges that recruited him, Evans enrolled at SBCC to begin his pursuit of a newfound dream of playing collegiate volleyball at UCSB. After redshirting one year in 2008, Evans finally tried to show he could handle his own at the junior college level.</p>\n<p>Things did not go according to plan. After a mere two games, Evans was kicked off the team at SBCC by the coach – not for lack of talent, but for personal reasons.“I was actually one of the better players on the team, and I got cut because I had a huge ego,” Evans said. “I was like the virus on the team because I was thinking I was so good, so the coach cut me.” With one year of eligibility wasted, Evans came back and went on to play the next season under the same coach at SBCC, where he led the state in kills. While continually receiving interest from local universities, he still did not have the grades to make it into a four-year university.</p>\n<p>That’s when Evans redshirted at UCSB to improve his grades and qualify academically. In his spare time, he was able to practice with the team and eventually gained admission before the 2011-2012 school year. “He is hungry for this sport,” UCSB Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Miles is hungry, he hasn’t experienced a lot of this stuff and he’s done a great job for us this year. I even expect him next year to be one of the best guys in the league.” Evans led the Gauchos this year with a team-high 325 kills and ranked No. 11 in league in kills per set with nearly 3.5 per and 14th in digs. Five years after graduating high school, the rest of Santa Barbara has finally been able to see the type of player Evans can be – a player that several coaches envisioned so long ago.</p>\n<p>“He has a ton of potential and he has the ability to play this game beyond college, whether it’s professional or with our national team,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>A leader on the floor with his play, Evans always draws a crowd in home matches with his own cheering section usually accompanying him and waiting to greet him after the games.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing; it’s a great experience because the community really enjoys me playing for UCSB,” Evans said. “There are a lot of friends that get to watch the matches. I love being a part of the community and representing Santa Barbara, it’s really awesome to play for UCSB, it’s always been a dream of mine.”</p>\n<p>Although finally a student at UCSB, Evans by no means has a normal college life, still living at home in Goleta with his family to save money and focus more on schoolwork. Coming from a family in which he is the youngest of five, including two half-sisters, a half-brother and a stepsister, Evans has managed to balance college life with the everyday distractions that come with living at home.</p>\n<p>“I think it has been benefiting me in many ways because I don’t have to deal with the whole I.V. scene and the whole party scene,” Evans said. “I would love to move out here next year, but at the same time, it’s more realistic to stay at home and stay more focused on my studies rather than having fun.”</p>\n<p>Focused on pursuing a career in volleyball, Evans, a sociology major, hopes to one day go back to school for a master’s degree when his days of volleyball are over. Dreams of a professional career seem to be a possibility, with a hint at the Olympics as the ultimate goal for Evans.</p>\n<p>“This is my dream,” Evans said. “I’ve always wanted to be where I’m at right now. Now I just need to set higher and higher goals, and see where volleyball can take me.”</p>\n<p>Volleyball, once an afterthought to Miles Evans, has become a way of life, providing him with the opportunity to chase his dreams and receive a higher education.</p>\n<p>“I honestly don’t know what I would have done if I didn’t get into volleyball,” Evans said. “I could say that without volleyball, I couldn’t get through college, to tell you the truth.”</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Evans are surely grateful for the switch to volleyball and all of the opportunities that may come next season in what looks to be a promising senior year for Miles Evans and the rest of Gaucho squad.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/home-home/","id":5407,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5406,5405,5404],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Add Depth With Four Recruits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After only one senior graduated from a team that finished tied for 10th in the MPSF, the UCSB men’s volleyball team brings in four standout recruits in hopes of getting back to postseason play.

Seif features extraordinary height for a setter, an asset likely to aid UCSB for years to come.</p>\n<p>“When setters get that big, you worry about their footwork and how fast they are, and Jonah has great footwork, he’s quick,” McLaughlin said. “We’re real excited about him. He’s going to be competing for a starting spot right away.”</p>\n<p>Another highly touted recruit, Jacob Delson, is expected to contribute immediately next season. Delson, a 6’5’’ outside hitter from Westlake High School in Westlake Village, Calif., led his team to this season’s CIF playoffs.</p>\n<p>“I think he’ll compete right away for a spot,” McLaughlin said. “He’s a good all-around player, very competitive, and he’s going to go after a starting spot right away and compete with the other guys returning.”</p>\n<p>Adding some versatility for UCSB will be Parker Boehle, a 5’8’’ libero from Loyola High School in Los Angeles. Boehle helped his team to a championship appearance in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>“[His height] is a little bit of a disadvantage, but Parker has learned how to deal with that,” McLaughlin said. “He’s got good skills and he knows the game well. [Sophomore libero Chad Kingi] is going to come back and probably start for sure; I think Parker is probably a year or two away.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the class for UCSB is 6’4” setter Andrew Kocur out of Saint Michael’s College School in Toronto, Canada. Kocur previously played for Canada’s junior national team.</p>\n<p>“Andrew is a very experienced setter for his age,” McLaughlin said. “He is really going to have a shot at starting for us at setter.”</p>\n<p>All four recruits were featured on the FAB 50, a list of the top 50 high school players.</p>\n<p>“I think they have as good a shot as the guys returning,” McLaughlin said. “It’s going to be a wide open battle for who’s going to be out there.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/gauchos-add-depth-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/gauchos-add-depth-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/gauchos-add-depth-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/gauchos-add-depth-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/gauchos-add-depth-recruits/","id":5404,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5403,5402,5401],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Play for Post-Season Appearance","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Kenneth-Song_vball-v-Hawaii-1161.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Kenneth-Song_vball-v-Hawaii-1161.jpg?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"With a berth to the postseason on the line, the UCSB men’s volleyball team will play its final two regular season games of the year when traveling to Stanford and Pacific this weekend.

A loss will end the Gauchos’ hopes for a postseason berth, as they need both victories this weekend along with a loss from UCSD and two from Northridge.</p>\n<p>“Winning these two matches [against Hawaii] will definitely give us more confidence going into the next games,” junior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “I feel like we’re really going to play our best for these next two matches and show, just like we did here that we can play volleyball.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos sit at 7-17 overall with a 5-15 mark in the MPSF, while Stanford is battling for home court advantage in the conference tournament with a 15-5 record in the MPSF (18-6 overall). The Cardinal currently is tied for fourth in the standings, but still hold an outside chance of locking up a number one seed.</p>\n<p>Last weekend’s two victories snapped an eight game losing skid for the Gauchos, wins they hope will carry momentum heading up north this weekend.</p>\n<p>“It’s huge, we had a long time there without a win,” McLaughlin said. “Anytime you can get a back-to-back win, yet alone one win, our confidence is better. ”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match against Pacific will be a source of redemption for the Gauchos, as UCSB previously fell 3-1 when hosting Pacific, a game which they felt they should have won.</p>\n<p>“Pacific beat us up down here early in the season, and our guys are hungry for that match,” McLaughlin said. “We didn’t play well, and they can’t wait to get to that match.”</p>\n<p>No. 13 Pacific stands at 7-19 on the season, and with a 4-16 mark in the MPSF have already been eliminated from postseason play. The Tigers have lost five matches in a row, a mark likely to be extended to six on Friday night when they host No. 3 UCLA.</p>\n<p>Winning two straight on the road might be difficult for the Gauchos, as the team is 2-7 all year in opponents’ home gymnasiums.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like it’s going to be any different than playing here,” Evans said. “I just feel like we’re going to have to play as a team, really keep up our team chemistry, and stay loose, aggressive and confident.”</p>\n<p>Evans led the Gauchos in kills for both matches against Hawaii last weekend, registering a career-high 21 on Saturday. Blocking meanwhile also seemed to be a strong point for UCSB as junior middle blocker Dylan Davis dominated, tallying a combined 19 blocks in the two matches.</p>\n<p>“Blocking is crucial for the next two matches,” Evans said.” It really helped [last week], so if we can do the same, we can really get some good results next time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ lone senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen will be playing in his final two matches this weekend if UCSB fails to qualify for the playoffs. N</p>\n<p>“Finally we have some good momentum,” Nielsen said after Saturday’s win over Hawaii. “The best thing about this is these hard practices where we’ve been grinding … it’s finally paying off.”</p>\n<p>Matches on Friday and Saturday night both start at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion at Stanford and the Alex G. Spanos Center at Pacific.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/gauchos-play-postseason-appearance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/gauchos-play-postseason-appearance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/gauchos-play-postseason-appearance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/gauchos-play-postseason-appearance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-13/gauchos-play-postseason-appearance/","id":5405,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5404,5403,5402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Finishes Season With Weekend Losses","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the road for the final two regular season games of the year, the UCSB men’s volleyball team dropped a pair of tough matches, eliminating the Gauchos from the playoffs.

Northridge clinched the eighth and final playoff spot with a victory over Pepperdine on Thursday night to officially eliminate the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“To miss the playoffs is a terrible feeling, especially to a team like Northridge that we played three times and we beat them twice, and there they are in the playoffs,” Donohue said. “Only a couple games that we lost this year kept us out of the playoffs. We need to learn from that.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s loss to Pacific was a heartbreaking one for the Gauchos as they squandered a 2-0 lead to lose in five sets. Donohue posted a career-high 22 kills in the defeat, matching a Gaucho season high set by junior middle blocker Dylan Davis on Feb. 29 against Northridge.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely my best match of the year,” Donohue said. “[Junior setter] Oliver [Deutschman] was putting the ball in a perfect position for me to hit, and we found a rhythm together.”</p>\n<p>No. 13 Pacific improved to 8-20 overall (5-17 MPSF) with the victory coming after a 3-1 loss to No. 3 UCLA on Friday night. The Gauchos overpowered Pacific in the first two sets by scores of 25-20 and 26-24 before dropping three straight: 18-25, 23-25 and 12-15.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Miles Evans recorded 17 kills while senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen added a career-high 13 to go along with 16 digs in his final match as a Gaucho. Deutschman’s 60 assists — a personal season high — were the most posted by a Gaucho this season.</p>\n<p>“[Saturday] night we came out, and we were on fire the first two games and basically found a rhythm,” Donohue said. “It was kind of a tough loss there, but we kept our heads high. I think these five-game matches where we were up 2-0, we’re going to learn from these losses that we had.”</p>\n<p>Friday night’s match at No. 5 Stanford resulted in a sweep for the Cardinal by a mark of 25-19, 25-14, 25-20. Stanford tied for second in the MPSF with a 17-5 conference record (20-6 overall) and will be the number two seed in the conference tournament next weekend.</p>\n<p>Senior outside hitter Brad Lawson led the Cardinal in kills with 16, while sophomore outside hitter Steven Irvin added 14.</p>\n<p>Donohue led the Gauchos in kills once again Friday, recording 10 in addition to a team-high five digs.
