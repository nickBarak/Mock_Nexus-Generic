The recruited players are familiar with the big moment and are ready to make an impact immediately, and they could very well compliment an experienced squad of UCSB players.</p>\n<p>Kicking off the top of the Gauchos’ recruiting class, junior college transfer and Community College Player of the Year Jalen Canty provides a much-needed presence on the block that UCSB will lack next year with the departure of seniors Beeler and Brewe.</p>\n<p>Starting all 33 games for the City College of San Francisco last season, the 6-foot-7-inch, 245-pound forward proved to be essential to his team’s success, averaging nearly a double-double with 13.1 points and 9.1 rebounds per game to help lead his team to a CCCAA State Championship.</p>\n<p>A defensive liability on the boards and versatile back-down post player, the former Washington State commit will be seeing quality rotational minutes from Williams and should mesh well with the team’s current arsenal of athletic forwards in Jarriesse Blackmon, Alex Hart and Ami Lakoju.</p>\n<p>Canty also has some ongoing chemistry with sophomore Gabe Vincent as both were former teammates on the AAU Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>Among other post-man recruits for Santa Barbara is the 6-foot-8-inch senior out of Besant Hill Academy, Felix White. A candidate for the First Team All-CIF Division VI, the international forward from Nigeria has the tangible skillset and basketball IQ necessary to excel at the next level.</p>\n<p>Aside from his team-leading averages of 17.3 points per game and 10.6 rebounds per game during his senior year, White compiled a cumulative 3.42 GPA during his three years at Besant Hill. This intelligence in the classroom is a trait White hopes to translate onto the hardwood next season against much bigger, faster and smarter talent in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With Big West premiere players such as Bryson and Green sealing their legacy in a blue and gold uniform, Santa Barbara will have to anchor itself with a new core of scorers this upcoming year.</p>\n<p>Surely Vincent and junior Eric Childress will be fundamental assets to the team’s offense; however, the two Conference Honorable Mentions now have some help with a collection of new wing players seeking to make an impact.</p>\n<p>Christian Terrell, Max Heidegger, Mickey Mitchell and Clifton Powell Jr. are all incoming talents capable of stretching the floor and attacking the basket.</p>\n<p>Terrell and Powell, both 6-foot-4-inch combo wings, add to the long list of versatile two-guards under Coach Williams. Named one of the elite players in the area by the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>, Terrell finished his four-year tenure at Sacramento High with a total of 1,279 points. The All-Metro conference player can be a threat on the perimeter, averaging a 35 percent shooting percentage from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Powell, a fifth-year senior out of Woodland Hills, CA has also grown in his scoring ability and lengthy frame as a result of an extra year at 22ft Prep School Academy in South Carolina. A bouncy guard with a knack for knocking down the three, both Powell and Terrell could stand as crucial second-string pieces that fill the void for key bench players T.J. Taylor and DaJuan Smith.</p>\n<p>In addition to these shooting guards are floor generals Heidegger and Ohio-State transfer Mitchell. Heidegger, a 6-foot point guard from just down the road at Oaks Christian, fits in a somewhat smaller category of Division I players, yet his ability to drive, kick and finish at the rim makes him an ideal player under Williams’ guard-oriented system.</p>\n<p>Though transfer regulations will force the 6-foot-7-inch Mitchell to redshirt this upcoming season, the combo forward could possibly have a substantial role in the future with three full years of eligibility remaining at UCSB.</p>\n<p>As the six seniors continue onward to their next phase in life, another set of basketball talent looks to carry on this culture of excellence and mold a new identity for the UCSB men’s basketball team. With pure skill meeting a hungry squad unsatisfied with last year’s Big West Semifinal loss, Williams and his crew might have more of a rewarding season than expected heading into early November.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 26, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/ucsb-anticipates-future-rebuilding-roster-with-recruits/","id":336,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[335,334,333],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Back in Action, Take on NIU in Vegas 16","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite not earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament, the 2015-16 season continues for the UCSB men's basketball team as it will face NIU in the first round of the Vegas 16 Tournament this Monday.

Coming off a 79-62 loss to Ohio University, NIU heads into Mandalay Bay Center with a respective record of 21-12 overall and 9-9 in the MAC.</p>\n<p>Winners of nine-straight before its semifinal loss in Anaheim, UCSB has proven itself as a team capable of finishing strong. Moreover, Santa Barbara has found its spark offensively in the month of March, shooting 48.5 percent from the floor and outscoring opponents by 14.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the opening round of the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara shot 54 percent and went 11-23 from the three-point line in a 26-point victory (87-61) against UC Davis. This matched UCSB’s largest margin of victory against a conference opponent this year.</p>\n<p>While their offensive efficiency has been a concern for opposing teams, the Gauchos’ strong play can also be accredited to a pestering defense that is currently +7 in the turnover margin and averaging 15 or more points off turnovers over a four-game stretch.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Eric Childress has become a vital contributor to this tenacious defense recording a career-high six steals, four in the first twenty minutes of play, in Santa Barbara’s loss to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>With solid performances on both ends of the court, Santa Barbara’s second unit has relieved some pressure in tight situations and been an aid in closing out games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have increased their bench production to nearly half of the team’s total points, 30.3, during this month. While coming up short in their last game, the second unit of UCSB outscored the Warriors’ bench 26-14 commanded by forward Alex Hart. The second year player out of British Columbia, Canada had his best performance yet scoring 13 points in nine minutes of play, trimming a 21-point Hawaii advantage to eight in the second half.</p>\n<p>This mixture of hard-nosed defense, streaky shooting, and bench support will be key ingredients for Head Coach Bob Williams and his team heading into their match against NIU.</p>\n<p>As for fifth year Head Coach Mark Montgomery and his Northern Illinois Huskies, they will rely on a talented core of underclassmen to propel their way to victory. A starting lineup that features two freshmen and one sophomore, the Huskies are a scrappy yet disciplined team that can compete against experienced squads.</p>\n<p>NIU ranked second in the MAC conference this year allowing just 67.1 points per game. With 6’10 forward Marin Maric and All MAC-Defensive Player Aaric Armstead down low, this duo will try and stymie shooters like Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent from getting good looks and driving to the basket.</p>\n<p>While the Huskies finished ninth in the MAC in terms of shooting production, 72.7 points per game, look for an even distribution of scoring by Montgomery’s starters to carry the load offensively.</p>\n<p>Four out of five starters are currently averaging double-figures in scoring for Northern Illinois with Maric leading the pack at 12.1 ppg. The redshirt sophomore from Croatia has tallied home 14 double-doubles on the year, including two 22-point performances this season.</p>\n<p>In the backcourt, senior Travon Baker will be the primary player that the Gauchos’ defense will attempt to contain. NIU’s all-time leader in steals with 181 and second in school history with 355 assists, Baker is a savvy guard who can draw double teams and open up opportunities for his teammates.</p>\n<p>Guards like Vincent and Childress must do a good job keeping Baker in front and limiting his playmaking ability.</p>\n<p>Tip off between the Gauchos and Huskies will take place at 4:30 p.m. CT, 2:30 p.m. PT. The matchup will be broadcasted live on CBS Sports Network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69126\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69126\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/","id":333,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[332,331,330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Postseason Win Since 1990, Face ODU Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A 13-3 run to end the game led to the UCSB men's basketball team to its first postseason victory since 1990 in its 70-63 win over NIU Monday afternoon.

The Huskies drew ten fouls on the Gauchos in the first half hitting 12-17 from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>NIU’s junior guard Aaric Armstead led the way with 12 points and went a perfect 4-4 behind the free throw line. Grabbing down ten rebounds and finishing with a double-double, the third year from Chicago, Illinois failed to register a bucket in the second half.</p>\n<p>Following two converted free throws from freshman forward Jarriese Blackmon to put UCSB on top 19-18, the Huskies compiled a 25-9 run reclaiming the lead and ended the first half with a halftime lead of 43-32.</p>\n<p>A turnover from guard Eric Childress opened up the second half and led to a go-ahead layup from Travon Baker. This gave Northern Illinois its largest lead at 13 points.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the sloppy start, the Gauchos regrouped and responded with a run of their own.</p>\n<p>Off the Baker layup, Eric Childress went coast-to-coast and finished with a finger roll which trimmed NIU’s lead back to 11.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to chip away at the Huskies’ lead as Vincent connected on a free-throw line extended jumper followed by a three-point make from senior Michael Bryson, his second of the night. UCSB regained some momentum and cut the deficit to single-digits, 39-45, with 17:15 left in the game.</p>\n<p>The Huskies continued to battle however in the 11<sup>th</sup> minute as 6’10 forward Marin Maric knocked down a pair of free throws and intercepted a pass from freshman Maxwell Kupchak.</p>\n<p>Maric then found his teammate Marshon Wilson for an easy transition layup maintaining a six-point lead at 52-46. Wilson was a spark for the Huskies’ second unit as the freshman shot 6-11 from the field and finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>With NIU up six points approaching nine minutes to play, the Gauchos assembled their most important run yet.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara pulled away in the final minutes, producing a 13-3 run to end the game.</p>\n<p>Senior Sam Beeler played an effective part in this, racking up 10 of his total 16 points with eight minutes to go including a 15-foot baseline jumper that extended his teams lead to 63-58 with 3:26 left.</p>\n<p>The senior concluded the game with an 8-9 shooting performance, helping UCSB seize its first postseason tournament victory since defeating the University of Houston in the first round of the 1990 NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face Old Dominion in the semifinal round of the Vegas 16 Classic.</p>\n<p>Coming off a 75-59 over Tennessee Tech, the Monarchs are on a streak of their own having won eight of their last nine matchups. Senior guards Aaron Bacote and Trey Freeman combined for a total of 34 points in ODU’s win Monday night.</p>\n<p>Tip off for tonight’s matchup will begin at 6 p.m. in the Mandalay Bay Center.

Bacote scored 21 of his points in the second half, including a 3-6 performance from behind the three.</p>\n<p>A three pointer from Vincent in the 10<sup>th</sup> minute helped cut Santa Barbara’s deficit into single digits at 37-46, but Bacote responded with a three-pointer of his own to put Old Dominion back up by a dozen.</p>\n<p>Trey Freeman made an impact Tuesday night as well. The redshirt senior finished with a double-double, scoring 18 points and racking up 10 rebounds. This was Freeman’s ninth-straight game with 17 or more points.</p>\n<p>The Monarchs outshot UCSB in the second half going 13-26 from the floor and outscored the Gauchos by a margin of 40-25. Turnovers were a deciding factor Tuesday as well as Old Dominion converted 19 points off Santa Barbara’s 14 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Bryson led the way for Santa Barbara with 17 points. Named to this year’s All-Big West team, the senior passed Chris Devine for sixth place all-time in school history with 1,620 points. Bryson also finished among the top ten in blocked shots, free-throw percentage, and will end his collegiate career as UCSB’s all-time leader in three-pointers made with 241.</p>\n<p>Despite a knee injury sidelining him in his final game Thursday night, redshirt senior John Green ends his collegiate career with an average of 10.8 points per game. Playing only 61 games, the Oakland native finished with 658 points, 270 rebounds, and 87 assists.</p>\n<p>Sam Beeler finished with career highs in his final year. Starting all 33 games this season, Beeler tallied in 220 points and 153 rebounds.
