The Senate now plans to meet this Friday at 11 a.m. to vote on the agenda for tonight’s meeting, and again on May 3 at 6 p.m. to vote on tabled bills, pending the approval of Dean of Student Life and Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead to hold a meeting during Week 10. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a regular Senate term, Week 9 of spring quarter is the last meeting of the year before the summer break; due to Zoombombings, the 71st Senate has not been able to hold a full meeting or vote on any resolutions since the new senators were sworn in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s meeting began just after 6:30 p.m., but was stalled as White had difficulty navigating Zoom during the meeting. After Off-Campus Senator Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan motioned to approve all 2020-21 year appointments, with the exception of Attorney General Tyler Barth and those within the Internal Vice President’s (IVP) office, a debate broke out about when to discuss the appointments that had not been pushed through.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After running into problems with voting without the Zoom poll feature, White created a new Zoom link to include the feature. However, immediately after participants joined the new link, multiple Zoombombers disrupted the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Zoombomber loudly shouted, “Fuck you, fuck you dirty bitch.” Others displayed obscene media, including a video of someone appearing to masturbate on camera. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, White muted all participants’ microphones and created a separate Zoom breakout room for the senators to discuss how to handle the rest of the meeting. As senators discussed options, approximately 40 people remained in the main meeting room, where Zoombombers continued to show obscene photos as their images. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once senators realized the disturbances were ongoing, White told senators she would make a new link — the third of the night — to be shared only with the senators and Associated Students (A.S.) staff. A.S. Legislative Liaison Holly Mayes then ended the original meeting without warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senators then met for over an hour in a private Zoom call to discuss when to hold future meetings and what precautions should be taken in light of the Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the last meeting, the senators had thrown around a handful of ideas about how to conduct secure, but public, Zoom meetings. Moving forward, meetings will now be held as Zoom webinars, where only panelists are visible and able to speak, as opposed to anyone in the meeting, according to White. For public forum, individuals will be enabled as panelists when it is their turn to talk, and then will be removed as panelists after speaking in order to prevent future Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To alleviate technical difficulties in executing the new webinar system at the next meeting, senators plan to meet 30 minutes before the meeting on Friday to run through the new format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During tonight’s private meeting, senators also began working on a public statement to address the Zoombombings and the abrupt ending to the regular meeting. White said the Senate plans to publish the statement tomorrow afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

I knew that this job is not being done right,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I came in with a plan and I think I executed it to the best of my abilities; setting deadlines, setting expectations, getting everyone trained. And in regard to that, I think I did quite a good job,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most noticeable shift between Adam and her predecessor, Steven Ho, was their efficiency during meetings. It was rare for a meeting to go past 10 p.m. for the 70th senate, with brief to little discussion for the vast majority of resolutions. Adam attributes this to a greater understanding of meetings through training on authoring resolutions and more emphasis on the “behind the scenes” work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was a senator, so many amendments were being made [in]to bills and resolutions the [same] night we were discussing them. And I just thought that was ridiculous,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that if there were any problems with Legal Code or if a resolution was on a sensitive subject, she would meet with the authors beforehand to avoid a “whole drama-fest.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Wednesday night meetings were just the tip of the iceberg. A lot of the work was beforehand [and] behind the scenes and that’s why the meetings ran so smoothly,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you were going to put forward a bill or a resolution, it should be pretty clean by the time you submit it to the IVP, and the IVP should be reading each one, as I did, to make sure it followed Legal Code,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that behind the scenes work happens away from public view, which some said made for a lack of transparency to the senators’ constituency. Adam, however, said doing the hard work behind doors provided the “best result” for senators and their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why would we show them something sloppy and controversial and that is divisive? If senators are representatives of the public and they can agree on something, then yeah, the public should be able to agree as well using that logic,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam says a lot of the work that went into the Senate’s resolutions was “pretty internal and administrative,” with many updates to the legal codes of Boards, Commissions and Units (BCUs), the student organizations that are within Associated Students (A.S.). Adam called these Legal Code changes “tangible effects” that reflect senators’ better relationships with BCUs than in years prior.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Adam began her term, there were </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/a-s-senate-fills-three-vacancies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three vacancies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Senate: two on-campus senators and one College of Creative Studies Senator, a position that had been vacant for two years. Adam appointed an ad-hoc committee to fill them, and the positions were filled by October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam called the appointments a “team effort,” a theme mirrored throughout many of her accomplishments across the year. This took shape through the solid working relationships she built with her first pro tempore and second pro tempore — Off-Campus Senator Tianna White and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman, respectively. Adam said the strong relationships allowed her to delegate some responsibilities meant for IVP to them, such as attending certain meetings on her behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite not making it to every meeting, Adam said she made herself available through daily office hours and email when she couldn’t be present physically.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparency and availability in A.S. posed a challenge this spring with a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but Adam led the Senate’s shift to weekly Zoom meetings — what she described as a “touch and go situation” — and deemed that the transition was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that that during her term as a senator she felt “pretty deflated within A.S.,” but in the end believes that she cut through a lot of noise to improve the association through her work as both a senator and IVP.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of changed the reputation of the Senate, that’s what I would boil it down to, to being much more student serving, much more respectful of each other, much more productive and much more professional.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for next year, with her first pro tempore White filling her shoes as IVP, Adam said she plans to stay in Santa Barbara.<br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really excited to stay in the area and maybe I’ll come back to a Senate meeting or two.

The second meeting ended abruptly due to multiple instances of Zoombombing, when an unknown individual wrote graphic messages on the shared screen and later verbally interrupted the swearing in with explicit, sexually harassing language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large part of the 70th Senate’s final meeting, which lasted five hours, was spent in public forum discussion about how individual senators and executives had responded to a petition created to recall Beasley after rumors about his alleged inappropriate behavior spread. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Izzy Mitchell, a second-year economics and communication double major who created the petition to hold a recall vote for Beasley, spoke and answered questions during public forum for over an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell called on the Senate to release a formal statement in support of survivors — which they wrote later that night but have yet to publish — and expressed frustration with the senators and executives who have not publicly commented on the allegation against Beasley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell heavily criticized outgoing President Alison Sir in particular, who had </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alison.sirsir/posts/2129784417155065\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released a statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Tuesday night announcing the lockdown of her personal social media accounts and those of the A.S. President due to “extreme harassment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why are we allowing this type of a behavior of shutting down your social media accounts? You cannot choose when you decide to be an elected official,” Mitchell said during public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell said she emailed all senators and executives multiple times about the petition as well as the rumors about Beasley and asked them to respond. Earlier this week, she posted on her social media accounts the names of A.S. executives and senators who she said never got back to her, including Sir. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have attempted to get in contact with you and your staff for over three weeks. Since you have been ‘always happy to speak with students’ throughout your term, we find it abhorid and ironic that you are unable to even merely acknowledge we have emailed you,” Mitchell wrote on Twitter in response to Sir’s lockdown of her social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir ended her final report to the Senate as A.S. President by addressing Mitchell’s public forum comments and social media posts, marking Sir’s first acknowledgement of the allegation against Beasley since it was publicized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was publicly called out on social media for not responding to constituents concerning sexual assault allegations that were posted in a Nexus article,” Sir said, later calling Mitchell out by name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I was trying to make time to work out this issue with our administration, I was harassed to the point where my personal cell phone number was in the hands of people I do not know and [who] were sending me hate mail and Facebook video chats repeatedly calling me a rapist supporter,” Sir added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir declined to take questions from senators at the end of her report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell also strongly criticized A.S. Elections Board for its recent announcement that the over 600 signatures she had already collected would not be valid due to the lack of verification, as Mitchell used a Google Form to collect signatures for the petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahead of Mitchell’s comments at public forum, Elections Board members Davis Quan and Andrew Yan detailed the remote instruction recall process that Elections Board had ratified at its latest meeting on May 15. The board also </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.app.box.com/s/d79ga8w8p4k1n2dwm3u1rcll3srssknf?fbclid=IwAR1cANfk83hiRk5T50pKwNHXS5aWSrDExMXz1dL7JRXRU7zNO3VpcZrU-j4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a statement describing the process on its Facebook page yesterday afternoon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this new reality where in-person signature collection is currently not possible, the Elections Board has had to adapt and develop an entirely new process for signature collection,” Elections Board wrote in its statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quan and Yan said the biggest reason for requiring new signatures from Mitchell was for the verification, although several senators asked Elections Board to reconsider the rules, given that Mitchell had already collected several hundred signatures and because the recall election procedures were created close to two weeks after Mitchell began circulating her petition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan and Quan remained firm about requiring verification for the signatures through a “secure university platform,” but said they would work with Mitchell to convert her already-collected signatures to the new petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, Mitchell expressed frustration at the hoops she said she was being forced to jump through and the fact that these decisions were being made by Elections Board without her involvement. She also complained that Elections Board was slow to respond to emails when she attempted to confirm that her petition was valid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senators Dagan Addinall and Giselle Etessami had tense exchanges with Mitchell during public forum, with Addinall calling Mitchell’s actions “bullying” and Etessami saying that she didn’t believe the email had asked anything of her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum, now-External Vice President for Statewide Affairs Alia Reynolds also brought up the allegation, calling Addinall and Etessami’s responses to Mitchell “atrocious.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you are actually given the opportunity to show that support [for survivors], you choose not to. You are not an ally, this is not allyship, do not call yourself an ally,” Reynolds said to the Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who lost to Beasley in the run for president, echoed Reynolds’s statement about allyship and urged senators to act in support of survivors of sexual assault at all times, not only in situations relating to A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sexual assault and rape do not discriminate. But once it’s finally at our Senate table because it’s affecting us directly, because we’re being harassed and asked to be held accountable, it’s too much?” he asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This to me is not about an office, this to me is not about A.S.,” Segura-Esquivel continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the 70th Senate’s meeting, senators broke into a closed working group to draft a statement in support of survivors, first mentioned by Mitchell in public forum and formally introduced by Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the meeting returned to open session, outgoing Internal Vice President Alli Adam confirmed that senators did write a statement, but said that it would not be released until it could be “reviewed by a few different levels of the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 70th Senate’s term officially ended at 11:35 p.m., but as former executives went to swear in their predecessors shortly afterward, the meeting was interrupted when an unknown individual wrote the words “fuck off” over the shared screen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez expressed concern about the potential Zoombombing and considered ending the Zoom meeting and creating a new link, but Adam decided to keep the meeting going and continue swearing in the executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the controversy about Beasley during the 70th Senate meeting, his swearing in came and went with little fanfare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Reynolds was being sworn in, the meeting was once again interrupted, this time by a man using sexually harassing language.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After removing the individual, now-Internal Vice President Tianna White muted all participants in the meeting as a precautionary measure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All five executives and 25 senators were sworn in by 11:59 p.m., but a few minutes after roll call, White, with the counsel of Márquez, decided to end the meeting altogether due to the “potentially traumatizing” nature of and safety threat posed by the Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given the expletives and suggestive language of the zoom bombing, I ultimately had to end the meeting to prevent any more disturbing and potentially triggering content from entering,” White wrote in a statement to the Nexus after the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to Off-Campus Senator Esmeralda Quintero — who asked that the meeting continue due to a timely legal code change — White announced that the 71st Senate would hold an additional meeting in Week 10, giving the new Senate two full meetings before breaking for the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several newly sworn-in senators, along with Mitchell, tweeted their frustration with White immediately after the meeting, expressing concern that she prevented senators from speaking or continuing with the meeting and public forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said in her statement that she will be talking to the administration about how to prevent Zoombombings for future meetings, as well as how to proceed with the agenda items slated for the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: This article has been updated to better differentiate between Senator Addinall and Senator Etessami’s comments during public forum.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

After rumors first began to spread about Beasley’s alleged inappropriate behavior, second-year communications and economics double major Izzy Mitchell created a Google Form petition to recall Beasley, which as of May 17, had over 600 unverified signatures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell needs 542 verified signatures for her petition to be valid. However, the board recently announced it will be requiring signatures to be collected through a newly created “secure university platform,” which means that any signatures that have already been collected through unofficial methods will not be considered valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under no circumstances will the AS Elections Board accept or verify any online ‘signatures’ collected through a third-party platform,” the board said in a </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.app.box.com/s/d79ga8w8p4k1n2dwm3u1rcll3srssknf?fbclid=IwAR17QBsfrUuB2Ydb9mvl3m_3W57roaQxV4NHdO8fNrrl5iKFdDVCW3VcgHc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> posted to its Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, Elections Board said it was doing so to ensure that there was a “confidential” process in place through a university-affiliated website, and that the petition itself included “legal language from AS Election Code &amp; Legal Code for any fee/recall petitions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Elections Board said the verified platform includes a “secure digital signature field” like DocuSign, and requires students to log in with their UCSB NetID to prevent duplicate signatures and ensure all signatures are from UCSB students; the new collection method would also allow administrators to more quickly verify the signatures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum at Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Mitchell criticized the board’s decision to require collection through a different platform, noting that the procedures were put in place nearly two weeks after she began circulating her petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to senators who asked Elections Board to consider compromising with Mitchell given the number of signatures she had already collected, the board told the Senate that they would work to help Mitchell convert already-collected signatures to the new platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, board members Davis Quan and Andrew Yan said the board was “scrambling” when they first learned that a recall petition had been created, which they said they only learned about after the Nexus reached out on May 4 asking for information regarding recall procedures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the board itself does not meet outside of election season, the board had considered election season over and had already begun to disperse by the time the petition was released, Quan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Legal Code does not specify how to conduct a recall election, only that 20% of the student body must vote and that two-thirds of those students must vote yes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For typical recall petitions, signatures are collected in-person and on clipboards; Quan said Elections Board tried to mimic in-person procedures when determining how a recall petition and election would work during remote instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Mitchell’s petition receives enough verified signatures, the 71st Senate must vote on the petition twice — once to ratify the petition results, which Elections Board referred to as a “procedural vote,” and then to call for a recall election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two-thirds of the 71st Senate must vote in favor in order for a recall election to be held in Fall Quarter 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the vote passes, the fall quarter election, which the board anticipates would be held in the first few weeks of the quarter, will only have one question on the ballot that will ask if students want to recall Beasley. If students vote in favor of recalling Beasley, Quan said a special election to elect a new president would likely take place in Winter Quarter 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that if Beasley is recalled, there is no language in Legal Code that would prevent him from running again in the special election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan said they had looked to previous recall elections in the state of California as precedent to determine if they would hold one election both for the recall vote and Beasley’s replacement, or two separate elections; ultimately, they decided that despite potential voter fatigue, they didn’t want people campaigning for the presidency ahead of the recall vote itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 2018-19 academic year, Elections Board held two special elections to fill the position of external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA), both of which </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/about-2-2-percent-of-student-body-has-voted-in-evpsa-special-election/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed to meet the voter threshold</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the election to be considered valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, there was no EVPSA for the 2018-19 academic year, although many of the job duties were </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-redistributing-honoraria-to-evpsa-office-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fulfilled by other individuals and organizations.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Beasley is recalled but the special election to fill the position of president does not meet the voter threshold, Yan said that the position would not go unfilled. Unlike the EVPSA position, there is a line of succession for A.S. President in Legal Code, which says that the Internal Vice President (IVP) will serve as acting president until a new one can be elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current IVP is third-year political science major Tianna White, who was sworn in on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has only been one previous recall movement in recent A.S. history. In 2014, students attempted to recall External Vice President for Local Affairs-elect Beatrice Contreras, who was accused at the time of sexual assault. The petition to recall Contreras did not receive enough signatures; however, Contreras </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/two-associated-students-politicians-abdicate-positions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">later resigned from office</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
