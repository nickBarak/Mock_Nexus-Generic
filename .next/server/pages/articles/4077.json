Alex Schrier, Jorge Arellano Jr. (although he was removed from the game after allowing a walk), Conner Dand, Charlie Adamson and Carter Benbrook all stepped on and off the mound without surrendering a run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB won the series with Saturday’s win, but the third game was just as important. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head coach Andrew Checketts handed the ball to Michael McGreevy, whose brilliance also shone in his last start against Sacramento State. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, he didn’t disappoint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight down by way of the K and McGreevy went eight, but the Wildcats cracked the code for the first time all weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conner Roberts, who had been a central figure in this cast, was hit for 4 runs, and ACU would go on to win it 5-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a comeback, a 3-run comeback to be precise, but Colby Adkins would ultimately hold on for the save.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will play both a one-game match against LMU and a three-game series against the University of Illinois at Chicago this week, two teams that have a combined 3-12 record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the only time the Gauchos take on the Flames this season, but the match against LMU will be a part of a three-game series taking place later this season. It’s looking like a little bit of a preview for both sides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering Benbrook came out of the bullpen recently, it’s hard to tell whether he’ll start tomorrow’s game. He started the game after McGreevy in the last go around but coughed up six runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB just so happened to win that game 17-7. That was the first game under the lights. Did you need another reminder? No. Is it still exciting? Yes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lions are 3-5 on the season and won each of those games by a combined score of 20-5. Needless to say, the Gauchos will be kicking themselves if they find that they’ve underestimated their opponents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Flames will come to town for a three-game series starting this Friday. It’s a bit too early to tell who will start, but look to McGreevy and Torra for some head-spinning action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First pitch is at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow, while Friday’s game is set for 5:30 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The key ingredient to Boone’s success on Saturday was his changeup, with Boone generating 18 swings and misses on his secondary pitch.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coach talked to me about throwing my changeup to look like a fastball and to keep my arm speed good on my off-speed,” Boone told KCSB’s Max Kelton after the game, when asked about the effectiveness of the pitch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did a freshman pitcher — one who merely throws for average velocity — pitch the game that clinched the Gauchos their first conference title in 33 years? Part of the answer lies with a slim, self-described nerd by the name of Tony Ortiz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of enjoying the title with the team on Saturday, Ortiz was perched high up in the bleachers, recording every single pitch and swing during the game — just as he’s done all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite only being a third-year, Ortiz has flourished this year as the Undergraduate Analytics Manager for the UCSB baseball team. Since 2017 — when former Director of Analytics Evan Short took over the position — UCSB has become the most analytically driven baseball program on the West Coast. Short pushed the coaching staff to raise the money to ensure that Santa Barbara has state-of-the-art equipment, including tools like TrackMan and Rapsodo that major league teams use for their statistics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, however, Short received an offer to help build the Toronto Blue Jays’ analytics department — an offer too good to turn down. After two years of revolutionizing Santa Barbara’s analytics usage, Short left for Major League Baseball, leaving a gaping hole for the baseball program to fill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter Ortiz.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Ortiz first joined the baseball staff last year, he was a baseball operations intern, helping out with whatever he could around the office. But when Short knew he was leaving, he began to groom Ortiz to take over his role with the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At first, I was only occasionally working with [Short], and it was more on the baseball side of things because I didn’t have the experience with statistics or programming,” Ortiz said. “Towards the end, however, I was writing reports to provide to the coaches so they had more information about what the players needed to work on during the season.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a team of four interns at his disposal, Ortiz’s main job is to be the liaison between the hard data and the coaching staff, turning the code written by his interns into easily interpretable and digestible bites for the coaches to understand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes my interns will come up with a report, and it will still be marked with the code they wrote,” Ortiz said. “I love seeing how they did it, but when it comes to giving it to the coaching staff, I tell them we need to get rid of all of that and just get to the point.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somehow, Ortiz manages to juggle his responsibilities as Undergraduate Analytics Manager with being a full-time statistics student at UCSB. In a typical day, Ortiz will go to the baseball office to upload and analyze videos, go to class and then head to the stadium to record statistics for the live bullpen sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The interns have been extremely helpful in my adjustment to this position,” Ortiz said. “It’s really nice to be able to rely on them for help, because it gives me more time to do the actual analysis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite his packed schedule, Ortiz thrives because of his unmitigated love for the sport of baseball. Before I could even ask  my first question prior to the game on Saturday, Ortiz unpacked the Gauchos’ devastating loss on Friday to me, explaining how UCSB’s high-risk, high reward-style offense ultimately backfired. While he uses some data in his analysis, Ortiz makes it clear that his love for baseball stretches beyond just a trendline or chart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think all the time that if I could play, I would give up all the analytic stuff to play just because I love the game that much,” Ortiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his passion and his drive, Ortiz has seamlessly filled in for Short, supplying data and analysis to the coaching staff whenever he can. Perhaps most importantly, the coaching staff has directly utilized the analysis Ortiz and his team provide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a more traditional game like baseball, some pundits and coaches are apprehensive to turn the game over to hard data and numbers. But under the direction of Head Coach Andrew Checketts, UCSB has wholeheartedly embraced the data revolution in baseball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coach Checketts and the coaching staff are very reasonable, and if they see something with evidence, they are going to take it and run with it,” Ortiz said. “The coaches have their own ideas of what the players should work on, and then they can use the analytics as support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, a data analytics team is nothing if the players themselves don’t buy in and aren’t willing to learn from data rather than relying on raw intuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps no player has embraced data as much as Boone has in his first year at Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Boone is a perfect example of a player where you can’t see how good he is until you look at his analytics numbers,” Ortiz said. “He’s not a flamethrower, but he has a wrinkle on his fastball — a little movement — that makes it harder to hit than just a regular fastball.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boone came into Santa Barbara without a plus fastball, but the analytics team broke down videos in the offseason to try to help the coaches develop his secondary pitches, including his changeup — the very changeup that played a vital role in Boone’s start on Saturday. Despite being completely behind-the-scenes, those video breakdowns ended up helping UCSB take home the Big West title for the first time in 33 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Ortiz’s main goals for next season is to incorporate more video and advanced statistics into the offensive side of things for the Gauchos. After putting most of his time and resources into helping the pitching staff, however, the results speak for themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, UCSB has pitched to a 3.21 ERA this season while racking up 491 strikeouts as a pitching staff, four strikeouts away from breaking the school’s single season record, which will likely be broken during the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve really built a culture here where the pitching staff has completely bought in on the analytics,” Ortiz said. “Like the Astros and Rays [in the pros], it’s just become a mindset with our team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He may never get the credit he deserves, but Ortiz has played an integral role in the Gauchos’ 45-9 season — the best record in program history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If the Gauchos can make it to Omaha, Ortiz will be ready, boxplot in one hand, Rapsodo in the other, to help the coaching staff bring a title back to Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s average response rate is under 50%, below the national response rate of about 60% and Santa Barbara County’s overall self-response rate of about 64%, according to the United States Census 2020 website. I.V. is divided into three census tracts, which are subdivisions in each county used in the counting process; I.V.’s three tracts divide the unincorporated district into strips perpendicular to the ocean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has been designated a hard-to-count community. This was before the pandemic,” Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said I.V.’s young population already made gathering census responses in the community challenging. With the pandemic forcing social distancing regulations and</span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the retreat of Santa Barbara Community College and UC Santa Barbara students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, educating  I.V. residents and conducting typical census outreach has been complicated. If response rates remain low, the community risks losing crucial funding, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether or not people are counted in our community will affect a ton of different government and education-related programs for funding and how much funding Isla Vista and the UCSB area receives,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the census affect a decade’s worth of congressional representation and federal funding in communities, which could go toward projects ranging from infrastructure and highways to school lunches and special education, according to the </span><a href=\"https://2020census.gov/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Census website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normal deadlines and operations in the census project have been extended due to complications from the coronavirus pandemic, and the I.V. CSD is looking for volunteers to start calling households as part of the next phase of the census tracking, according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a similar point in the 2010 U.S. Census, I.V.’s response rate was about 60%, according to the I.V. CSD website. None of the three census tracts in Isla Vista have reached 50% as of May 26, and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“undercount of this magnitude would severely negatively impact Isla Vista’s funding until the year 2030,” according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”We’re gonna employ every effort that we possibly can to try to get the word out to people,” Brandt said. “The biggest thing that residents can do if they’re concerned about the population is … spread the word to still get counted in Isla Vista [and] don’t get counted at your parents house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite students’ return to their hometowns, the U.S. Census Bureau said students should respond as if they were at their normal place of residence in I.V. Students normally living in on-campus housing are automatically counted in the census through the university. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
