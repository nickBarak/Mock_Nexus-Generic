But these national events weren’t just headlines to the students of UCSB; at the time, male college-aged students were being drafted in droves for the Vietnam War, the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill saw an outage that would later lead to the modern environmental movement and four college students had been killed by National Guard soldiers during an anti-war protest at Kent State in Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista quickly became a countercultural hub, in part because of the high student population and small-town nature that made the area a breeding ground for political activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just felt like the country was on the verge of a revolution. It was easier to feel that way when we’re all in a center of a refuge of like-minded people like here in Isla Vista,” Steve Byrd, who attended UCSB between 1965 and 1970, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The anti-war movement at UCSB and Isla Vista differentiated from movements at other universities during the period, Byrd said, in part because of the violent tensions that led to the burning of the local Bank of America building, the death of a student by the hands of police and the deployment of the national guard by then-governor Ronald Reagan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd, a senior at the time, had a front row seat for it all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He described the hippie movement in the area as “peaceful” — at least until January 1970. The rest of the 1969-1970 academic year was marked by three distinctive phases of rioting, culminating in June with the arrival of the National Guard and the arrest of 10% of Isla Vista’s population one week before final exams, Byrd said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event that sparked the violence of 1970 is arguably the most nationally well-known event in the university’s history: the burning of the Bank of America building in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The government was continuing the same old way … they just wouldn’t change. They just kept on doing the same thing, kept on being involved in the same imperialistic overseas wars, no matter how much people protest it. At the time, the Bank of America … it came out they had extensive investments in the Vietnam War and profiteering off the Vietnam War.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90136\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/katherine-swartz_portrait_online_1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90136\" data-attachment-id=\"90136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/katherine-swartz_portrait_online_1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1463&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1463\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Katherine Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90136\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katherine-Swartz_portrait_ONLINE_1.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90136\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd stands in front of Embarcadero Hall, the former location of the Bank of America building that burned down in 1970. </span><em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A crowd of “a few hundred” gathered around the Bank of America building in Isla Vista, the current site of Embarcadero Hall. They broke windows, grabbed furniture out of the building and made a large pile, lighting it on fire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately, police from surrounding towns were brought in the area, and Byrd remembers their “aggressive” behavior toward all of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They didn’t know Isla Vista at all, they just knew the stereotypes and they were pissed off. They were pissed off to be here and maybe fearful and scared and they became very aggressive with us, very, very aggressive with us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After three days, students “ran [the police] out of town,” according to Byrd. But the violence of 1970 was far from over. Just a couple months later, in mid-April, police killed UCSB student Kevin Moran who went to help put out fires started by rioters. Moran shouted, “Don’t shoot at us — we’re putting the fire out!” according to El Gaucho, a former version of the Daily Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Byrd, police initially tried to blame Moran’s death on student snipers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They told all the students snipers had done it for the first several days and things like that. And then it only came out out over time that the police were the one who had actually done it. But then the thing was [the officer] was never indicted for it. He was never indicted even for negligent manslaughter or anything,” Byrd said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He never had to answer for anything in the criminal justice system, which I guess was real typical. That didn’t set too well, back then at all either.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violence between police and students continued to escalate at college campuses across the country, inflaming already strained tensions at UCSB. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90134\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/screen-shot-2019-10-02-at-9-33-25-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90134\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90134\" data-attachment-id=\"90134\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/50-years-isla-vistas-role-in-the-countercultural-revolution/screen-shot-2019-10-02-at-9-33-25-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?fit=876%2C1270&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"876,1270\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-02 at 9.33.25 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?fit=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?fit=706%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-90134\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=311%2C451\" alt=\"\" width=\"311\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?w=876&amp;ssl=1 876w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=172%2C250&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=768%2C1113&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.33.25-PM.png?resize=706%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus archives</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd remembers that he and his friends were stopped by police on a daily basis. This stemmed from a deeper distrust he observed between the older and younger generations during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used to get stopped by the police all the time, you know, just for being young, just for being counter-cultural looking a little bit. I really noticed the difference now that I get older, because I’m just not stopped for no reason like I was when I was young.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During an especially tumultuous period at the end of June, right before finals, over 1,000 people were arrested in Isla Vista for violating a temporary curfew, including Byrd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd recounted his own experience of being arrested for being out past curfew, describing the “aggressive” nature of policing at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The police would go and start ‘bam, bam, bam’ on your apartment door. They’d knocked down the door and to smithereens. And they’d bust in and people would be hiding underneath their beds and in the shower in the bathroom. They’d come and then they say you’re violating curfew after they yanked them outside of their own house and then take them away to jail.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd said he was held overnight with “40 people in a cell for four people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were just crammed in like sardines into a cell where you couldn’t even lay down or even hardly sit down,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were violating the Constitution. They were inflicting punishment before trial, before being found guilty, just inflicting their own revenge kind of punishment on arrest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perceptions of Byrd and students at the time weren’t reflected in the national media coverage over the course of the 1969-1970 year; a New York Times column published in August 1970 described Isla Vista as a “ghetto,” blaming students for the violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The mere words ‘University of California’ on the ballot, in the current public mood, would probably doom a modest subsidy to cure cancer,” columnist Winthrop Griffith wrote at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd believes the media focused solely on the violence, ignoring the peaceful protesting of students and deep political values against the war that motivated their actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a stereotype that sold newspapers. It’s so media, you know, it’s the way the news media always is. They write up the sensationalistic thing to get readership up. And by stirring the pot, by making the young people into the troublemakers and everything, it’s just a stereotype that most older people had,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw the value of the counter cultural revolution, that peace and love and anti-militarism or values, that were worth pursuing, not just because we were young, but they were lifelong values that were worth pursuing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This five year-period of history of UCSB’s, and the nation’s country, may as well be a snapshot in history — a time when the country was at war and the culture was rapidly changing. Isla’s Vista’s student-dominant environment stood out against the landscape of Goleta and Santa Barbara, where adults looked down on the “hippie” look and lifestyle of UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All the young people clustered here and they feel like this was their safe space, in Isla Vista,” Byrd said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first came to Isla Vista in 1965, it was a very different place, almost a 1950s preppy place. Then it changed just in a couple of years to this big hippie revolution and all the countercultural revolution.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The Roadrunners, now owners of a 20-16 overall record, got ahead with an early start, but the Gauchos would answer back and hold their lead due to a much-needed stellar performance from their bullpen.</p>\n<p>On the mound for UCSB was big lefty Ben Brecht. After going seven Innings pitched in his last start against Pepperdine, Brecht would only go four innings against the Roadrunners giving up six hits and four earned runs altogether for a no decision in the contest.</p>\n<p>The true freshman was shaken up early on in the first inning after giving up a leadoff double and two more base hits, which would lead to two runs off the young lefty.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brecht, who had decent stuff in his outing, would come out for a much needed 1-2-3 frame before giving up one more run off a sacrifice fly from the second baseman David Metzgar in the third frame. In the fourth, senior shortstop Ryan Grotjohn would lead off the inning with a hustle double on a bloop to left field. Despite this, Brecht held the Roadrunners to one run, making the score 4-0 after the top half of the frame.</p>\n<p>Even though this was not the start the Gauchos wanted from their young pitcher, the bats would pick up Brecht their young pitcher. In the bottom of the fourth, the Gauchos would finally get to Bakersfield own freshman pitcher Mathew Seibert.</p>\n<p>With one out in the inning, the sixth hole hitter senior outfielder Billy Fredrick would get things going with a perfectly back-spun base-hit line drive to centerfield. Next, freshman outfielder Armani Smith would single up the middle right after Fredrick to knock out the right-handed Seibert. The reliever turned starter for the day would have a predictable short outing going only 3.1 IP with no strikeouts and giving up two earned runs.</p>\n<p>However, even his relief pitcher, freshman Kenny Johnson could not stop UCSB from its big inning. JJ Muno would find barrel, singling through the left side. With back to back to back hits, the Gauchos had the bases loaded with only one out.</p>\n<p>Eric Yang, the freshman catcher had the table set for his first collegiate hit to be a big one. Yang, although not getting a hit, would still get the job done hitting a high chopper to third not allowing a double play or a throw home to get the force out. The freshman catcher would get thrown out at first but a run would score.</p>\n<p>The most clutch at bat of the day though would come next in the form of Colton Burns. The junior second baseman would come through with a two out double roped into the left center gap scoring both Smith and Muno making the score 4-3 through four complete.</p>\n<p>In relief for Brecht, the true freshman righty Chris Lincoln would come in with some swagger to sit down Roadrunner batters. The pitcher who models his game after the late Yodano Ventura, came in and let it be known to the Gaucho coaching staff that they can have some faith in their youthful bullpen after a couple shaky outings.</p>\n<p>Lincoln had his A+ stuff, wooing the crowd with his electric fastball and Wiffle ball-esque slider. The lengthy righty with an impressive pitcher’s build would go 3.1 IP giving up only two hits with as many strikeouts. Moving forward, especially after this outing, Lincoln could be a potential starter in future years for the Chos.</p>\n<p>To back up a dominant bullpen performance from Lincoln, the Gauchos would continue to score runs as the game went on.  During the sixth, reliever Malik Jones who oddly enough DH’d for Bakersfield in the game as well, balked in a run, scoring Armani Smith.</p>\n<p>In the seventh though Austin “Big Daddy” Bush would make people understand why his nickname is “Big Daddy.”  The Gaucho four hitter would hit a ball, not only over the first fence in right field, but over a second set of fences protecting transformers as well for a solo homerun. To simply put it, Bush didn’t just get a piece of it; he got the whole thing and disgraced the Ball’s entire family with one swing. The statement making go ahead home run from Bush would completely deflate the CSUB dugout and put all the air into the sails of UCSB.</p>\n<p>JJ Muno would score the last run of the game for the Chos, giving a huge insurance run for UCSB. After a walk, Muno would wreak havoc on the base paths. With the offensive mindset of run-until-they-tag-ya, Muno would steal second and then steal third.  While stealing third the throw from Bakersfield catcher Jake Oliver would short hop third baseman Brandon Heinrich and shoot into left field. Muno would score easy and manufacture a run in the most Pete Rose way possible.</p>\n<p>With a two run lead, Shea Barry would come in to close it out for the Chos and had little trouble. Barry would continue to show why he is the most accountable pitcher to call on out of the pin by ending the game with a big strike out with a runner scoring position.  The righty would collect his third save of the year and lower his team leading ERA to 2.53. The final score: 6 to 4 UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 14-9 at home this season.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara has won six of its last ten, but its last four wins have been a bit too close for comfort, with only a one to three run difference in the final score.</p>\n<p>But to their advantage, they trump Riverside in just about every offensive statistical category, leading UCR overall as a team in runs, hits, home runs, RBIs, walks, and stolen bases with a collective .277 batting average over the Highlanders .249 team average.</p>\n<p>Individually, UCSB junior Austin Bush is tied for first in Big West home runs at nine so far with CSUN junior Albee Weiss and is sitting at second, following Weiss, in conference RBIs with 32. Bush is one of the Gauchos biggest power hitters as the team leader in RBIs and home runs, along with sophomore Sam Cohen who is slugging .529 just above Bush’s .517 percentage.</p>\n<p>From Riverside, freshman Connor Cannon is behind Bush and Weiss in Big West homers with seven, putting the pitcher and first baseman for the Highlanders at second in a three-way tie with UC Irvine junior Keston Hiura and CSUN redshirt junior Kevin Riley. Other than Cannon, who also leads his team in RBIs, there is no one else from UCR is leading individually in conference hitting stats.</p>\n<p>Another Highlander for the Gauchos pitching staff and defense to tread lightly with at the dish is Mark Contreras, who is leading his team with a batting average of .402 and a mighty slugging percentage of .598.</p>\n<p>Regarding defense on the diamond, UC Riverside has been just slightly tighter and cleaner than UCSB this year with a .967 fielding percentage and eight fewer errors than the Gauchos line of defense, which has produced a .962 fielding percentage.</p>\n<p>On the mound, though, UCSB comes out on top with a combined 4.72 ERA to the Highlanders 5.50 ERA, also having allowed 25 less total earned runs, 39 fewer walks, and 14 more strikeouts than the UCR pitching staff.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams challenged each other was at the end of the 2016 season, in which the Highlanders grabbed the three-game series from the Gauchos with two wins at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p>Based on the subpar offensive and pitching statistics on behalf of UCR in comparison to those of UCSB, this could be an opportunity for the Gauchos to take advantage of their opponent’s larger weaknesses at the plate and on the hill to improve both their conference and overall records back to the .500 mark, or above, if they can execute two victories this weekend.</p>\n<p>However, as a disclaimer, previous statistical analysis cannot predict anything that will happen within nine innings of baseball.</p>\n<p>So although this is a team performing below average thus far, it does not mean that the Highlanders cannot defy expectations and start performing anomalous to their recent battles to keep it interesting.</p>\n<p>If there is anything a baseball player, coach, or fan can expect, it would be to not have any expectations. We can paint a pretty picture based on statistics and think about who should win, but it’s rarely the case that those statistics consistently and accurately translate what can happen, who could be the catalyst or the hero, or which team will end up taking the win.</p>\n<p>The series kicks off at 6 p.m. on Friday at Riverside Sports Complex, with another 6 p.m. evening game on Saturday, and an afternoon Sunday game at 1 p.m. to round out the series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77453\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77453\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/ucsb-travels-to-face-struggling-uc-riverside/","id":4129,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4128,4127,4126],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

CSD), because it is a public entity to provide officers for any large event, regardless of any separate private security hired for the event, according to Brandt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but the district would like to minimize the police presence at the festival, he said, as simply seeing officers in uniform could be potentially unsettling for people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that cracking down and forcing and arresting and ticketing our way of public safety is not possible,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That just drives a wedge between law enforcement and the community and we can’t go down that road again. We saw what happened in 2014, there was a riot and we can’t go back to that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman called the proposed contract with SBSO — which he said could potentially raise costs for the district </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “an endless pit of liabilities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract includes an “indemnification” clause, which would require the I.V. CSD to agree to “indemnify, defend and hold harmless [the] COUNTY … against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, and/or liabilities,” according to the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman raised concerns that should a situation arise in which the SBSO would need to bring in more officers, costs would rise for the I.V. CSD. However, according to G. Ross Trindle, district counsel for the I.V. CSD, the possibility is very low for a situation in which the I.V. CSD would be at fault for the actions of SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow also mentioned concerns from SBSO leadership about the timeline of putting together the festival. At the I.V. Safe Task Force meeting held earlier that day, he said SBSO leadership did not believe that holding the festival this year “is the right path to take.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[SBSO’s] position on this is ‘wait until next year. It’s too soon and there’s plenty of time for us to get on the same page,’” Thurlow said at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract negotiations have been ongoing for over </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a month</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now; the proposal was originally brought to the I.V. CSD in early October. Sara Marvel, director for Lucidity LLC, emphasized a month ago the importance of approving the contract in a week to get all the moving pieces ready in time for spring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half of the board seemed to be seriously considering the possibility of pushing the festival until 2021, although Brandt was adamant that appropriate adjustments could be made to the contract in time for it to be passed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman stressed the timeliness of the contract as well, adding that pushing the festival to the following year would give the board more time to finalize contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A month ago we had a meeting and we were talking about these contracts and how we’re going to handle it. It was, essentially, if you don’t get the contract done right now, we won’t have enough time and that was a month [ago] and we still don’t have the contract done, it’s not going to happen until weeks from now,” Freeman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think we’re able to pull this off right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janet, a resident of I.V. for eight years who attended Tuesday’s meeting, echoed Freeman’s thoughts, stating that she believed that changing the culture around Deltopia could not be done in a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So as far as the goals go, which is to change the atmosphere of Deltopia, it has to be a multi-year project. It’s not going to happen in one year. You have to think out a little bit farther because it will be a gradual process,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
