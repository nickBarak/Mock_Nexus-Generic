The Sheriff’s Office partially attributed smaller crowds to the efforts of I.V. residents to defer out-of-towners from coming into their homes and parties. Other factors contributing to the decrease in attendees, according to the Sheriff’s Office, include the university’s efforts, student-only activities, over 100 police officers from across UC campuses and assistance from law enforcement agencies from the surrounding counties. According to the Sheriff’s Office, the county festival ordinance prohibiting music after 6 p.m. and restricting parking on certain streets in I.V. and Goleta was “instrumental” in reducing the crowd size.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated. – Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the 50 percent decrease in attendance from last year, the Sheriff’s Office stated the number of arrests and citations remained high because of increased presence of law enforcement. Preliminary numbers provided by the Sheriff’s Office count 140 citations and 102 arrests issued, compared to 190 citations and 130 arrests during last year’s Deltopia. Medical incidents this year also decreased significantly with only nine medical transports reported compared to 50 in 2014.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason said in an email the crowds this past weekend were more manageable compared to last year.</p>\n<p>“The crowds were smaller and more respectful than last year,” Eliason said in an email. “On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason, the calmer crowds were in part due to the planning and coordination that began months prior to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think the tremendous planning and coordinated effort by everyone affiliated with the event helped to make it more enjoyable than last year,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the number of arrests and citations were a reflection of the saturation of police within I.V. and not necessarily of a reckless student body.</p>\n<p>“Keep in mind that there were over 300 police officers in a one square mile radius,” Schunk said. “If you have a bunch of people in an area drinking, there are going to be people who are committing crimes. If you have hundreds more police officers, then the rate at which those people who are committing even minor nonviolent offensives, there is a higher chance that there will be a police officer nearby.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property. – Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said he agreed the coordinated efforts demonstrated a sense of ownership by I.V. locals for the event.</p>\n<p>“I noticed a lot of cooperation amongst different entities in order to really take ownership of the event and provide structure,” Schunk said. “UCIV, the campus, IVFP, UCPD, and Life of the Party … There was a sense that this was more than just some wild street party that got out of control automatically.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, if this trend of community involvement continues he believes extra policing will not be necessary at future Deltopia weekends.</p>\n<p>“I think even police officers resonated with that and it helped them show a little more restraint,” Schunk said. “I think over time we could see the level of necessary policing decrease more and more as we add in that structure that helps support the event.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said to continue positive progress for a safer Deltopia, he hopes to see more focus on the student volunteer program University of California Isla Vista (UCIV), which helped facilitate Deltopia and the lawful conduction of festivities this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think really the thing I would love to see targeted and expanded upon next year is the UCIV program. And the idea of student volunteers,” Schunk said. “The reception generally was incredibly favorable. Countless people came up to us and said, ‘Thank you so much for taking your time today to hand out water bottles.’ People were almost incredulous.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr said he understands the need for police action during Deltopia and hopes the event will gradually return to a smaller party meant for I.V. locals.</p>\n<p>“I think the intimidation from the sheer number of police this Deltopia was one of the only benefits of mass law enforcement,” Foehr said. “My 300 person party getting shut down at 3:00 p.m. at the time it seemed unnecessary, but it was for the general welfare and I understand that. I feel that next year’s Deltopia will be more local and back to normal like before the [2014] riots because of this intimidating police presence.”</p>\n<p>Foehr also said he believed the increased police presence had some disadvantages.</p>\n<p>“However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property,” Foehr said. “Also, it’s a waste of public resources to have so many cops here, just because of irresponsible college kids.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Nehanda Wells attended Deltopia this past weekend and said she also experienced a run-in with the police, but the incident did not change her opinion on the positive aspects of additional policing.</p>\n<p>“Outside BevMo! … a cop banged on my window and asked to see my ID. I’ve never had that happen before. It was intimidating because I wasn’t doing anything wrong,” Wells said. “I’m not saying that it was a bad thing. I just think that was reaching too far. But as far as having more police here for the weekend, it obviously worked because things were much calmer this year than last year.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

college students, plans to open a new sober living facility on Pasado Road in Isla Vista next year called The Haven at Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Haven at College, which has already established residences in college towns for USC, Drexel University and the University of Redlands, will house seven students in I.V. seeking to live substance-free lifestyles. The Haven at Santa Barbara would not be a university program, but Gauchos for Recovery and the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program plan to largely endorse the project.</p>\n<p>According to The Haven at College co-founder Holly Sherman, The Haven will open its doors in July and thus far has one student committed to living there. Although The Haven is currently “working on the math,” Sherman said the cost of staying at this sober living house will be roughly higher than living in an on-campus dorm.</p>\n<p>“There is an additional fee for the services we provide,” Sherman said. “It’s a little above the cost of room and board at a dorm.”</p>\n<p>Sherman said students living at The Haven will be treated with peer support programs and clinician care in order to facilitate effective recovery and ensure a healthy environment for residents.</p>\n<p>“We are a supportive group,” Sherman said. “The most practical measure is that it’s run by students — we hire students who are great role models of recovery.”<br>\nThe Haven at College co-founder Sharon Weber said The Haven at Santa Barbara was established through connections made with the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program after working with the UC Office of the President in the fall.</p>\n<p>“We had been in dialogue with the UC system and it was through that exposure that we met some of the people involved in the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program at UCSB,” Weber said. “They were the ones that invited us to come up and engage in some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program director Jackie Kurta, she first heard of The Haven at College when she picked up educational literature about the program at a conference in the fall. Kurta said establishing a sober living facility in I.V. seemed like “good timing,” given the difficult past year and changing attitude of I.V. towards safety and health.</p>\n<p>“It felt to me like this would be a wonderful opportunity for us here in Isla Vista,” Kurta said. “We contacted them and they were very enthusiastic, and they really were very interested in checking out the possibilities here.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said she favors the recovery program administered at The Haven at College because it is specifically catered toward college students seeking to abstain from drug and alcohol use.</p>\n<p>“Their program is just such an excellent one,” Kurta said. “It really takes into consideration the specific needs of students in a college setting, as opposed to another traditional sober living facility which serves a kind of broad spectrum of ages and lifestyles.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, The Haven at Santa Barbara will act as a supportive body to aid students seeking to refrain from substance abuse rather than as a “policing body.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t have anything against drugs and alcohol; we believe they have their place in the college life,” Weber said. “But if you have a problem with them and they’re kicking your ass, then you’re welcome to come to The Haven at Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>UCLA alumnus Danny Buchan said he has been living at The Haven at USC for two years since seeking recovery from his drug addiction and is now four years clean.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t do something, I would have died, or much less be able to go to school or live a constructive life, so I went to treatment and I got into recovery,” Buchan said. “Now that I’ve gone into recovery, I can enjoy life at the moment and be more connected to the world and people around me.”</p>\n<p>Buchan said he works as The Haven at USC house manager, where he administers recovery practices such as weekly 12-step programs, frequent breathalyzing, random urine tests and a temporary curfew.</p>\n<p>“There are accountability measures that we have just to assure the safety of The Haven and to make sure that everyone is staying sober and that everyone’s on the right track,” Buchan said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61386\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/housing-organization-offers-substance-free-living-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61386\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/housing-organization-offers-substance-free-living-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/housing-organization-offers-substance-free-living-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/housing-organization-offers-substance-free-living-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/housing-organization-offers-substance-free-living-in-i-v/","id":4745,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4744,4743,4742],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Clean Up I.V.

Trash-collectors concluded the clean-up by watching the sun set along the I.V. coastline.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major and outreach and education coordinator for the Coastal Fund Kylie Taylor said it is important to clean I.V. beaches regularly because of the university research conducted in these areas.</p>\n<p>“We like to clean the beach as much as we can – at least once a quarter at minimum,” Taylor said. “Our organization is so focused on funding research projects in the coastline. It is important to our statement and values to keep it clean as we help people do their research in the coastal regions of Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Taylor also said alcohol-related activities increase local waste in the ocean – specifically by allowing broken glass, bottles and cans to collect on the beach.</p>\n<p>“Some of it can be blamed on alcohol,” Taylor said. “You can see broken glass in the streets of Isla Vista that gets transferred onto the beach. Some students also toss bottles and cans into the sand area after playing Frisbee. We want to get rid of these wastes as much as we can because we know that alcohol can be a factor in making the beaches dirtier.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Alex Germann attended the beach clean-up and said it made him feel like he was “making a difference … especially after a Friday night.”</p>\n<p>“After cleaning the ocean, I definitely feel good about myself – as an individual and that I helped out the community,” Germann said.</p>\n<p>According to Germann, conducting a quarterly beach clean-up not only benefits the environment, but also has positive implications for safety.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the mess, I feel like it is not done on purpose, but sometimes it tends to happen,” Germann said. “If we volunteer to help and clean up, it is actually better for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major and Coastal Fund outreach and education coordinator Kevin Lou said the beach was not a big part of his life prior to attending the university, but that, after moving to the area, he has learned that the ocean has a lot to offer to the community.</p>\n<p>“Before coming out to UCSB, I [lived] too far from the coast so it was not a big part of my life,” Lou said. “But, after moving here it is definitely a big part of every person’s life here from the environment to activities in the spring like going to the beach and watching the sunsets.”</p>\n<p>According to Lou, this beach clean-up differs from previous endeavors in that it took place in the late afternoon instead of the conventional early morning start, allowing volunteers to watch the sunset after clean-up.</p>\n<p>“We, as a group, thought it would be interesting to host this event in the afternoon to see the sunset at the end of the clean-up,” Lou said. “Instead of having it in the morning, we assumed that students do not want to wake up early in the morning in hopes of having a bigger turnout.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Mark Butello said he moved to Isla Vista in 1982 and has been participating in beach clean-ups ever since.</p>\n<p>“I used to walk up and down the beaches with a friend back in 1982 when I got here from Los Angeles,” Butello said. “We would gather up trash and clean it thoroughly.

UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa began the event by taking questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. would have no direct effect on law enforcement in the area.</p>\n<p>“The county is still responsible for law enforcement in this area. What [it would do] though is give the community a voice as far as communicating with the Sheriff’s department, the university police department [and] the university as a whole [as well as] the county as a whole,” Signa said. “It [would give] them more of a voice to say, ‘Hey, this is what we’re looking for. This is the problem we’re having.’”</p>\n<p>Signa also discussed the university’s $70,000 grant to put up fencing along the cliffs. According to Signa, the project received unanimous support because of its promise to improve the safety of residents.</p>\n<p>“The only people that don’t want it are the people say ‘It blocks my view’ or something like that. But everybody else is very much in favor of it,” Signa said. “You got people dying over something like that and it could be easily remedied by a fence.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61442\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1385995212\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61439\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61442\" data-attachment-id=\"61442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/pizza-with-a-cop_john-clow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424974568\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pizza With a Cop_John Clow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61442\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow-250x167.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Students listen on as Sargent Sigma answers student questions.

John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When asked about prominent crime issues this year, Signa said similar to previous years, almost all arrests and violations can be credited to drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the stats, 95 percent of the people that are arrested are arrested for things involving alcohol,” Signa said. “It’s unfortunate it’s such a party atmosphere out here the amount of alcohol really affects the safety of people.”</p>\n<p>Signa also said in recent years the violence he has seen in I.V. has become “intense.”</p>\n<p>“This shouldn’t be a town where you have stabbings; you shouldn’t have fights where people are going to hospitals, and it’s frustrating to see that,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, the decreasing crime rates in I.V. are partially a result of the increased presence of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Now, like I mentioned before, the presence … it’s helped. It’s a Band-Aid. It helps fix some of the problems, but it’s not the solution,” Signa said. “We still need to come up with a solution for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Signa said students and residents should not be paranoid about falling victim to a crime, but should also be cautious that I.V. does have a very high crime rate.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing for me — what I want to tell the students and residents, everybody that lives out here — is just watch out for each other,” Signa said. “We’re a community, and community is about taking care of each other.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year physics major Zoltan Urge, the event was well organized and gave I.V. residents an opportunity to connect to local law enforcement in a personal manner.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good outreach to students because recently there’s been a bunch of backlash against the police and this is a good way to reconnect with the community,” Urge said.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Oliver Fahrner approves of the job local law enforcement is doing and said he wishes there were a better way to deal with out-of-town visitors.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any complaints about the officers or law enforcement,” Fahrner said. “My main complaint about Isla Vista is that I wish there was an actual, solid way to combat out-of-towners. I wish there was a way to keep out-of-towners out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/","id":4747,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4746,4745,4744],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
