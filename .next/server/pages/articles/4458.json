The UCSB baseball team walked off in the bottom of the ninth inning for the second time in just over a week. Last Sunday, junior left fielder Joey Epperson hit a walk-off home run against UC Irvine and yesterday afternoon sophomore Cameron Newell squeezed in the winning run with a drag bunt to seal a 7-6 victory and establish UCSB as the comeback kids.</p>\n<p>“Coming back is the mark of a good team,” sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa said. “All the good teams I have ever been on have been like this where you just find ways to win. The great thing about this team is you never know who it’s going to be that’s going to step up.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara improves to 28-21 with the victory and remains at 12-9 in the Big West with the nonconference matchup. Washington State falls to 21-27 with the loss, its third in a row as the Cougars have now lost seven of their last eight.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos jumped out to an early lead as they often do at home, scoring a run in the bottom of the first inning. Epperson led off the Gauchos half of the inning with a single, and after he stole second, a two-out single by Kuresa would be all he needed to plate the first run.</p>\n<p>Freshman starting pitcher Domenic Mazza pitched well in his return to the mound after a lengthy absence due to back injuries. Mazza threw six innings and allowed just three runs over his final two innings of work.</p>\n<p>“I thought [Mazza] did really well there,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “He gave up the two at the end when he was a little gassed but he threw well. He did a great job through the first five. He threw a lot of strikes for us.”</p>\n<p>The Washington State bats came alive late as the Cougars were able to tack on six runs from the fifth inning on. Sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle came on in relief for Mazza and worked a scoreless seventh inning before getting touched up for two runs in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic led off the bottom of the eighth with a single and was lifted for a pinch runner. After a sacrifice bunt to move the runner to second, senior third baseman Marc Venning doubled home the tying run to even the score 5-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore shortstop Trace Tam Sing led off the eighth inning with a double and scored on a single by junior catcher Collin Slaybaugh to give WSU the lead.</p>\n<p>Down 6-5 in the bottom of the ninth, the Gauchos returned to the small-ball formula that worked in the eighth. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon got things started with a leadoff single. Another sacrifice bunt moved him into scoring position for Kuresa who drove home his third run of the game to tie it back to 6-6.</p>\n<p>Kuresa was lifted for a pinch runner who was moved to third on a Mahle groundout. With the winning run on third base, Newell laid down a bunt up the third base line to squeeze in the winning run.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, I got a good pitch to bunt and got it down the line,” Newell said. “It was a good team win today. Good job by Dom on the mound and our guys at the plate picking each other up offensively today.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its busy week with a trip to Loyola Marymount for a 3 p.m. game tomorrow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1321126390\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51372\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51375\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/gauchos-win-in-walk-off-fashion-again/markbrocher_baseball_4-19-2013_dsc_2748/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg?fit=4800%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4800,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366385730\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51375\" alt=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2748-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 14, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The project aims to make Isla Vista and its roads more pedestrian-friendly. <em>Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Representatives from Santa Barbara County announced Thursday that the county will be installing a continuous sidewalk through Sabado Tarde Road in the spring.</p>\n<p>According to Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, the county will add more sidewalks on the 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road. Curb ramps will be placed in several intersections along Sueno Road.</p>\n<p>Residents of these parts of Sabado Tarde Road will not have to wait long for the completion of this project. McGolpin projects it will be underway in the beginning of this spring, and he estimates construction will take approximately three months.</p>\n<p>This project, which bears a cost of $750,000, is being funded equally by the Santa Barbara County Community Development Block Grant Program and UC Santa Barbara. Each is allocating $2 million for this project and similar public works projects in the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>According to George Thurlow, UCSB special assistant for Isla Vista affairs, the project is part of the “joint county-university” safety improvements in Isla Vista. He said the University has pledged $2 million over the next 10 years to be matched by the county for sidewalks, streetlights and traffic improvements.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to have sidewalks on at least one side of all the streets in Isla Vista,” he said.</p>\n<p>The project is a continuation of an effort by the Santa Barbara Public Works Department to make Isla Vista more pedestrian-friendly. It was preceded by sidewalk installment projects on Del Playa Drive and Sueno Road throughout the last several years.</p>\n<p>“The community originally didn’t have sidewalks,” McGolpin said. “It takes time and money, and we’re slowly chipping away at it.”</p>\n<p>As of now, continuous sidewalks are sparse in Isla Vista. The county installed a long stretch of sidewalks along Del Playa Drive in 2002, and other streets have received segments of sidewalks over the following years. There are still many blocks in Isla Vista that do not have a consistent stretch of sidewalk.</p>\n<p>“Normally in California the way sidewalks get constructed is when you have an area that is going to be developed, you decide you want sidewalks and then you require developers to provide a sidewalk in front of their section of land,” said Jay Freeman, an 18-year Isla Vista resident and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the case during the development of Isla Vista. Although certain houses in the designated area of Sabado Tarde Road already have a sidewalk in front of them, they were installed during housing redevelopment.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the project seeks to change this so that every house on these blocks has a sidewalk without having to redevelop properties.</p>\n<p>Another motive for this sidewalk project is to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Since grabbing a win in the series finale at Fullerton, the Gauchos have gone 8-4, capturing three straight weekend series against conference opponents and now have had two straight Big West players of the week and three in the last four.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Joey Epperson takes the award from sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell this week as he was nearly unstoppable at the plate. Epperson went 8-14, extending his hitting streak to 12 games, with six runs scored, four RBI, a stolen base and a home run. The home run came in the bottom of the ninth with a runner on down by one in Sunday’s series finale with Irvine. Epperson took the first pitch deep against the Anteaters closer. On Friday’s game, Epperson had a four-hit day and was just a home run shy of the cycle.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense has really found its stride as of late. With the pitching staff struggling to stay healthy, the offense has been more than willing to put up as many runs as needed. Three Gauchos have had hitting streaks of nine or more games, with Epperson and Newell at 12 and 11 respectively. Sophomore shortstop Woody Woodward, who sits at nine games, could have been player of the week as he went 5-12 this weekend with five RBI.</p>\n<p>Northridge, however, is second in the league this year as a team in runs scored and RBI. Junior first baseman Josh Goossen-Brown leads the Big West conference with 43 RBI so far this year, as he has established himself as a major threat in the heart of the Matador order.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Miles Williams is also a player to keep an eye on. UCSB will look to keep runners off the bases while he is at the plate, as he has hit seven home runs this year in just 86 at bats.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Matadors set to show down at 3 p.m. on Friday at Matador field. Games two and three will both be at 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1287815177\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51272\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/baseball_magaligauthier-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=3456%2C5184&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3456,5184\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1361900171\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"240\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51273\" alt=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 9, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/","id":4456,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4455,4454,4453],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Fourth Consecutive Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team continued its streak of winning weekend series as it went 2-1 this weekend against Cal State Northridge for the team’s fourth consecutive weekend series win.

Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone followed up his season-worst performance of last week with a nine inning gem on Friday.</p>\n<p>“Austin was special [Friday]; he had a good live fastball and commanded the outside half of the plate,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Pettibone pitched a complete game, allowing just one run. Pettibone walked just one and struck out five on the way to his seventh victory of the season.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ sophomore starting pitcher Jerry Keel pitched equally well, throwing eight innings of shutout ball. He, however, was relieved in the ninth inning and the Gauchos put up six runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>The huge inning began with a quick out, but back to back singles began the outburst. Senior third baseman Marc Venning, making his return to the lineup after missing well over a month, was promptly hit by a pitch to load the bases.</p>\n<p>A bases-loaded walk brought home the first run of the game before junior catcher Jackson Morrow plated two runs on a base hit to left field. Another hit batter loaded the bases for junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon, who singled up the middle for two more runs.</p>\n<p>The relief pitching of the Matadors continued to crumble as sophomore Woody Woodward was the third hit batter of the inning. Woodward and Trinkwon then advanced to second and third, respectively, on a passed ball and Trinkwon scored on a wild pitch to complete the six-run inning and seal the 6-1 victory.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB again scored six runs en route to a 6-2 victory. Morrow got aboard with a single in the third and back to back Matador errors led to Morrow scoring the games first run.</p>\n<p>In the top of the fifth inning, junior leftfielder Joey Epperson, who had his 12-game hitting streak snapped in game one, led off the inning with a solo home run. Trinkwon then worked a walk and would come around to score on a single followed by another Matador error.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic doubled home two runs.
