UCSB’s outside hitters were outstanding, with redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins contributing seven kills, freshman Megan Rice adding six and junior Chanel Hoffman rounding out the unit with five more.</p>\n<p>Freshman Charlie Robinson and senior Phoebe Grunt were also tremendous for the Gauchos at middle blocker; Robinson had six kills on 11 attempts, good for a team-best .545 kill percentage, and Grunt’s 10.5 points were good for second highest for the match.</p>\n<p>UCSB hit a much higher percentage than Brown throughout the match, staying over .300 for all three games, and topping .400 in the first frame. Though the Bears hit .368 to open the match, the team followed with a dismal second set including 10 errors on the way to a -.143 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Brown’s junior libero and defensive specialist Melissa Cairo impressed on defense, securing more digs (10) than any other player in the match, and sophomore hitter Sabrina Stillwell still managed to come away with seven kills.</p>\n<p>The second match was UCSB’s closest of the day, as an undefeated St. John’s team came out fast with a 25-16 win in the opening set.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hit a poor .088 compared to the Red Storm’s .360 and committed nine errors to St. John’s one, leading to a mess of a first game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>They would come back to win the next three sets 25-22, 25-22 and 25-23 on the back of a match-high 20 kills from Lindsey Ruddins, who continues to rack up points for the Gaucho offense. Her dominant performance was paired with sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi’s, who carried the UCSB defense with 16 digs, also tops for the contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to best St. John’s in hitting percentage for the remainder of the match, accumulating 16 and 15 kills in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Each of the games were close with both teams trading impressive runs throughout the entire match, easily UCSB’s most difficult in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>St. John’s was led by strong efforts from their outside hitters, sophomore Margherita Bianchin and freshman Gaia Traballi, who amassed 14 and 12 kills respectively. Junior middle blocker Julia Cast and senior outside hitter Mona Karkkainen, both of whom also spend time at opposite hitter, turned in important performances as they were the third and fourth players on St. Johns to have double digit points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished Saturday’s double header strong, beating the host USF in straight sets 26-24, 25-12 and 25-15.</p>\n<p>Starting quickly was again an issue for the Gauchos, as a back and forth game appeared almost out of reach after falling behind 24-21. UCSB would fight back several set points, however, as a calm approach allowed them to maintain their focus and stave off their second lost game of the day.</p>\n<p>UCSB still held a strong advantage over the Dons in kill percentage in the first set, suggesting the gap between the two teams may have been wider than the score suggested. Such a hypothesis was strongly supported throughout the final two frames, with the Gauchos dominating the second set on the back of a game-winning 12-5 run and a staggering .688 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>The final set started with a 6-1 Gaucho run, and another six-point burst would all but seal the game and end the match.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Chanel Hoffman were again offensive centerpieces for UCSB, each totaling double-digit points, while Emilia Petrachi turned in another day’s work with 15 digs.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley and sophomore defensive specialist Lexi Rottman added 8 and 7 digs respectively, completing a great defensive effort from the Gauchos which saw the Dons finish with hitting percentages of -.043 and .057 in the final games.</p>\n<p>USF’s outside hitters played a solid game, with freshman Tyna Adamcikova providing 13 points and senior Emily Reed adding nine of her own.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was named the tournament’s most outstanding player with 38 kills and was joined on the all-tournament team by teammate Phoebe Grunt.</p>\n<p>This was Ruddins’s third time in as many opportunities this season making the all-tournament team, as well as her third time being awarded the Big West Freshman of the Week. Ruddins was nominated for the Player of the Week as well, and with her dominant play it would not be a surprise to see her take home that acknowledgment sooner than later.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos sit atop the Big West at 8-2 and will travel next to San Diego where they will participate in the California Mixer with San Diego State, San Jose State and USD on September 16 and 17.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72430\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72430\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-14/gauchos-sweep-through-usf-tournament/","id":5018,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5017,5016,5015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Back-to-Back Scoreless Fourth Quarters Doom Gauchos to Open MPSF Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MWpolo-vs-Alumni-10-3-15-5-JoseOchoa-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MWpolo-vs-Alumni-10-3-15-5-JoseOchoa-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Opening up MPSF play against a pair of formidable opponents, the UCSB men's water polo team fell just short with a pair of losses.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65011\" style=\"width: 777px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MWpolo-vs-Alumni-10-3-15-5-JoseOchoa-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1567188573\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65021\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65011\" data-attachment-id=\"65011\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/back-to-back-scoreless-fourth-quarters-doom-gauchos-to-open-mpsf-play/mwpolo-vs-alumni-10-3-15-5-joseochoa-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MWpolo-vs-Alumni-10-3-15-5-JoseOchoa-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Jose Ochoa\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS REBEL T3i&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;A UCSB Alumni player hammers home a shot far too quickly for the Gauchos' goalie, Kyle Garwick, to react.

His 700th save came on a power play opportunity that Cal failed to capitalize on.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool obviously and an honor,” Whitelegge said. “But it’s still team goals over individual goals for me.”</p>\n<p>Following that, the Gauchos found themselves up 5-2 in the second thanks to a penalty goal by Hauschild. However, momentum shifted quickly once Cal junior defender Farrel South converted on a penalty, reducing the Gauchos’ lead to 5-3.</p>\n<p>The Golden Bear defender sparked his team’s takeover of UCSB’s lead, scoring Cal’s next four goals to hand his team a 7-5 lead in the third period. Still, the Gauchos clawed their way back and managed to tie it 8-8 by the end of the third period.</p>\n<p>Despite a tied score heading into the match’s final period, UCSB’s performance fell victim to a sudden meltdown in the fourth. California scored the final four goals of the game, two by freshman attacker Johnny Hooper, who scored the opening goal of the fourth and the final goal.</p>\n<p>“Maybe I could have subbed more,” Wigo said. “We just weren’t that same team that we were in the first three periods and I thought it was fatigue. We dominated the first part of the game but then allowed easy goals, let them get back in and they just played a lot better in the second half.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos underwhelming fourth period proved to be the reason they lost against a great opponent. The same demise would haunt the Gauchos again in their next MPSF conference game against another formidable foe, the No. 5 Pacific Tigers.</p>\n<p>Unlike Saturday’s game, UCSB did not come out attacking aggressively to its capabilities. The Gauchos only mustered one goal in the first period and quickly found themselves down 2-1. UCSB seemed to be in a funk as it kept passing around the perimeter and forcing distant shots.</p>\n<p>Hauschild tried to break Santa Barbara out of its slump with an amazing deep goal as the shot clock expired. However, Pacific was just too dominant in the first half and ended the second period with a 3-0 run and a 5-2 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s confidence entering the third period looked a lot like the team that was dominating California the game before. Led by Hauschild, Santa Barbara outscored Pacific 4-1 in the third period and tied the score, 6-6. The sophomore attacker scored an impressive two goals and assisted on one with a beautiful pass to junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, who put through the equalizer with just seconds left in the third.</p>\n<p>“We came out a little slow,” Hauschild said. “Pacific plays a full zone; they let us shoot. We were just too timid in the first half. I wanted to prove that we could shoot and shoot out of that zone.”</p>\n<p>However, another scoreless fourth period by UCSB helped Pacific coast to its 9-6 victory. The Tigers scored on their first possession thanks to a beautiful deep goal by sophomore attacker Devon Thumwood and never looked back. Sophomore attacker Blake Hokkanen sealed the victory with a goal late in the game’s ending, just as the shot clock expired.</p>\n<p>The loss was another disappointing outcome for UCSB as fatigue seemed to be the repeat culprit in the team’s downfall. The same team that played well in that third frame completely disappeared in crunch time.</p>\n<p>“We struggled on offense but played well on defense,” Wigo said. “We have to finish out fourth quarters. After one game you never know but after two back-to-back games, we have to take a better look at that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will head out on the road to Malibu, California for the MPSF Southern California tournament. The tournament is to be held on Saturday, Oct. 10  and Sunday, Oct. 11. Times have yet to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The senior Attacker from Hungary will give the Gauchos’ defense fits if they are not able to stop him from creating opportunities for himself and his teammates.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first match begins Saturday at 12:00 p.m. at the UCSB Campus Pool against Cal.

Senior attacker Derek Shoemaker added a goal to make the score 7-4 with just over four minutes left.</p>\n<p>Although the game seemed like it was going to be easily won by UCSB, the 49ers did not go away easily, adding two goals to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 7-6 with just over one minute left. In its final possession, LBSU missed the shot and the clock ran out giving the Gauchos the victory and the seventh-place finish.</p>\n<p>Before ending on a high note, Santa Barbara lost to a team ranked lower than itself for the first time this season after a poor performance against UCI. It had beaten the Anteaters earlier in the season thanks to a game-winning shot. However, UCI was able to avoid the intense ending in Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ star senior driver Lovre Milos started the scoring by making a goal three seconds into the start of the match. UCSB responded by scoring two goals courtesy of Shoemaker but gave up two scores to the Anteaters as they took the 3-2 lead after the first.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker and Hamilton added two goals for UCSB in the second quarter to give it a 4-3 halftime lead. However, in the second half the team fell apart, surrendering five-straight goals.</p>\n<p>Within a span of thirty seconds into the third quarter, the Anteaters scored three goals to go up 6-4. They would add one more in the fourth to win the game 7-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ four goals tied a season-low. It would be in back-to-back matches they tied their season-low, having happened first in their quarterfinal matchup against Cal.</p>\n<p>The Bears scored two goals in the first quarter to take an early lead. UCSB’s lone goal in the first half came late in the second period thanks to Shoemaker. After his score, the Gauchos surrendered three-straight goals, going down 6-1 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Cal added two more goals to start the third and took a commanding 8-1 lead. With the quarter nearing the end, Shoemaker added one more goal to make the score 8-2 after three quarters.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker completed a hat trick in the fourth period, scoring his third score of the game. Hauschild also added a goal but the outcome was inevitable. The Gauchos lost 11-4, diminishing their hopes of winning their first MPSF championship in school history.</p>\n<p>Still, the two seniors that led Santa Barbara throughout the season put on good performances to end their careers as Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge tallied 40 saves on the weekend, ending his career with 895 saves, the second most in MPSF history. Shoemaker had six goals in the three games and finished the season as the Gauchos leading scorer with 48.</p>\n<p>Although the final weekend did not go the way UCSB intended it to go, it still had a solid season overall. The 16-11 finish was an improvement from the year before and overall, the team looked competitive in almost every match.</p>\n<p>The losses of the four seniors will have an impact, but the Gauchos still have plenty of young talent such as Hauschild, Jovanovic and Hamilton returning. The exposure that these young players gained from playing this season along with the growth of the rest of the team makes UCSB a considerable contender to emerge for a top finish in next year’s MPSF standings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
