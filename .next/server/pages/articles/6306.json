In recent years, porn sites have increasingly featured clips of young, natural-looking women in unassuming bedrooms who look like they could easily be the hot girl you pass in the street on the way to work or sit next to in your next class. In our digital age, agents, production companies and networking are no longer necessary for an aspiring porn star to make it big. In order to star in your own erotic film, the process is now as simple as film, edit and upload. This emerging category of low-budget, low-production films starring inexperienced actresses is known to audiences as “amateur porn.” Its natural and spontaneous feel holds an alluring appeal to viewers, making them feel as if they are watching real people having real sex rather than a scripted, airbrushed encounter.</p>\n<p>I’m going to come right out and say that I used to be one of these people with whom amateur porn struck a particularly appealing chord. As a curious girl searching for material that would actually satisfy my needs, the exaggerated screams and forced expressions of delight in professional porn videos just did not pique my interest to the level I desired. With every loud, dramatic scene I saw, I was left feeling even more disappointed. I was simply unable to suspend my disbelief enough to feel immersed in these scenes and actually enjoy myself rather than giggling at how ridiculous it all was.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73298\" style=\"width: 627px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73298\" data-attachment-id=\"73298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-19/the-disturbing-reality-behind-the-scenes-of-amateur-porn/amateurporn-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amateurporn-art-.jpg?fit=617%2C881&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"617,881\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"amateurporn-art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amateurporn-art-.jpg?fit=175%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amateurporn-art-.jpg?fit=617%2C881&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73298\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amateurporn-art-.jpg?resize=617%2C881\" alt=\"Art by Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus \" width=\"617\" height=\"881\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amateurporn-art-.jpg?w=617&amp;ssl=1 617w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amateurporn-art-.jpg?resize=175%2C250&amp;ssl=1 175w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Ashlea Vedder / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>I was never able to find anything that clicked with me until I discovered the amateur section: pages and pages of videos featuring young actresses who looked and acted like they could actually exist outside the glossy pages of Playboy, situated in plain bedrooms and filmed with a handheld camera or fixed tripod setup. Compared to the perfectly sculpted moaning sex goddesses and spacious mansion sets I was used to, it felt authentic, candid and natural; it was just what I needed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, I’m not writing this article to inform you about the wonders of amateur porn or direct you to open up an incognito tab right now. I’m here to inform you about the dark side of this rapidly expanding trend and the reasons why I now refuse to watch amateur porn.</p>\n<p>After taking a close look at amateur porn and its creation process, the regrettable conclusion I have reached is this: unlike professional porn — a large industry network composed of producers, agents and performers who all must abide by certain regulations or risk a bad reputation within the industry or even losing their job — the low budget, minimally produced nature of amateur porn opens the door for the manipulation and abuse of female performers who are fully unprepared for what they’re getting into.</p>\n<p>So how exactly does this manipulation occur? One of the answers lies in the digital era we live in today. Ten or 20 years ago, most pornography was made by professional companies who produced the films and released them on DVD. Therefore, the only people who made them were employed in the industry and were incentivized to go about filming and producing in a way that was fair to the actors in order to maintain their status and reputation as professionals. These types of established companies still exist today, but they now share the stage with small independent producers who make amateur films at a low budget and release them straight to the internet.</p>\n<p>Now, one does not need to be a professional or work for any sort of company in order to produce and distribute porn; to start filming, the only steps necessary are recruiting some performers, setting up a camera and pressing “record.” This gives independent producers enormous discretion on how they wish to go about hiring and treating their performers.</p>\n<p>Large, established companies have a reputation to uphold and many employees working to make sure that reputation, and their own reputations, are pristine. However, independent producers with no institutional ties must only ensure the quality of their content, not the fairness of its production. The process of filming a video and publishing it straight to the internet removes the sense of accountability that would be present in a professional shoot.</p>\n<p>I also think it’s necessary to look at the girls who are performing in these videos. One of the most alluring aspects of amateur porn is that the performers starring in it are, well, amateurs: young, inexperienced girls just past the age of 18 who have little to no prior experience with the industry and are simply trying to earn some cash. They don’t have connections to people who have been in the industry and know how it works, nor do they have the financial or professional status to provide leverage for their own needs. This creates an alarming power dynamic between the performers and the producers hiring them; a young, naive girl starting out in amateur porn does not have the resources, knowledge or professional experience to know when she is being treated unfairly or what to do about it.</p>\n<p>If she is being flown out to a location to film the scene, she may not feel comfortable objecting to scenes she does not desire to perform for fear of upsetting the people who have so graciously paid for her flight and will ultimately be signing her paycheck at the end of the day. Unfortunately, this is a perfect opportunity for producers to take advantage of the way girls have been conditioned to behave in our society: be kind, be likeable, appear sexy and confident, but do what you’re told and don’t be a bitch or a diva by complaining when you feel a situation has crossed the line.</p>\n<blockquote><p>the decision [to get into porn] makes a whole lot of sense once you understand the limited options these young women face.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In porn, “crossing the line” can translate to a girl being forced to perform in scenes which include acts such as forced oral sex, verbal and/or physical aggression, or anal sex. Since these more intense scenes mean bigger paychecks for all involved, producers have a monetary incentive to push performers to their limits with little regard for their willingness to perform these acts. Though many people are habituated to seeing these kind of scenes in mainstream porn, an amateur actress may have never performed these acts on her own, let alone on camera, and may reasonably be afraid or uncomfortable to proceed but feel that she has no choice. Without a formal contract or her own agent to consult, the performer doesn’t know if she can object and may feel that her only option is to perform the scene and get it over with.</p>\n<p>For anyone who justifies unfair treatment of these girls on the basis that they willingly signed up to be in porn, consider the potential for coercion due to their socioeconomic status and lack of other options available. For example, a girl growing up in a poor Midwestern town faces the choice of remaining in her local vicinity and becoming a wife and mother, going off to college and then pursuing her own career or finding some other means of income if she wishes to become independent and leave her hometown.</p>\n<p>If she chooses to settle down, she will be financially controlled by a man and unable to break free should the relationship become abusive. If she chooses college, the question of how to pay looms over her head. Therefore, it makes sense that she would jump at the opportunity to earn a few thousand or maybe even a few hundred dollars despite the possibility of harm. A person who is financially well situated with attainable goals and a supportive network of family and friends may shake their head in perplexity at girls who throw themselves into porn in the hopes of making it big, but the decision makes a whole lot of sense once you understand the limited options these young women face.</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the lack of legal regulations placed on pornographic content. The few laws that do exist mostly consist of ineffective attempts to prevent the spread of STDs, and do not address consent or fair treatment of the performers at all. For example, a 2012 law called Measure B requires the use of condoms in all anal and vaginal porn scenes in California, but this requirement can be easily bypassed by filming the scenes in other states. Another regulation requires performers to be tested for STDs every 14 days and present documentation of their clean status, but many STDs have incubation periods of several months, allowing the possibility of an undetected infection to be passed from one performer to another despite clean test results. These shaky mandates are a few of the only laws in place regulating the process of making pornography, and they are grossly ineffective in practice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whether or not they choose to take advantage of it, independent producers of amateur porn have the ability to profit from the abuse and coercion of female performers with few ramifications.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The legal system for preventing STDs in porn may be flawed, but in terms of consent and abuse of power, there is essentially no system at all. It seems that the law only has STDs in mind as harms that could potentially occur on the set of a porn shoot. Suing in civil court for assault or rape could technically be an option for girls who feel they have been forced to perform a scene, but considering the condescending attitude our society has toward sex workers, I highly doubt that a judge or jury would have any sympathy for a young girl who elected to partake in porn. No matter how legitimate her claims may be, the stigma against girls who openly engage in sexual activity is just too deeply ingrained.</p>\n<p>If high school and college-aged girls are shamed and not taken seriously in the wake of an assault, imagine the fate of a porn star attempting to make these allegations. Without an effective legal system in place to report harmful incidents, amateur performers have no means of seeking justice or accountability.</p>\n<p>The combination of factors including the digital process of creating and distributing amateur porn, the imbalance of power between female performers and independent producers and the lax laws regulating pornography sets up many opportunities for producers to violate or abuse their performers in the process of creating pornographic scenes. Before you rush to call me extreme or radical for raising these issues, keep in mind that I am not claiming that the harms I have listed occur on every single amateur porn shoot or that producers are inherently unethical. I simply wish to draw attention to the monetary incentive for abusing performers and the ease with which producers can get away with this behavior.</p>\n<p>Whether or not they choose to take advantage of it, independent producers of amateur porn have the ability to profit from the abuse and coercion of female performers with few ramifications. Some of these instances have gone public (type “GirlsDoPorn controversy” into your search browser and you will find several allegations regarding the popular amateur porn network GirlsDoPorn.com and its abuse of female performers), but these incidents are certainly not the only ones that have occurred. It is simply too easy for producers to take advantage of the young girls who depend on them for a source of income.</p>\n<p>Many people watch these scenes every day, blissfully unaware as I once was of the abuse and unethical treatment that can occur behind the scenes. I’m not advocating for anyone to stop watching porn altogether — that would be an extreme and, let’s face it, entirely unrealistic proposition to an audience of sexually frustrated college students.</p>\n<p>All I’m asking is that the next time your mouse hovers over a promising thumbnail of a young, innocent looking girl posed demurely on a bed gazing seductively at the camera, consider the ordeal that this girl may have had to endure in order to create this scene for your viewing pleasure. Think about the potential abuse and coercion that you are implicitly endorsing when you press play. In this situation, awareness is key. If viewers start demanding fair treatment and accountability, then maybe one day amateur porn stars will truly be as authentically and naturally in their element as they appear to be today.</p>\n<p><em>Laurel Rinehart wants you to think about what might be happening in amateur porn that you don’t see on camera. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.

It all stemmed from the fact that I decided to drown my unwanted emotions in tequila. I know that drinking to cope with emotion is unhealthy, but I also know we all make mistakes. Well, unfortunately for me, the mistakes I made this weekend will probably haunt me for a while. Not just because of the humiliation that I feel, but also because of the disappointing things I learned about myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I’ve always thought of myself as being pretty well-rounded. Since I was about five years old, I can remember being told that I’m an old soul, that I’m incredibly mature and that I have a bright future ahead of me. I moved out of my dad’s house when I was 18, and then moved across the country when I was 20. I make good grades, I have an internship that I love and I’m surrounded by an amazing group of family and friends who support me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’ve never been hesitant to follow my dreams, and success has always seemed attainable to me. However, my biggest struggle that has plagued me since I turned 16 is my ability to maintain any sort of intimate relationship.

I was surrounded by romance and cuteness, listening to stories of first kisses and first times. I watched adorable “promposals” and saw countless candid photos of teens in love on my Instagram. At the time, I wasn’t really envious. I actually thought they were all idiots. Maybe my parents’ dysfunctional marriage made me bitter, or maybe I was repressing my jealousy at the lack of affection in my life. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of why, I didn’t feel like I was missing out on much. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the back of my mind, I knew these dramatic and naïve relationships wouldn’t last long after graduation. Then, right before the start of my senior year, I experienced my first real, intimate relationship. It was not cute, it was not romantic, and it was nothing like my friends’. It was damaging, abusive and emotionally traumatic. It was my first and only real encounter with any sort of romantic or sexual feeling. And, after it abruptly ended, it was the only thing I knew. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two years that followed this relationship were a complete and utter mess. With this newfound heartbreak and my parents’ ongoing divorce, I felt completely out of control. I turned to partying and casual sex, thinking it would make me look less pathetic or weak. If anything, it did the exact opposite. Every relationship that followed was a rollercoaster, going from being extremely great to utterly sorrowful and back around again. I don’t even think I liked the guys that I was spending my time with, but I needed to feel some sort of validation from them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after starting college, the relationships were all distorted and tumultuous. Eventually, being sad felt more comfortable than being happy. In my head, each guy was the same, and I knew that soon enough I would be screwed over and left to feel unworthy. I was dealing with conflicting emotions of frustration, shame and embarrassment. I couldn’t believe that I had let these guys affect me in such a negative way, even to the extent of doubting my own self-worth. Then I got my acceptance letter to UCSB, and I knew I would get a clean slate.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been about nine months since I transferred here. I love it even more than I ever thought I would. However, I naively and blindly assumed that moving far away from the people in my past would mean that the baggage I carry would stay behind as well. A few weeks ago, I met a guy that was unbelievably sweet and goofy. Not really the type of person you’d expect to meet at a frat party. At first, I thought he was totally safe and not someone I would really be that interested in. Then, after getting to know him better, the unsettling realization that I might actually like him set in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Treat every new person in your life with a clean slate, regardless of who hurt you in the past, try not to let your reaction be an overreaction and stay the hell away from Jose Cuervo.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Long story short, I panicked. I was already so on edge about my own feelings that I sabotaged the entire thing over a minuscule action. I got drunk, made a complete ass of myself, and the only person I can blame is me. I was completely disrespectful and crazy to someone who had given me no reason to act in such a way. Someone who had been nothing but sweet to me. Someone whose company I was really beginning to enjoy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here I am again, feeling sorry for myself. Only this time, it’s way worse. Because this time, I have to face the fact that I screwed myself. I screwed myself out of something that had potential to actually be good. I screwed myself out of making a real connection with someone. I screwed myself before even giving him the chance to screw up. If anything good is going to come out of this humiliation and regret, then I guess it’s the fact that I’ll never turn to alcohol for advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll never project old relationships onto new ones. I’ll never blame someone for my unhappiness before look at my own actions. And I’ll never again let insecurities from my past drive the decisions that I make in the present. Learning things the hard way is … well … hard. There’s nothing fun about it. But, if this is what I needed in order to grow up, accept responsibility and move forward, then so be it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you don’t want to end up like me, listening to Mumford and Sons’ “Little Lion Man” on repeat and feeling like a total idiot, then take my advice. Treat every new person in your life with a clean slate, regardless of who hurt you in the past, try not to let your reaction be an overreaction and stay the hell away from Jose Cuervo.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos your rough past won’t keep you from a bright future. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-01/drunken-emotions-a-sobering-reality-and-getting-screwed/","id":6303,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6302,6301,6300],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How Girls Can Ease Their Morning After","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos shares some tips on how to make a potentially awkward morning a little more comfortable.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As a woman, waking up the “morning after” can sometimes be a lot more stressful than romantic. Unless you’re in a serious or long-term relationship, you most likely haven’t reached that level of comfortability where waking up with makeup smeared and teeth unbrushed are normal and pleasant. Those awkward moments experienced during the morning after, where you can feel insecure, unprepared and just downright annoyed, can all be diminished by carrying these four small items in your purse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Condom(s):</em> This is probably the most important item to have in your bag if you think that you might be going home with someone. Common misconception and stereotype says that the guy should always have the condom. This ideology is unbelievably outdated and can have dangerous consequences. Once you’ve started hooking up and reach a certain point, it becomes pretty hard to stop. Therefore, if you’re making out with someone and you’ve both decided that you want to have sex, yet neither of you have a condom, you might make the impulsive decision to have intercourse without protection.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Common misconception and stereotype says that the guy should always have the condom. This ideology is unbelievably outdated and can have dangerous consequences.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">While it may seem like a fine idea at time, once the arousal and adrenaline has worn off, you’re going to be filled with grief and stress over the idea of possibly contracting an STI or having an unwanted pregnancy due to a stupid decision made the night before. To ensure that you take all steps necessary to prevent that uncomfortable dissonance experienced in the morning, it’s best to just always buy and carry your own condoms.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Mints:</em> One of my least favorite things about waking up next to someone in the morning is the fact that I have to be near someone before I’ve had the chance to brush my teeth. If you wake up in a new partner’s home, it can be super annoying to have to quietly get up, find the bathroom and locate their toothpaste, only to have to use your finger to brush your teeth (because carrying a toothbrush would be somewhat excessive). If you’re lucky, they might be a mouthwash kind of person, and you can just steal a swig of Listerine.</p>\n<p>However, just to be safe, I find it easiest to always carry either gum or mints. Anything really will do, whether it’s Altoids or Extra, just make sure you have something. You can quietly reach into your purse, pop one in and relinquish the taste of morning. Word of caution: sometimes mints are a better choice over gum, simply because mints dissolve while gum doesn’t. Therefore, if your partner wakes up and tries to spontaneously kiss you, it can be slightly awkward if you’re chomping on some Orbit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70645\" style=\"width: 467px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70645\" data-attachment-id=\"70645\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/morning-after-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=1360%2C1927&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1360,1927\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"morning after art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70645 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=457%2C647\" alt=\"Art by Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus \" width=\"457\" height=\"647\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1 176w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=768%2C1088&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70645\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Art by Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>A comb:</em> If you have long, thick hair like me, you know that more often than not, it is possible to wake up with a rat’s nest on top of your head. Sex definitely doesn’t help. After a night of … fornication, a girl’s hair is not bound to look the same as it did the night before. The curls have unraveled and the hairspray has gone awry. It can get tangled, knotted and just be downright frustrating to deal with in the morning, especially when you’re not in your own home with your own things.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">After a night of … fornication, a girl’s hair is not bound to look the same as it did the night before.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">OK, I know a comb is not nearly as effective as a brush; however, carrying an actual brush around in a small bag is neither always ideal nor possible. If you don’t own a comb, go get one. They are tiny, effective and easy to whip out when necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Foundation:</em> the only makeup item that you really need to carry incase you decide to have an unexpected slumber party. Mascara, eyeliner, blush, etc., are all great but way too excessive and annoying to carry around. The truth is, very few people look picture perfect in the mornings. Yet, simply having some cover-up or foundation to put under your eyes, or cover last night’s smeared makeup, can take away some of those insecurities you might experience when seeing a new partner not-so-fresh faced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is, all of the above listed items, besides a condom (ALWAYS CARRY ONE), are superficial amenities that aren’t by any means necessary, but can alleviate some of the uncomfortable annoyances that come with spending the night out. While the person you wake up to should never expect you to look like Sleeping Beauty awaking from her slumber, these easy tips can make your morning after experience much more enjoyable and relaxed.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos hopes these tips make it so you never have to stress the next morning again.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/","id":6304,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6303,6302,6301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Having ‘Condom’ Sense","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4-condom270112-de.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4-condom270112-de.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos brings attention to the decision of whether or not to use a condom during sex.

As a freshman in high school, I was just being introduced to the actualities of “womanhood” and sex. Being that I was essentially clueless as to what sex actually entailed, I was extremely curious about it. I mean, who isn’t slightly disturbed yet intrigued after first hearing about “the birds and the bees?”</p>\n<p>As I flipped through the beauty ads and fashion tips, I came across a section titled, “5 Lies He’ll Say To Get in Your Pants.” At the time this seemed like immensely valuable information, so I decided to read it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first “lie” was extremely obvious; giving the old “he’ll only say I love you to sleep with you!” rant. I had heard that one from my grandmother since I was about five, so I felt pretty equipped to handle that. However, the second one caught me by major surprise. It talked about how a guy might tell me, “I don’t want to use a condom because then I can’t feel anything.” Being that the majority of my sexual knowledge came from sex-ed, I was totally shell-shocked.</p>\n<p>I mean, after learning of all of the horrors that can come with an unwanted pregnancy or STD, what kind of idiot would say they don’t want to use a condom just because it doesn’t feel as good? Isn’t that why Trojan makes “Ultra Thin?” In my baffled state I reasoned that I would never be interested in a guy that would be that selfish or idiotic. About three years later, when I became sexually active, I was forced to face the hard truth about boys and condoms.</p>\n<p>Nearly every guy that I’ve encountered in the bedroom has attempted to sleep with me without using a condom. Some of them were long-term relationships, others … not so much. My first experience was obviously blinding and scary like it is for most young men and women. The guy was a little older than me, and much more experienced. Therefore, I put all of my trust into him, thinking he knew what was best.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nearly every guy that I’ve encountered in the bedroom has attempted to sleep with me without using a condom.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was never one of those girls that thought that I would want to wait until marriage for sex; I’ve always been somewhat of a realist. But I definitely thought I would always be extremely responsible and NEVER risk getting an STD or pregnant.</p>\n<p>Then, the first time I had sex, I allowed the guy to convince me that a condom wasn’t necessary. He told me, “You can’t get pregnant the first time you have sex,” a lie I stupidly believed. Luckily, I didn’t get pregnant and I didn’t catch an STD. However, I did lose a sense of confidence and independence that was very important when making any big decisions. The fact that I had given in so easily, without really thinking twice, made me question how secure I was in myself. They say that before you can truly care about anyone else, you have to be able to care for you. If I had truly been secure in myself, I would have stuck to my standards and made him wear a condom, regardless of his excuses.</p>\n<p>Since then I have gained enough experience to come to the realization that many guys will try to get by without using condoms. At first, I thought that my taste in men had just taken a completely wrong turn; but after talking to a handful of girlfriends, I realized that it’s much more common than not. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the guy who tries to sleep with you minus a condom is a disgusting, selfish asshole; it just means that he might not think he has as much to lose.</p>\n<p>When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the woman is the one who truly faces the most adversaries. Her body is the one being forced to undergo some sort of drastic measure, whether it is to have an abortion or carry a baby to term. She is the one who has to make the difficult and life-altering decision.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the woman is the one who truly faces the most adversaries.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While a man endures various struggles that may come with getting a girl pregnant, they’re not nearly as severe. In regards to STDs, it still surprises me that guys often seem to feel invincible to them. I mean HIV, herpes and chlamydia don’t discriminate based on gender. However, women do actually have a few more things to worry about when it comes to STDs. HPV (human papillomavirus) has several strains that can cause cervical cancer in women. The results can be deadly, especially since symptoms rarely show.</p>\n<p>The terrifying part is that the majority of sexually active men carry HPV, yet don’t realize it considering it doesn’t affect them. If a carrier of HPV has unprotected sex with someone, the consequences can be severe. In addition, curable STDs such as chlamydia can cause infertility in women when left untreated. These are a couple of reasons why men may be more relaxed when it comes to the necessity of a condom</p>\n<p>While they can sometimes be inconvenient, annoying and tedious, there really is no good enough reason for a man to state that he doesn’t want to use a condom. Unless both you and your partner have been tested and have access to other forms of birth control, no one has any business claiming that a condom is not necessary. If you’re a woman who is not comfortable having sex without a condom, stick to your standards and do not budge. It’s you’re body, and you’re the one who may have the most to lose. While guys may think it’s just not that big of deal in the moment, it definitely will be in the long run.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos asks you to condone the condom.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/","id":6305,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6304,6303,6302],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
