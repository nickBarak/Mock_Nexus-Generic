\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on the island of Bali, Indonesia, Alexander first encountered a keyboard at age six and immediately knew piano was his calling, jazz piano in particular. Not only could he pick up virtually any blues composition by ear, but he could also improvise with a level of experience far beyond his years. In 2014 at the young age of 11, the musical genius was discovered by jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and flown out to New York for Marsalis’s all-star jazz concert at Lincoln Center. From there, his career took off. He’s released two solo albums and been nominated for two Grammys in just the past two years.</p>\n<p>This is Alexander’s first time on the road. He was accompanied by Juilliard graduate and two-time Grammy winner Ulysses Owen, Jr. on the drums and Berklee College of Music alum Reuben Rogers on upright bass. Celesta M. Billeci, executive director of the Arts &amp; Lectures program, introduced the band by simply stating, “I don’t even know how to describe what you’re about to see tonight except: Wow.”</p>\n<p>Greeted with tremendous applause, Alexander opened the show with a classic by John Coltrane called “Calm Down” followed by several original compositions. He received continuous encouragement from bass player Rogers, who periodically yelled out a supportive “yeah!” The trio as a whole was tremendously in sync; Alexander thrives in the syncopated rhythms of jazz. He studied classical music as a child, like the works of Mozart and Tchaikovsky, but always wanted to elaborate on it. Classical music is supposed to be played as written, though; you’re not supposed to embellish. Jazz, however, allows the freedom to express yourself, unlike classical composition, and you can tell it’s what the young virtuoso is meant to be playing.</p>\n<p>His bandmates perfectly complemented him with many impressive solos displaying their remarkable skills on their respective instruments. If you think Miles Teller was good in “Whiplash,” you obviously haven’t seen Owen, Jr. play yet. His hands moved so quickly they completely blurred. Rogers, the “jokester” of the gang according to Alexander, was having the time of his life on stage, yelling out and swaying with the music.</p>\n<p>Now, if you like music — which I assume you do if you’re reading this article — you’ll like Alexander’s original compositions. They’re simply inspirational. It’s more than just genius in its arrangement, it’s the notion of a 13-year-old following his dream and truly succeeding. Every silence and pause was precise and intentional. It’s the kind of music that makes you feel deep down in your core. It makes you want to get out of your seat and cheer, cry and grin. Many audience members shook their heads in disbelief. After the first piece, the woman to my left let out a quiet “Wow,” one you could only hear if you were sitting directly next to her. Everyone was thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>After the show, Eleanor York was more than excited to share her thoughts about Alexander’s performance. “It was phenomenal. The way everyone played off of each other and with each other; it’s amazing for anyone, let alone a thirteen 13-year-old,” said York, who has followed Wynton Marsalis as a frequent patron of the Arts &amp; Lectures events for years and knew when Joey got his endorsement he was someone to look out for. “It was just delicious.”</p>\n<p>It’s hard to think of a word other than “adorable” to describe the pianist, but gifted will undoubtedly suffice. When he speaks, though he is not completely fluent in English, he is humble and compassionate. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Hans Christian Andersen: “Where words fail, music speaks.” While Joey’s English may not be the best, he certainly makes up for it with his music. His sound and soul are much older than 13 years, and when he plays you forget about his age. This was evident in the <em>two</em> standing ovations he received.</p>\n<p>I was left with only one question at the end of the night: is Joey good for a 13-year-old, or is he just good? I think it’s safe to say he’s just good.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/","id":6732,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[6731,6730,6729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield","biography":"Not available","articles":[2384,2413,2447,2457,2712,3913,4418,5825,6732],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Laura Marling is a Darling","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14068238_10153949798312972_5351778634474286955_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14068238_10153949798312972_5351778634474286955_n.jpg?resize=783%2C519&ssl=1","description":"It’s rare for one denuded voice and an old, acoustic guitar to transfix an audience so completely as Laura Marling did this past Friday night.

At the SOhO venue candlelit tables are were sprinkled around the room like confetti, the bar buzzed with the low thrum of conversation and black and white photographs paying homage to the likes of Van Morrison, Blondie and Keith Richards graced the red brick walls. Beneath them, sofas tempted attendees into their cushions in repose before the show. This venue recalls something of a New York loft or sophisticated London pub, making Marling’s choice to play the last night of her West Coast tour here especially important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The elfin artist emerged donning a pair of vintage Levi jeans and a flowing white blouse, an old soul-come-avant-garde ingénue. Hazy blue light flooded the expectant stage. Marling began her set with “Take the Night Off,”  the opening track to her fourth album</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Once I Was An Eagle</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Albeit 30 minutes late, the whole room took in the sound of her haunting vibrato at once. Her voice and guitar instantly took command of the intimate space. The small stage of a quiet, California venue is where Marling feels most at home, unfettered from her mythological status in England. Marling unfurled the rest of her 60-minute set in a kaleidoscopic series of glissando rises and falls, her songs an amalgam of jovial conversation and piercing insights into the nature of love, life and loss. Marling’s nu-folk style lends itself to live performance. Her songs float into the silent crowd and settle in the minds and hearts, resonating with authenticity that is foreign to the studio album. Alternating between her own songs and covers of the iconic Bob Dylan’s “Up To Me” and Dolly Parton’s “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind,” Marling gave a nod to her artistic lineage and returned to her own footing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her first song was met with enthusiastic applause.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I saw an otter yesterday,” Marling confided in the audience, “and I had a small malfunction of excitement. 10 years ago the British otter population was nearly extinct and now they’re thriving. So next time someone says something bad you can tell them the otters are thriving at least.” She followed this cheerful observation with the building beat of the jaunty “Short Movie,” the titular track of her most recent album. Disappointingly, after only a couple of minutes she stumbled and had to abandon the song, admitting, “I can’t remember how to play it, I’m so sorry!” Nevertheless, having made an immediate friend in the night’s audience, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her blunder was forgiven by the sound of emboldening cheers, and she ensued with a unique cover of famed country singer Dolly Parton.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short Movie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> signposted a new direction in Marling’s musical career. It stepped away from her lyrically dominant acoustic folk and moved toward a more reverberating, electronic sound, inspired by the loneliness she felt during her revelatory years in Los Angeles. Yet, within the dimly lit, intimate walls of SOhO, both new and old songs were stripped bare and reimagined by a more mature, worldly Marling, a far cry from the diffident young woman of her past. Her acrobatic vocals jumped, twirled, twisted and landed flawlessly throughout “Wildfire,” her pensive tone and elastic range imbuing each lyric with a vulnerability that made them accessible. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">piercing high notes of “I Feel Your Love” sailed over the sound of her guitar as she leaned into her soprano with new weight, while the jubilant thrum of a colloquial “Rambling Man” got everybody’s feet tapping.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marling’s dusty vocals have matured as age and experience have facilitated growth into an evermore textured sound. Jack Wallace, a third-year English major, described Marling as “a total delight onstage. You could tell how in love with her instrument she was.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marling’s affinity with her instrument is perhaps what distinguishes her authenticity as an artist. Her lyrics, meanwhile, conjure a web of images that suddenly resolve into relatable sentiments that touch each member of the audience individually. Marling has described her lyrics as “personal, but not confessional.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> By valuing sentiment over specificity, Marling bestows her listeners with the power to find their own meaning in them. It is this quality that ensures </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her feelings are translatable. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanda Curtis, a graduate student at UCSB, admitted, “They’re incredibly subtle, her lyrics. But they’re extremely perceptive. I teared up twice. I love that a woman can be so honest, and emotional, and raw and also powerful.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marling closed her short but sweet set </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with a bluesy rendition of “Once.” On this melancholy note, and with a shy goodbye, she left the stage. Her songs bear witness to her personal metamorphosis as well as communicate a universal sense of meaning and the internal conflict that defines what it is to be human. </span></p>\n<div

Barbara. Wild Nothing is a critically acclaimed indie-pop band solely created by Jack Tatum in 2009. At the time, Tatum was finishing his senior year of college, but that didn’t stop him from releasing Wild Nothing’s debut album <i>Gemini,</i> which brought an immense amount of attention to Tatum’s dreamlike and nostalgic style.</p>\n<p><i>Gemini </i>features a variety of songs that showcase Tatum’s unique approach to creating music. The songs feature beautiful and whimsical keyboard sounds as well as simple but sweet additions from the guitar. <i>Gemini </i>ultimately evokes a sense of longing through Tatum’s dim lyrics, but still presents hints of light by pairing soft pop beats with peaceful rhythms. The initial song on this album, “Live in Dreams,” immediately represents the more somber approach Tatum takes when writing lyrics and creating sounds. Other songs on this album such as “Bored Games” and “Summer Holiday” are calm, beautiful tracks that force you to feel nostalgic for anything, whether it’s childhood, old love or a past memory. Wild Nothing knows how to be an innovative force in the current indie music scene.  Tatum effortlessly makes you grasp the sentiment and longing you’ve pushed back and tried to rid yourself of. The talented indie artist cultivates within listeners that it is okay to be feel nostalgia and to reflect on the beauty of the past. This is ultimately what Wild Nothing does to us with <i>Gemini </i>and this is without a doubt what to expect if you catch them in concert at the SOhO Restaurant and Music Club on Tuesday, Oct. 18.</p>\n<p>Tatum continued to develop his synth-heavy brand of music with the release of perhaps Wild Nothing’s most acclaimed album, <i>Nocturne.</i> This album shares similar stylistic traits as <i>Gemini,</i> but Tatum dives deeper in providing a more soothing and holistic sound for listeners. The leading tracks on<i> Nocturne</i>, “Paradise” and “Shadow,” are undeniably luscious, gentle and blissful songs. This album and Wild Nothing collectively are the epitome of ‘80s dream-pop, a unique quality that Wild Nothing brings to the current indie scene. Each song on <i>Nocturne </i>possesses delicate rhythms and soft, alluring sounds that paint light-colored images. “Through the Grass” and “Nocturne” are just two of the many songs on this album that give listeners a truly introspective experience, and this is what makes Wild Nothing such an avant-garde project in the indie music realm. Overall, Tatum does an exceedingly well job of crafting glimmering and echoing sounds with <i>Nocturne</i>, and provides listeners a simply beautiful, elegant and delicate album to indulge in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wild Nothing is definitely worth seeing live.

After the lull of summer, I.V. is again filled with students enjoying their community and ready to see some fun-filled live shows. With so many new and returning Isla Vista residents, the UCSB Community Housing Office, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District welcomed everyone with the Kick-Off Community Concert. The event served as a housing fair, educational center and venue for Isla Vista talent.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’oyo’ Park was set up as a maze of tables for the event. Representatives from many I.V. property providers were there offering cookies, lemonade and information about their properties. The Isla Vista Tenants Union sparked interest in passersby with games and prizes such as succulents and various home goods. A photo booth was nestled in the back of the park with fun hats and accessories. The atmosphere was festive and welcoming as people talked, ate and lounged on the grassy hill of the park’s amphitheater. What really drew the crowds, however, was the upbeat music permeating I.V.’s usual cacophony of sounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Real Savage Henry was first to perform, reinstating their presence as a staple of the Isla Vista music scene. They brought their usual persona of fun and humor to the stage, wearing novelty accessories like a captain’s cap and a sailor hat. Wilder Kehke danced barefoot across the stage with his guitar and a carefree air of enjoyment. Even when many people were still roaming through the tables instead of sitting down to watch, the band remained lively and interactive with their initially small audience. They called out “Thank you!” to the applauding group at the very back of the amphitheater. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band’s first few songs were mellow and jazzy, reminiscent of coffee-house tunes to match the laid-back atmosphere of the event. The songs were heavy on the drums, with drummer Will Hettel laying down a slow but strong beat that pounded through the space. The beginning of the set had an improvisational feel as each song had an occasional piano solo. Andrew Mac Innes mixed up his steady pops of keyboard with sweeping scales and fast trills of notes. Guitar solos were common as well as Kehke held out long, wavering notes combined with quick, short bursts of riffing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Pagliassotti’s steady bass transitioned into quick, accented strumming as the beat began to pick up. Quick bursts from Mac Innes’s keyboard mirrored the faster bass line. Hettel’s drumming grew louder and faster as Kehke’s hands flew up and down the guitar in frequent, wailing riffs. The pace never stayed too intense for too long, however, as the music quickly softened again to more mellow rhythms. Savage Henry’s atmospheric yet still distinct style at the event was a welcome sound for many after being away from Isla Vista all summer.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73266\" style=\"width: 252px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1581113689\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73282\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73266\" data-attachment-id=\"73266\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/file_006/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?fit=300%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"file_006\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73266\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/File_006-e1476844635417.jpeg?resize=242%2C362\" alt=\"Kaityln Haberlin / Daily Nexus\" width=\"242\" height=\"362\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kaityln Haberlin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next band to the stage was The NITWITS, giving event-goers a more rock-n-roll style to enjoy. Graham Bunce’s upbeat, catchy bass line got the audience bobbing their heads and swaying to the beat from the very beginning, as spontaneous bursts of drums and symbols added a flair of excited energy to the song. Drummer Ryan Lowe demonstrated his talent with seemingly no effort, his sticks flying across the drums and every beat strong and intense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While singer and guitarist Bryan Rawn’s raspy voice was very characteristic of classic alternative rock, it was actually because he was under the weather, not imitating singers from the ‘90s. “As you can probably tell, I’m a little sick,” the singer apologized with a smile, “but you know what, we’re having fun!” The band had to stop one song because Rawn’s weakened voice wasn’t strong enough for the vocals, but they picked up again right away with another high-tempo number. Rawn hit impressive high notes with all his might and kept the song’s energy up with fast guitar strumming and stylish riffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who were new to the Isla Vista community or simply those who have been away for a while, the concert was an inclusive opportunity to learn about I.V. living while also getting a taste of the local talent. The organizations and bands of Isla Vista are here to kick off another great school year. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73282\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73282\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/","id":6731,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6730,6729,6728],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
