My freshman year, I covered the Olés for Artsweek a number of times, a band that played shows almost every weekend­­ — eventually bringing their sun-drenched brand of reggae to headlining concerts and festivals. Last year, I wrote about Savage Henry quite a bit, giving them both recognition and praise for their hazy, blues-tinged garage rock that they became known for. Members of these bands have graduated, and with their departure, they have made room for new acts to join our town’s music scene.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, we brought the Mallards into the <em>Nexus</em> office to play a session in the Batcave. They’re a four-piece originally formed three years ago by lead vocalist Matt Swiacki and vocalist Blake Berich. As fate would have it, they met in the freshman dorms after being randomly assigned to each other. Soon enough, they began playing together and found their individual voices as a duo. They didn’t officially form a full band until last year, when drummer Jake Morenc befriended the duo during a chess game and bassist Ray Muhlencamp joined a jam session.</p>\n<p>The Mallards have started making their way through the backyard show scene this year, and have been playing live ever since. Their ties to other Isla Vista acts are strong: Robert Sanlis of This is Napoleon? mixed, mastered and recorded their debut EP last summer. The group is extremely proud of the finished product, <em>Fowl Play</em>, which can be found on both Spotify and Apple Music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Isla Vista is a great place for a band to form, but sometimes finding space to practice becomes a challenge. We all share one square mile of land, so music travels incredibly far, especially since most spaces where a band could facilitate practice sessions are outside. The Mallards have been kicked out of eight places total because of noise complaints, including parking garages, dorms and even the marine science building on campus. However, the struggle to come together during the week is rewarded on Friday and Saturday nights when crowds gather to dance, party and listen to what they’ve created.</p>\n<p>Just like its wonderful name, Milk Drunk has crafted a carefree, punk aesthetic. Members Kellan Staninger, Ethan Jones and Aaron Kopperman met through frequenting shows in the area, as they share a love for the local DIY scene. Milk Drunk was officially formed last spring and has been working hard ever since.</p>\n<p>In addition to playing shows both on and off campus, the three piece already has two EPs on their Bandcamp page. It is clear that their sound is heavily informed by their influences, from Car Seat Headrest to the Story So Far — all big names in the indie world that have major influence over new acts. However, they don’t attempt to replicate these bands and instead aim to make a sound unique to both Isla Vista and the music world at large. Guitarist and vocalist Jones describes their sound as “post-ska, pre-country,” which is a label you’ll only understand if you listen for yourself.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80449\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1050951179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80447\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80449\" data-attachment-id=\"80449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/new-talent-isla-vista-bands-to-watch-in-2018/iv-bands-online-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Bands ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80449\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Mallards</p></div>\n<p>Considering the notorious emphasis on partying Isla Vista tends to have during weekends, sometimes the focus for showgoers is not the music itself. Because of this, Milk Drunk believes that many bands in Isla Vista make an attempt to play it safe in an effort to please everyone. Of course, it is difficult to keep the local DIY scene alive if all of the bands are aiming for a similar sound. However, Milk Drunk cites fellow Isla Vista band RabbitFoot as another band to see — the show that they put on is, in a word, unique.</p>\n<p>Lord BunNy, also known as Cris Sharma, is the vocalist and guitarist for RabbitFoot. He started the band with lead guitarist Malcom Coffman a couple of years ago, then bassist Ricardo Valenzuela-Morin joined and drummer Yarden Refaely followed. The band plays a self-described mix of “latin jazz, bossa nova, folk, alternative and punk,” which they also showcase on weekends during house party shows.</p>\n<p>RabbitFoot has had a number of shows shut down in Isla Vista, possibly due to the hard-hitting nature of their shows. They rebel against the tame nature of popular indie music, and like their peers, they are creating something different. Their energy comes at you quick, and can be a little strange — but in the best way possible.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, it is difficult to maintain a band and write original songs, all while working and taking multiple classes. Somehow, these guys do it all­­ — and play shows on the weekends, too.

Hailing from New York and remaining prominent in the indie scene since 2010, the success of this band comes from honest lyricism, talented instrumentalists and a dreamy pop-rock flow reminiscent of ’80s legends The Smiths and Joy Division. The Drums have remained important in a highly dynamic industry despite acts like Real Estate and Twin Peaks that utilize similar sonic qualities and aesthetics. These aesthetics have been refined and mastered by The Drums and the brilliant sonic landscapes are coming to SOhO in Downtown Santa Barbara on April 18 for a show of dancing and deliberation.</p>\n<p>The Drums were first formed in 2009 and shortly thereafter released their self-titled debut album, which was met with limited critical reception and audience consumption. The album, much like their earlier work, featured a heavy Beach Boys influence sonically and was followed up by <em>Portamento</em> in 2011 and <em>Encyclopedia</em> in 2014. These critical years cemented The Drums as a band with a very strong and consistent sound and put them on the map in the indie community. After a lengthy break that was partially due to creative differences, the group came back with the bold, sonic work <em>Abysmal Thoughts</em>, which ensured the enduring creativity of The Drums and solidified the group as a lasting force.</p>\n<p>Childhood friends and group founders lead singer Jonny Pierce and keyboard player Jacob Graham founded The Drums after meeting as preteens and later linked up with  Adam Kessler and Connor Hanwick to realize their vision. Both of the latter members left after the release of <em>Portamento</em>, which almost resulted in the full retirement of The Drums. However, original group members Pierce and Graham have gone forward recording themselves and touring with a separate set of musicians.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The dream rockers recently released a single entitled “Meet Me in Mexico,” which was released in support of Mexican earthquake relief efforts. The track includes Pierce briefly singing in Spanish and showcases a more experimental approach that is featured more in their newer work. The Drums have recently used a more electronic edge to their music with more synthesized and spacey tones, taking the previous influence of the ’80s and twisting it into their own unique modern context.</p>\n<p>The Drums will be playing at SOhO between weekend appearances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and are currently doing some shows with Canadian powerhouse Alvvays. Their current string of dates includes mainly a number of stops up and down the California coast and eventually heads down to Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru and back up to El Paso, Texas. The band, however, is no stranger to back-to-back live performances, as they have toured extensively on the West and East coasts, internationally and, more notably, at major festivals such as Outside Lands, L.A.’s FYF and indie-rock counterpart the Growlers’ festival, Beach Goth.</p>\n<p>It is common in discussion of artists like The Drums to mention that the group is sure to blow up soon, but in this context this is not necessarily the case. The Drums are a smaller indie-rock band with a strong cult following but have found success in the niche sound that they know how to do best. Luckily for them and their audience, this is in no way a bad thing. The Drums are not the next huge name on a festival lineup but are very satisfying and talented young musicians that will remain successful with the tools that they have. More importantly, The Drums make gorgeous music that brings people together.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Perhaps James Taylor said it best: “I’ve seen fire and I’ve seen rain,” … but have you ever seen </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thunder?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launching his career in the early 2000s, Stephen Bruner, aka Thundercat, established himself as a bassist. 2015 proved to be a notorious year for the seasoned musician, bringing about “them changes” as he distinguished himself on Kendrick Lamar’s celebrated album “To Pimp a Butterfly.” As well, Thundercat released “The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam,” containing hits that acid jazz and electronica enthusiasts still praise to this day. But just as every inventive artist knows, interest ultimately dwindles unless it can be matched with something newer, or maybe even better. And that, my friends, is just what Thundercat has accomplished with his 2020 poetic piece of genius: “It Is What It Is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just enough musical content for a simple drive around town or a walk with a dog, Thundercat managed to condense his entire album into a 37-minute masterpiece. Varying between five-minute ballads to one-minute snippets, the pace ebbs and flows throughout the album. Beginning with quite possibly the most obscure title of all time, “Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26” has a mocking resemblance to a lullaby. Asking the question, “Is it time to go?” sets a rather ominous tone for the short track, lasting only one minute and 22 seconds. But maybe you’re thinking like me, and asking, “What on Earth does this title mean?” Well, “Great Scott!” is a phrase notoriously exclaimed in the ‘80s classic film “Back to the Future,” and to my surprise, “22-26” is a biblical reference to the guardian angels that appear in Numbers 22:26. Kinda, dare I say, out of this world, right?</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

His next song “Innerstellar Love” has just a simple six lines of verse, and the rest is a jazz ensemble that takes you soaring to new heights. I suppose that’s where the “acid jazz” genre makes its debut. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proceeding ballad brings the listener down a nostalgic road of friendship with Thundercat and seemingly, Louis Cole. After all, the song is called “I Love Louis Cole,”  who is a fellow artist and internet personality. Thundercat similarly appears on his buddy’s track, “Tunnels In The Air.” Must be good friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bringing us back to the contemporary R&amp;B classics, Thundercat employs Steve Arrington, Steve Lacy and Childish Gambino on his track, “Black Qualls.” Lyrics like “‘Cause there’s no more livin’ in fear” debut itself as the central theme of the song, walking us listeners through the process of perseverance during troubling times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going solo in his next happy lil’ bop, “Miguel’s Happy Dance” reminds us to essentially smile through the pain, but instead of smiling, we’re dancing. It’s quite refreshing to see such a positive kick on this album.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How Sway” takes on an entirely different approach, sounding somewhere between the Mario Kart Rainbow Road theme and the start of a SoundCloud rap. All I can say is it’s a total hype-up jam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thundercat and Zack Fox make sure to remind us of the long lost spring break action we all missed out this year in “Overseas,” detailing all the exclusive vacation spots they plan to take their “girl” to. Fox’s outro on the airplane intercom lets you imagine you’re en route to that awesome bender that’s been so rudely revoked from you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His second-most acclaimed song, “Dragonball Durag,” brings out the self-consciousness in all of us, constantly asking about how we look, whether or not we are in a durag. With a similar sound to “Them Changes,” it’s no wonder the crowd went wild for this hit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going largely sans lyric yet again, “How I Feel” contains all the necessary “oohs” to make this track work. Thundercat really hit the nail on the head with this one because sometimes, words just can’t explain </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how we feel</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bit softer and slower, “Unrequited Love” reminisces on the pains of one-sided relationships, and it will no doubt bring a tear to the listener’s eye. Appearing in an anime series “Carole &amp; Tuesday,” Thundercat reveals his taste for unraveling deeper meanings of animated filmography, a distinguishing quality of the artist himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And don’t think that this is the only song that will tug at your heartstrings. Thundercat, Ty Dolla $ign and Lil B capture the emotions of mourning artists in response to Mac Miller’s death in the track “Fair Chance.” The grief felt is not one easily overcome, which is highlighted throughout the song’s duration. And his next 52-second debrief hardly lightens the mood. “Existential Dread” reminds us that we are “not sure of what’s coming next,” which is quite a hard pill to swallow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reaching the end of the album, Thundercat and Pedro Martins end on a song with the same name as the album title, “It Is What It Is,” spending five minutes drifting off into the endless abyss of learning to move forward and let go. Dreamy and mellow, the ballad puts to bed an album filled with razzy-dazzy delirium and mnemonic memories that both the seasoned soul fan and funk freshie can jam to all day, every day. And while we might all might be stuck inside, fury-filled and somber, just remember, “It is what it is!” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hgeorge/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah George</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah George is an Artsweek writer for the Daily Nexus.

our emotions. As we age, the number of obstacles we face increases (as does our frustration), so we cope through any outlet we see fit. There are a variety of ways to go about this, but most people choose to turn to music. The alluring comfort that comes with being able to find yourself in a song and letting it wash your troubles away is the reason I listen to music, and is a feeling bands like Blink-182 have mastered the art of creating.</p>\n<p>Blink-182 initially formed in Poway, California in 1992, but went into hiatus in 2005 after the departure of guitarist Tom DeLonge. The band rejoined forces in 2009, releasing their sixth album <em>Neighborhoods</em> two years later. However, DeLonge quit once again and was replaced by the band’s current guitarist/vocalist, Matt Skiba. With the recent release of their newest album <em>California</em>, Blink-182 embarked on a long-awaited tour across the country and will be bringing their adolescence-inspired pop-punk anthems to Santa Barbara Bowl Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>One would expect the band to have shifted their sound completely after making music for so long and going through several changes, but it is evident how much effort has gone into staying true to the core of their signature sound. <em>California</em> is nearly flawless when it comes to embodying the evolution of Blink-182’s sound, yet highlights the band’s fingerprint in each track, signaling “we’re still the same old band.” It includes angst-filled tales and anthems like “Bored to Death” and “Sober” that parallel with classic songs like “First Date” and “All the Small Things.” However, Blink does not neglect to appeal to the heart in a soulful ode to their home state, titled “California.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pop-punk mainstays A Day to Remember and All-American Rejects will both be sharing the stage with Blink-182. All three acts have been in the genre for quite some time, so it is seemingly inevitable to come across one of their songs. If you grew up in the mid-2000s like me, then songs like “I Miss You” and “It Ends Tonight” are included in the soundtrack of your childhood. It goes without saying that if you’re punk and you’re proud, this is a show you will not want to miss.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>From its inception in 2012, Día de los Muertos at the Santa Barbara Bowl has been a jubilant and exciting celebration of local culture. Featuring theatre performances, art installations, dance groups, altars to remember our loved ones lost and live music (like last year’s incredible sets by Bomba Esteréo and Chicano Batman), the Day of the Dead celebration seemed perfectly whole, in need of no further improvement.</p>\n<p>And then they booked Morrissey.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 4, Moz himself will be performing at the Bowl, with support by the Mexican Institute of Sound and Rubén Albarrán. Pay attention on that Friday night, because chances are the streets of Santa Barbara are about to get both a lot more sincere and a little more sexually ambiguous. Here, Morrissey will be kicking off an international tour, immediately following his headlining appearance at Chicago’s Riot Fest.  He most recently released the <em>World Peace is None of Your Business</em> LP on Harvest Records, receiving a solid reception from critics and charting highly in both the U.K. and U.S.</p>\n<p>The Irish-English indie rock crooner has always had an incredibly strong fan base within the Chicano community, but is that really so strange? Morrissey’s songwriting style in many ways parallels traditional Mexican music genres such as <em>ranchero</em>; both are often intensely personal expressions about love, and they tackle issues of national identity as well. The notion of otherness, of continuously feeling like an outsider, also pervades Morrissey’s work in a way many Mexican-Americans find highly relatable. The sense of split cultural identity is a familiar one, as some immigrants to areas like Southern California may feel like they completely belong neither here nor back in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Morrissey’s parents migrated to Manchester from Dublin a year before his birth, and many of his lyrics deal with his sense of identity as an immigrant as well as an Englishman.  In the first half of his career, Moz fought against the appropriation and twisting of British identity by Margaret Thatcher and the neoliberal administration in the U.K. of the 1980s. During this time he was the lead singer of indie rock band The Smiths, which some have praised as being the most influential rock group of all time. In his time with The Smiths, Morrissey acted as an anti-pop icon, creating a bookish, quiet persona in stark contrast to the pageantry and glam of other contemporary pop groups. He dressed in cardigans and National Health Service glasses, and wore his celibacy like a badge of honor. He was so uncool that cool stopped looking appealing.</p>\n<p>In addition to dozens of other accolades, Morrissey is also regarded as one of the best British lyricists of all time. “I am human and I need to be loved,” “You can pin and mount me like a butterfly,” “Why do I smile at people who I’d much rather kick in the eye?” I could literally do this all day. The crippling sincerity of his words is still unmatched in the musical canon (although Yo La Tengo, Cat Power and others have come close).</p>\n<p>Having attended last year, I can attest that Santa Barbara’s Dia de los Muertos celebration is a wild and freakish ride, and sure to be made all the more so by the appearance of the sweet and tender hooligan himself. Do you think about life and death and find that neither of them particularly appeals to you? Well, think about seeing the most morbid man on Earth at a death-themed holiday celebration. It just might.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/","id":6663,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6662,6661,6660],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
