You’ll want to see these guys play at home, where they went a perfect 9-0 last season, setting a program record. They’ll also be recharged with a recruiting class that was ranked No. 15 in the nation.</p>\n<p><strong>SW –</strong> The past few seasons have been an ascending slope for UCSB men’s tennis. Dominating the Big West Conference, the Gauchos have been crowned Big West champions in two of the last three years. The team’s progression is not coming to a halt any time soon. It ended this offseason with the No. 15 recruiting class in the nation as it welcomed four new recruits and concluded this past season with a No. 52 national ranking at a 15-10 overall record, 3-2 Big West co-record, and NCAA Tournament visit. Much credit must be given to long-time Head Coach Marty Davis who has helped guide UCSB’s tennis program to win a total of nine conference titles.

Finishing during late-game situations is the key improvement to look out for when watching this team this year as it has struggled in the past. Expect players such as Samantha Murphy, Bryn Hudson, Camila Schafer, who all received All-Big West honors, and Orange County’s Female Player of the Year freshman Sarah Kreiser to carry the load for UCSB.</p>\n<p>First Game: 10/2 Triton Invitational</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Men’s Volleyball</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64545\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"657321405\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64540\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64545\" data-attachment-id=\"64545\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/sports-arenas-for-print_by-lorenzo-basilio-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1440589371\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Daily Nexus/Lorenzo Basilio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64545\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?resize=278%2C186\" alt=\"Men's volleyball benefited from its home-field advantage in games with an 11-4 record in Robertson Gym last season.

Two-time All-American setter Jonah Seif will look to go out with a bang as he leads UCSB in his final year.</p>\n<p><strong>SW –</strong> Arguably one of the most slept-on sports programs at UCSB, men’s volleyball has quietly made a reputation for itself as a top team in the nation. Despite losing to No. 7 Pepperdine in the MPSF Tournament Quarterfinals, the Gauchos finished last season with a No. 13 national ranking along with a 17-10 overall record and 13-9 conference record. Led by Head Coach Rick McLaughlin, the Gauchos set Robertson Gym ablaze with its fiery offensive attack. In 14 of the team’s 27 games played, UCSB won in straight sets, sweeping its opponents each time. Although the Gauchos lost seniors Weston Nielson, Kevin Donohue and Jake Staahl, UCSB has enough talent in hopes of making it to a NCAA National Championship like it did in 2011.</p>\n<p>First Game: January 2016</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Women’s Volleyball</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach: Nicole Lantagne Welch<br>\nRecord: 13-14 Overall, 8-8 Conf</p>\n<p>One season after finishing in first place in the Big West, a young Gaucho team found itself in the middle of the standings in 2014.

His work has not gone unnoticed as he was rewarded with the Big West Men’s Cross Country Coach of the Year award this past season. While Dolan is the mastermind behind the Gauchos’ gameplan heading into races, having a stud athlete like senior Bryan Guijarro is very rewarding. He is the first Gaucho to win the Big West Men’s Cross Country Athlete of the Year since 2005, and is expected to have an outstanding season after helping lead UCSB to its school record low score of 21 in the conference championships. Representing UCSB’s women’s team is senior distance runner Victoria Tsolis. After earning a NCAA first round bid last season, her final year is another opportunity for her to continue to climb up the UCSB record books.</p>\n<p>First Meet: 9/5 vs. Cal Poly</p>\n<p><strong>Track &amp; Field</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach: Pete Dolan<br>\nTeam Stats: A total of three Gauchos participated in the NCAA Championships this past season</p>\n<p>Along with cross country, UCSB’s men’s and women’s track and field teams made progressive strides during the 2014 season. While the talents of former Gauchos Jessica Johnson, Albert Hughes and Thomas Gore-Schreck will be missed, UCSB made sure it had a productive offseason with a total of 22 signees. After a second place finish by the men’s and a fourth place ranking by the women’s in the Big West Championships, UCSB is on the brink of having a breakout year.</p>\n<p>First Meet: February 2016</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/","id":3291,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3290,3289,3288],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Research Recruitment App To Launch at UCSB This Fall","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Psychology-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Psychology-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Not only will Ugig benefit UCSB researchers, but it can grant students an opportunity to find, participate and profit from studies on a straightforward platform.

Firestone and Akuamoah-Boateng pitched Ugig to a group of other students at the competition, where they met fourth-year political science major Cole Parker, who now acts as the marketing section of their team, and UCSB alumnus Justin Hemphill, who later joined the team to focus on software development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project earned third place and $5,000 to continue developing the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two co-founders were also invited to continue development of the application through the UCSB Office of Research at the Mosher Alumni House and plan to launch a beta version in the fall with both a web and mobile interface, Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are extremely grateful for the Office of Research at UCSB. They have been really gracious and willing to work with and believe in us. We could not think of a better university to start a company at,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair chose the name “Ugig” for several reasons; the ‘u’ represents both the university and the individual by providing a platform for people to profit from sharing personal data. The ‘gig’ part of the name refers to a job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Firestone’s experience as a researcher over the summer, the majority of his time was spent recruiting people for their research studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Opportunities are not widely available for the general public to know about or participate in. So that’s really the first problem that we are trying to address with our app,” Firestone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only will Ugig benefit UCSB researchers, but it can grant students an opportunity to find, participate and profit from studies on a straightforward platform, according to Hemphill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parker said that the university system for getting participants is flawed in its effectiveness, but also tarnishes the quality of research produced. The main method for participation is through unpaid course credit completed by students who are often taking multiple classes in that field, which is not representative of the general population, Akuamoah-Boateng explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After interviewing professors and researchers at multiple universities, the Ugig team found it was a common issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a university setting, recruitment is really decentralized, and they are often recruiting primarily from their own department, but they are running studies meant to assess the general population. So our platform is meant to get anyone who wants to contribute to research in the local area,” Parker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig is unique in that it is the first company focused on recruiting sample sizes that better represent the general population, Firestone said. While many departments at UCSB already utilize software for managing research studies, namely Sona Systems, the team has heard from various professors that recruitment is still a challenge, especially outside of each department, according to Firestone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sona does also connect [researchers and participants]. The problem you see with Sona is that they’re not actually actively recruiting. For us, we think it is important to involve and market to the student body, the research that takes place at UCSB,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In reality, we are changing the model, and while disrupting the current technology, are working in such an underserved space,” Firestone said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig will be starting small with beta testing before releasing it to the public. The team has the goal of getting almost every study at UCSB on their interface by the beginning of the 2020-21 academic year, Hemphill said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe this app has greater implications for research as a whole. Our mission goes past the university scale,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-89947\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if people feel like their mental health is fine, Tatum Katz recommends that everyone see mental health professionals. </span><em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for students who have never had access to mental health resources before, whether it’s for financial, cultural or other reasons, Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) can be a student’s first foray into addressing mental health issues — a vital first step that, for some, can be a lifesaver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hilary Ochoa, a fourth-year Chicano studies major, just marked her first full year of C.A.P.S. counseling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had always wanted to go [to counseling],” Ochoa said. “I feel like I had a lot of things from my childhood that I wanted to talk about. My home life was never the best, and I struggled with anxiety in high school.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa went to C.A.P.S. for the first time during her second year of college, after being referred by Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.). Her first experience with a therapist, however, wasn’t what she had wanted it to be — namely because Ochoa felt like her therapist, a white woman, didn’t understand her and her experiences as a Mexican woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I couldn’t relate to her at all,” Ochoa said. “I found that now that I [have] found a different therapist that I really needed somebody who understood my background.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa didn’t return to C.A.P.S. until the beginning of last summer, after a quarter of academic troubles and the looming threat of academic disqualification. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Ochoa, “going home [wasn’t] an option,” so she decided to spend the summer in Isla Vista and work while she figured out her next steps; during that time, she heard about a new therapist at C.A.P.S., Jessica Adams, who Ochoa said was Puerto Rican and spoke Spanish. She decided to give C.A.P.S. a second chance and booked an appointment with Adams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like she listened and I felt like she was actually helping me and I felt like I was getting the help that I needed,” Ochoa said. “And that was from the first time that I met her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa noted that Adams was able to “catch onto things that [she] hadn’t told her yet,” which reassured her that her new therapist was a good fit for her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Ochoa said she spent her sessions learning to cope with her anxiety and to notice when her depression was getting worse. It’s a victory for Ochoa that she now goes to sessions every few weeks, versus her weekly appointments when she first started out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Adams] has given me a lot of tools to kind of focus and cope with things on my own to get myself out of certain ruts,” Ochoa said, adding that she sees herself continuing counseling after she graduates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reason Ochoa had the opportunity to access therapy was because she was on a college campus, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Talking about mental health] was honestly something new to me,” Ochoa said. “My mom didn’t really talk about that, she was just like, ‘Oh, no you aren’t depressed, you’re just lazy,’ ‘What do you even have to be depressed about,’ or I don’t even think she knows what anxiety is, still.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She comes from Mexico, and it’s a hard thing to talk about… And it’s so easy for her to dismiss mental health.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several other students who spoke about their experience seeking mental health help noted that it was the combination of stigma within their families in addition to the financial burden that prevented them from seeking help before they went to college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tatum Katz, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Ecology, Evolution &amp; Marine Biology, first went to therapy as an undergraduate at Occidental College in Los Angeles. At home, her parents didn’t believe in mental illness and she didn’t have insurance, so “it was just not a possibility” for her to get help.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Katz, seeking therapy at Occidental was “more of a reaction to a crisis, and a lack of understanding of myself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s continued counseling while at UCSB and now describes mental health as “something that I need to do and need to stay on top of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if people feel like their mental health is fine, Katz recommends that everyone see mental health professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get a physical every year, you get your blood work, you get your shots or whatever, you should do that with your mental health,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But C.A.P.S. doesn’t have to be just for students with long-term mental health problems — for some, C.A.P.S. has helped those who run into crises during their college years, such as Marisol Gonzalez, a fourth-year linguistics major who first went to C.A.P.S. after her close family member had a stroke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was her first time seeking mental health resources and while she doesn’t see herself continuing therapy after college, she said she was glad to be able to take advantage of the resource during the distressing time period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t able to focus on school or just anything. I tried going to class, but I just ended up crying all over campus, and I was just a mess,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interviewees recommended that incoming students try C.A.P.S., many acknowledged how difficult it can be to get appointments and how that may impact students who are asking for help for the first time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. Director Brian Olowude said that the office had recently hired a handful of psychologists and were “constantly looking at [their] available hours” in order to meet student demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that while staff had increased by 50% over the last five years, “initial contacts” with students had increased 127%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. is currently working on developing its first-ever annual report, set to be released in the next month or so, which will include information about how many people the office had seen in the past year and what services were provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude said that about 16% of the campus uses C.A.P.S.’s services, compared to the six to 13% of college students who use mental health services on college campuses nationally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say confidently that access to mental health services at UCSB will probably outpace [students’] access in the community when they leave here,” Olowude added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to offering short-term counseling services in their offices, C.A.P.S. also provides community referrals for long-term counseling options in the community — one of which is Acacia Counseling, a clinic in Isla Vista that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/acacia-counseling-wellness-supports-ucsb-students-mental-health/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solely to provide accessible long-term counseling options for UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main areas that Acacia Counseling specializes in is helping students through the development of their identities through formative college years, which is why it’s important for them to staff their offices with clinicians who reflect the population they serve, Kristen Strong, director of the center, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude also emphasized that, as UCSB is a “minority-serving institution,” it’s important for C.A.P.S. psychologists to be reflective of their diverse clientele. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude and Strong both emphasized that students should take their time finding the right therapists for themselves, and that the first therapist they see may not always be the right fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You might not fit culturally, you might not fit personality-wise, and that’s not anything necessarily bad,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ochoa echoed Strong and Olowude’s sentiments about putting in the effort to find the right therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially for people of color, I would really suggest to try to find somebody who you can relate to, who looks like you,” she said. “A lot of my mental health issues came from my childhood and growing up… so people not understanding the cultural aspect of a person, I feel impedes you getting the best help that you can get.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
