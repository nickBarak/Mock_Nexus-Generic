After achieving a cult following with the 2017 “Rina” EP, she began to work on branching out in new directions. “SAWAYAMA” was the result, and it was released to widespread critical acclaim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first single, “STFU!” is a heavy-metal rock anthem addressing the constant stereotyping she feels as a Japanese bisexual woman in the music industry. In the song, she tells her doubters, “Shut the fuck up!/Have you ever thought about taping your big mouth shut?/’Cause I have, many times, many times.” Though the verses are filled with a foot-stomping, headbanging beat, the choruses switch gears completely and are delivered in a sweeter tone, much like artist Poppy’s recent ventures into playing with juxtaposing nu-metal and pop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Comme Des Garçons (Like The Boys),” is a slinky dance anthem with a killer baseline, perfect for the background music to a runway in Paris. This song sounds expensive, like Sawayama is charging you $50 just to listen to it. Comme Des Garçons, a Japanese fashion brand, along with other high fashion brands are mentioned throughout the song, giving it a feeling of luxury (“Miu Miu, Prada, Mugler, Virgil, Ross, Nicola/Elevate your vision when you put me on the cover”). However, the title also gives context to Rina’s confidence, saying she’s “like the boys,” the translation of “Comme Des Garçons.” These two themes of the song take shape in the raspy raplike post-choruses, where Sawayama flaunts, “Excuse my ego, can’t go incognito/Every time you see me, it’s like winning big in Reno.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Chilling lyrics such as “(Anything to carry down our)/Dynasty/The pain in my vein is hereditary/Dynasty/Running in my bloodstream, my bloodstream” paired with a regal chorus and soaring background vocals makes for an intense and dramatic effect. I work up a sweat every time I listen to the post-chorus bridge, which layers Sawayama’s high notes with an electric guitar solo, eventually exploding into the last chorus. The song, much like others on the album, touches on family trauma during her teenage years. Feeling a responsibility to make sure her kids have a better life, she pleads, “Won’t you break the chain with me?” It’s a moving, forceful opening that sets the album’s tone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed the sample of rock Sawayama presents on “STFU!,” look no further than “Who’s Gonna Save U Now?” to see her really have fun with the genre. Against the background of a screaming audience</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rinasawayama_jp/status/1249715668171145216\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inspired by “A Star Is Born” (2018) and its pop-rock songs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sawayama says goodbye to the people in her life she tried to better for, only to be let down by them. “This ain’t no absolution/I needed a resolution/Good luck in your evolution,” she says as she wishes them gone. Another song experimenting with a past genre is “Love Me 4 Me,” a head-to-toe late-90s Britney Spears song, showing Sawayama’s appreciation and knowledge of pop music that came before her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Akasaka Sad” is a lament that plays on the name of Akasaka, a district in Tokyo that Sawayama frequently visits. Born in Japan and raised in London, she has often felt stuck between the two areas, leading to the dispiriting feeling of not belonging in either. “Akasaka sad, I guess I’ll be sad/Forever and ever and ever/Wherever I go, forever,” she admits. Like “Dynasty,” this song is about family, mentioning that Sawayama’s feelings emulate how her parents felt when they first immigrated to London. On lines like “‘Cause I’m a sucker, sucker, so I suffer/Akasaka Sawayama/Just like my mother,” her authenticity shines through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only real misstep on the album is “Chosen Family,” which has a nice narrative message: Growing close with someone even though you’re not related. The lyrics are so on the nose, however, throwing in every buzzword related to genetics and family (“We don’t need to be related to relate/We don’t need to share genes or a surname.”) that it begins to sound more like a parody of a ballad. There are much more powerful moments on the record despite a faster BPM, like the Zedd-inspired “Bad Friend” about a memorable night with a now-distant friend. It’s a deep, introspective look at herself after a falling out with a best friend which, Sawayama said, “</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rinasawayama_jp/status/1249526953800912896\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made me point the mirror at myself and look at my own insecurities that make me sabotage friendships</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album closes with “Snakeskin,” an eclectic song that includes both </span><a href=\"https://genius.com/Rina-sawayama-snakeskin-lyrics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a Beethoven sample and an interpolation of the Final Fantasy IX Victory Fanfare</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It includes some of the most interesting and descriptive lines so far, like “Buy my exclusive, expensive, pain wear/My </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fine couture is your branded repayment/I tear my soul into two so that you can/</span><a href=\"https://genius.com/Rina-sawayama-snakeskin-lyrics#note-19591314\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P-p-p-pretend despair</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” The song is likened to a snakeskin handbag, serving as a metaphor for the commercialization of music. Sawayama talks about her art coming from deep within herself and how odd it is that people can readily access, purchase, and hear her pain. It steadily increases in tempo and feels like an epic video game boss fight, a perfect ending to an album influenced by a wide variety of ar</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t forms. It’s dramatic, moving and deeply personal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On her debut album, Rina Sawayama plays with many genres, but each is examined so meticulously it feels like she’s a jack of all trades that can go in any direction in the future. It explores culture, family, friendships, loneliness, love, fun, deep sadness and pain all in its quick 43-minute runtime, while never seeming too condensed. If anything, it’s an energizing rollercoaster ride with many turns — one that always comes back to a neat and tidy end.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Album rating: 9/10</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

Their first three albums sound like no one else’s, and all of them are among the best rap albums of 2017, so Brockhampton may not remain on the periphery of mainstr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet’s favorite boy band just solidified themselves as a hip-hop powerhouse and cultural force. Brockhampton released the third installment of their </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trilogy no more than seven months after the first gave them passionate fans and critical acclaim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They open up </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation III</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like a frenetic cartoon intro. The soundscapes are vibrant and colorful, bouncing off walls and breaking your grandmother’s vases. “Boogie”’s blaring saxophones, driving bass and revving synths provide the perfect backdrop for all of the collective’s go-to vocalists to introduce themselves as the zany characters that will entertain you for the duration of this broadcast. I can practically see their brightly-colored names flashing by as they each deliver bite-sized verses even catchier than your average radio-ready hook.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brockhampton set the tone for an album whose dynamism would distinguish it from both </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation II</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation III</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the verses are much less predictably sized and layered. With the exception of Ameer Vann’s use of a sauntering, pause-heavy, one-two flow, Brockhampton restrains themselves from leaning on devices in danger of becoming tired gimmicks. The chipped vocals that appear frequently on the group’s material and are most apparent on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s “Fake” and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation II</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s “Jello” have almost died out. In fact, Kevin Abstract’s are the only vocals that undergo digital pitch manipulation on this album. The man is a hook machine. Since he’s all over the project supplying refrains and bridges as well as verses, it only serves to benefit the diversity of Brockhampton’s sound. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

And there are at least five beats in it! And no, “Sister/Nation” is not even close to sounding like an unlistenable jumble. It’s actually the best song on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturation III</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and arguably the best song the group’s put out as of yet. In it, they maneuver a toggling transition from untethered insanity to understated meditation so expertly as to tell a story of internal conflict, external pressure and defiant ambition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this song alone, production borrows from industrial, psychedelic, electro and pop music. The whole album sports an eclectic set of influences. “Hottie” is about as close to mid- to late-2000s indie pop a hip-hop group can sound without literally being MGMT. They translate that synthy, dancy music to modern hip-hop, and the result is a soft-hearted tune inseparable from the angst of the restless discomfort of childhood. It’s a song where Merlyn Wood can rap “Man, I wish I had a rocket/Wish I ain’t feel microscopic/Wish my thoughts was telepathic” and you can feel yourself melt a little.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soul and flow of R&amp;B infects the tracks “Bleach” and “Rental.” You can even catch Matt Champion </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">singing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on “Rental.” This is the same Matt Champion whose low-key persona and laid-back delivery is probably the most fitting for Brockhampton’s predominantly West Coast rap sound, and he’s actually a good singer. His pre-chorus and bridge provide a sexy and sleek quality that makes “Rental” what it is: a glossy and smooth piece of pop rap. It makes me wish he would sing more. And maybe he will — Brockhampton has already announced the 2018 release of their next album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team Effort</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brockhampton just doesn’t stop. Their first three albums sound like no one else’s, and all of them are among the best rap albums of 2017, so Brockhampton may not remain on the periphery of mainstream rap for much longer. Their every facet is in-house: production, record label, merchandise, advertising, touring management, etc. In 2017, they made and released thirteen music videos and a short film. Brockhampton may very well be the leading figures in the next era of hip-hop. Rappers and entrepreneurs who grew up on Kanye West and Lil Wayne were raised by the Internet when they were forgotten by everyone else around them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brockhampton met on an online forum for Kanye West fans, and they all moved from Texas to a house in L.A. together to foster an environment of unbridled creative energy. They’re a grassroots boy band. And to say they are the boy band heirs to the throne last held by One Direction (which they say a lot) is to say they are the end of one era and the beginning of another. Whatever that era is, it’s about the Internet. It’s a discussion as diverse as its members and as free as their imagination.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

song “Melanin” bounced off the walls of the multipurpose room of the Student Resource Building, fourth-years Gabby Felder and Nkechi Ikem prepared to present “Femme &amp; Rap” last Tuesday</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an exploration of the presence and impact of black women in the rap and hip-hop genre.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twelve female rappers including Azealia Banks, Lorde Narf, Noname and Lil’ Kim filled the opening slide of the Powerpoint titled “Femme &amp; Rap: How black girls changed rap and hip-hop for the better.” Over the course of an hour Ikem and Felder detailed the onset of black female rappers in the industry, labelled the Godmothers, and moved through the first, second and new waves of hip-hop artists. With each artist they emphasized the role that the specific women had in breaking traditional rap binaries as they reclaimed and redefined the misogynistic and homophobic themes and language commonly found in the genre. Members of the audience were encouraged also to voice their thoughts and ideas on the subject throughout the presentation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ikem and Felder began by describing the Godmothers, the women who boldly laid the foundation for black femme in rap. Among them were artists Roxy Brown, Queen Latifah and Lil’ Kim. In a highly sexualized, male-dominated genre, they explained that the Godmothers each sought ways to claim and depict their own sexuality. They interpreted Lil’ Kim’s song “Suck My Dick” as an expressive and provocative response to the way the men had been and were talking about women in their own songs. With lyrics like “Look I ain’t tryin’ to suck ya / I might not even fuck ya / Just lay me on this bed and give me some head,” Lil’ Kim confidently inverts the traditional roles of men and women.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ikem and Felder then transitioned into what they term the “First Wave” of femme rappers. Artists such as Missy Elliot, Eve and Diamond defined this wave in their mission to make rap more fun, “less street” and more accessible to listeners. As public figures, they focused more on chic presentation and their image as fashion icons. The presenters proceeded to show Missy Elliot’s music video for her iconic song “Work It” to explain the light-hearted musical transition the women took. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation next featured Nicki Minaj and Lil’ Mama on the cover of the “Second Wave” slide. In a transitional period for the genre, non-traditional influences and a distinct sense of sex appeal and femininity started to paint not only the new sound of rap but a new face for the genre. The mention of the women’s involvement in pop crossovers was met with laughter from the audience as Lil’ Mama appeared rapping in Avril Lavigne’s music video for her hit single, “Girlfriend.” Ikem called the integration of rock and rap “groundbreaking,” accrediting the women with paving a path for current/rising rappers like Lil’ Uzi. She continued to point out Minaj’s role in “making hip-hop less serious” and “more creative” as evident in her many ad libs throughout her songs. For the next two minutes we listened to “Nicki Minaj’s Favorite Noises Pt. 1,” a hysterical compilation of “Wobbeley wabba wa wat’s,” “owa’s” and “Ishucumonacoo’s” among other ad libs and shout outs that Minaj uses.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placing their jokes aside, however, Ikem and Felder discussed the racism, colorism and sexism surrounding black femme rappers. In an emotional interview shown to the audience, Banks tackles major issues regarding cultural smudging and appropriation by white female rapper Iggy Azalea, whose success sprouted from a song in which she calls herself a runaway slave master. Despite the growing presence and popularity of black femme rappers, the lack of representation in award shows, magazines, etc. reinforces a much different message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a broad sense, Ikem argues that these women have made hip-hop intersectional. The political science and philosophy major continued, “I think that rap was sort of born out of the struggle of blackness, so…when we think of intersectionality it means a lot more when we combine the struggle of being black with the struggle of being female together, and that makes for more strength and more passion in hip hop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ikem and Felder presented last the “Fuck it, I do what I want” rappers including Angel Haze, Mykki Blanco, Young M.A., Siya and Quay Dash who played a major role in infiltrating the cisgender, heterosexual-dominated rap world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Felder, one of the presenters and a fourth-year ecology evolution and biology anthropology double major, reflected on the importance of the representation of queer rappers: “…Personally growing up as black and queer…seeing these women on screen, seeing the way they act and dress and behave and talk about themselves is relatable to me and something that wasn’t necessarily always seen in other genres of music.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Femme rappers’ presence has forced rap to deal with the anti-queer undercurrent in both the genre’s artists and music.                                                                         </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ikem concluded the presentation with this: “[These rappers have] made so many changes such as addressing …homophobia and introducing new beats, so I would be like, take women and femmes in the rap and hip hop genres seriously.”</span></p>\n<p>https://open.spotify.com/user/12126756700/playlist/7GuyqTNau8gNJCLzSZOHV8</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

artists performed for the moshing, passionate hip-hop heads of Santa Barbara on the Never Had Sh!t Tour. With the amalgamation of softer songs such as “All Bad” and the gritty, upbeat “NEVER,” J.I.D’s album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Never Story</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> successfully exemplifies all elements of a well-rounded hip-hop album. The Atlanta rapper managed to grab the crowd’s attention with his resonating messages and welcoming stage presence at Velvet Jones.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Atlanta, Georgia, both EarthGang and J.I.D were recently signed to J. Cole’s Dreamville Records, attracting a widespread fanbase despite only recently reaching a level of fame. Although it was a late Sunday night, fans were lined up for over an hour around the perimeter of Velvet Jones, anxiously waiting to watch the various performers leading up to J.I.D.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The collaborative performance of Venus and Doc, better known as EarthGang, had the crowd’s adrenaline rushing as they called for the audience to make room for mosh pits, jumping in to crowd surf. Doc appeared on stage in his signature ski mask and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venus wore a shirt representing their new project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robots</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as they performed their most popular songs, many from the album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stray with Rabies</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Toward the end of their part, they brought up four fans to the stage and asked them to dance to their fast-paced rapping, continuing to interact with their audience by extending their arms and jumping onto the railing of the stage.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

His overall production was very intimate with the audience as he explained between songs that everyone should be thankful for what they have, that he came from a difficult background with his brother incarcerated and was influenced negatively by his peers. He also encouraged everyone to follow their dreams and to do what inspires them as he demonstrated by leaving college to pursue music.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Never Story</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes an interesting combination of different aspects of hip hop that makes it distinct from other albums. J.I.D. smoothly transitioned from comical cuts such as “EdEddnEddy” and “Underwear” to fast-paced, hard-hitting tracks. Thunderous song “NEVER” had the audience chaotically bumping into each other, whereas “Hereditary” possessed a more R&amp;B-influenced sound that had the crowd swaying. On a different note, “All Bad” displayed J.I.D’s true singing skills with his soft voice and riffs at the end of his words, that, combined with Mereba’s musical talent, made for a harmonic fusion of voices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year economics major Christine Kim was very impressed by J.I.D’s stage presence, explaining, “The energy that the rapper had completely transferred onto their crowd.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the night, it was very easy to connect with the performers as the small venue welcomed closeness and the performers frequently stopped to talk to the audience about their beliefs. J.I.D explained, “This is a dream come true, I appreciate you all. I hope that something resonates with you tonight. It’s not about turning up or being sad and shit. It’s about expanding yourself and taking something home.” He continues to say, “You can turn the fuck up, go crazy, but listen, too, because it’s fucking valuable for all of us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J.I.D followed by performing an acoustic freestyle, not lifting his voice for even a mere second. The audience was cheering him on, encouraging his long rap and appreciating his lyrical genius.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the spectators relentlessly awaited the next song, J.I.D called up Earthgang onto the stage to perform their collaboration “D/Vision.” Each rapper took their turn belting out the lyrics to their verse while riding on the rapid energy of the fans, who remained energetic despite the long night of hip-hop and dancing.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81071\" style=\"width: 1345px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"748982085\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81070\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81071\" data-attachment-id=\"81071\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/souther-rapper-j-i-d-makes-sb-debut-at-velvet-jones/j-i-d-by-siavash-ghadiri-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=1335%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1335,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"J.I.D. by Siavash Ghadiri ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81071\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=888%2C1330\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1330\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1335&amp;ssl=1 1335w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J.I.D.-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J.I.D finally concluded his performance by bringing up all his openers, such as Mereba, Lute, Chaz French and EarthGang, to join him for the final song, “NEVER,” the single he dropped before releasing the full album and undoubtedly his most popular song to date. The audience was in havoc as he stood on the railing of the stage while rapping, the security even holding on to the back of his shirt ensuring he wouldn’t fall off stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the song ended and the crowd was still moshing, people were cheering in deep appreciation of the immensely talented group of people all standing on stage in conjunction. On tour together, Mereba, Lute, Chaz French, EarthGang and J.I.D took up the small stage as a family, representing the Never Had Sh!t Tour and Dreamville Records with confidence and love for each other and their fans.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81070\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/souther-rapper-j-i-d-makes-sb-debut-at-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81070\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/souther-rapper-j-i-d-makes-sb-debut-at-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/souther-rapper-j-i-d-makes-sb-debut-at-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/souther-rapper-j-i-d-makes-sb-debut-at-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/souther-rapper-j-i-d-makes-sb-debut-at-velvet-jones/","id":6870,"author":{"id":661,"name":"Neha Makkapati"},"related":[6869,6868,6867],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
