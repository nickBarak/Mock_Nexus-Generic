Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team starts conference play with a losing record after being defeated by No. 4 California-Berkeley 12-8 on Saturday and No. 5 Pacific 9-6 on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The two losses snapped the Gauchos’ five-game winning streak and dropped their overall record to 9-4. Santa Barbara now has a 0-2 record to open MPSF play. The Golden Bears improved to 12-2 overall and a 1-0 start in conference play. The Pacific Tigers are in the midst of an impressive 11-game winning streak and are now 11-1 with a 1-0 MPSF record.</p>\n<p>Opening up MPSF play versus Cal was not an unfamiliar situation for UCSB as these two teams met twice earlier this season, the two previous meetings resulting in victories for Cal by identical scores of 12-5. The Gauchos knew they would have to play well throughout the game if they wanted to beat their opponents the third time around.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We had lost pretty badly to them twice before and felt we didn’t stick to our game plan,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We knew if we play a better game we could hang with them and get the win at home.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did come out strong, scoring on its first possession thanks to a goal by sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild. Later in the first period freshman driver Borislav Jovanovic scored an amazing no-look goal during a power play opportunity, making the score 3-1 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>It was an historic moment during the second period as senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge became just the 13th goalie in MPSF history to have over 700 career saves. His 700th save came on a power play opportunity that Cal failed to capitalize on.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool obviously and an honor,” Whitelegge said. “But it’s still team goals over individual goals for me.”</p>\n<p>Following that, the Gauchos found themselves up 5-2 in the second thanks to a penalty goal by Hauschild. However, momentum shifted quickly once Cal junior defender Farrel South converted on a penalty, reducing the Gauchos’ lead to 5-3.</p>\n<p>The Golden Bear defender sparked his team’s takeover of UCSB’s lead, scoring Cal’s next four goals to hand his team a 7-5 lead in the third period. Still, the Gauchos clawed their way back and managed to tie it 8-8 by the end of the third period.</p>\n<p>Despite a tied score heading into the match’s final period, UCSB’s performance fell victim to a sudden meltdown in the fourth. California scored the final four goals of the game, two by freshman attacker Johnny Hooper, who scored the opening goal of the fourth and the final goal.</p>\n<p>“Maybe I could have subbed more,” Wigo said. “We just weren’t that same team that we were in the first three periods and I thought it was fatigue. We dominated the first part of the game but then allowed easy goals, let them get back in and they just played a lot better in the second half.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos underwhelming fourth period proved to be the reason they lost against a great opponent. The same demise would haunt the Gauchos again in their next MPSF conference game against another formidable foe, the No. 5 Pacific Tigers.</p>\n<p>Unlike Saturday’s game, UCSB did not come out attacking aggressively to its capabilities. The Gauchos only mustered one goal in the first period and quickly found themselves down 2-1. UCSB seemed to be in a funk as it kept passing around the perimeter and forcing distant shots.</p>\n<p>Hauschild tried to break Santa Barbara out of its slump with an amazing deep goal as the shot clock expired. However, Pacific was just too dominant in the first half and ended the second period with a 3-0 run and a 5-2 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s confidence entering the third period looked a lot like the team that was dominating California the game before. Led by Hauschild, Santa Barbara outscored Pacific 4-1 in the third period and tied the score, 6-6. The sophomore attacker scored an impressive two goals and assisted on one with a beautiful pass to junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, who put through the equalizer with just seconds left in the third.</p>\n<p>“We came out a little slow,” Hauschild said. “Pacific plays a full zone; they let us shoot. We were just too timid in the first half. I wanted to prove that we could shoot and shoot out of that zone.”</p>\n<p>However, another scoreless fourth period by UCSB helped Pacific coast to its 9-6 victory. The Tigers scored on their first possession thanks to a beautiful deep goal by sophomore attacker Devon Thumwood and never looked back. Sophomore attacker Blake Hokkanen sealed the victory with a goal late in the game’s ending, just as the shot clock expired.</p>\n<p>The loss was another disappointing outcome for UCSB as fatigue seemed to be the repeat culprit in the team’s downfall. The same team that played well in that third frame completely disappeared in crunch time.</p>\n<p>“We struggled on offense but played well on defense,” Wigo said. “We have to finish out fourth quarters. After one game you never know but after two back-to-back games, we have to take a better look at that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will head out on the road to Malibu, California for the MPSF Southern California tournament. The tournament is to be held on Saturday, Oct. 10  and Sunday, Oct. 11. Times have yet to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Contributing to the offense was attacker Bryn Hudson, who had seven assists and four goals as well.</p>\n<p>Aside from maintaining a tight defense throughout the weekend, the Gauchos also counted on senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw, who had 44 saves in total.

She led the team in steals with a total of 64, and recorded 42 goals during her junior season.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the first game, the Gauchos will take on No.12 Pacific. With an overall record of 1-3, the Tigers are on the hunt for wins.</p>\n<p>One of their key players is freshman attacker Kyra Christmas. The Alberta native kicked off her collegiate career with an outstanding performance at the LouStrong Invitational, scoring 19 goals in her first four games.</p>\n<p>Christmas helped the Canadian U-19 team to third place at the 2014 Pan Am games and was the top scorer at the Worlds Hungary Tournament.</p>\n<p>On Sunday the Gauchos will play against No. 7 Michigan in the afternoon and No.15 SDSU at night.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines finished with an overall 3-2 record in their appearance at the UCSB Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Michigan swept the weekly awards with senior attacker Ali Thomason who received CWPA Player of the Week after tallying 19 goals, two assists, four steals and 17-of-19 sprints won. The Defensive Player of the Week went to senior goalkeeper Julia Campbell, who had 35 saves, and the Rookie of the Week was awarded to freshman defender Kim Johnson who managed to put 12 away.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will wrap up the weekend with No.15 SDSU, who will play its first games of the year in this tournament.</p>\n<p>The reigning back-to-back Golden Coast Conference regular season champions have four returning All-American players, including Caroline Israels.</p>\n<p>The junior utility was named GCC Co-Player of the Year and earned ACWPC Honorable Mention All-American last season. With 61 goals, 53 steals and 18 assists, she finished second in the GCC for goals scored.</p>\n<p>Having played against top-notch competition last weekend gives the Gauchos a bit of an advantage for the upcoming games, especially since two of them have yet to see action this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Hartwick at 3:40 p.m. followed by Pacific at 5:50 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/","id":5012,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5011,5010,5009],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Seniors Lead No. 9 UCSB to Three-Set Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos pull off an easy victory over the Tritons","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62309\" style=\"width: 5484px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1922223981\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62321\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62309\" data-attachment-id=\"62309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/hayden-boehle-passes-a-swing-from-the-outside-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg?fit=5474%2C3653&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5474,3653\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Hayden Boehle passes a swing from the outside.

The win brings UCSB’s record to 15-9, 11-9 in MPSF play with two matches remaining in the schedule. UCSD continued its losing streak and its record is now at 2-24, 0-20 in MPSF matches.</p>\n<p>“We could have played a lot better. They played one of their best matches of the year,” junior setter Jonah Seif said. “They easily could have taken the first game and it showed that you really can’t take any match for granted.

It ended up that the three seniors on the court that led the team to victory with their play Friday night.</p>\n<p>“All of the seniors are vital to the team,” Delson said. “They bring a sense of calm to our team and they lead us younger guys both on and off the court. There isn’t a situation they have been in and those guys have been huge to our team this year.”</p>\n<p>The first game was one that San Diego competed in throughout, and up 17-14, it looked as if they might take the game. Santa Barbara benefitted from a collection of errors by UCSD’s hitters and the Gauchos were able to tie the match at 19-19 on an attacking error from redshirt freshman opposite Tanner Syftestad. From this point on, the Gauchos never went down in the game, and they took the first set 25-23 on a service error by sophomore outside hitter Ian Colbert.</p>\n<p>“We played down to their level in the first set,” redshirt sophomore outside hitter Jacob Delson said. “We had a huddle at the end of the set and talked about forgetting that it was senior night and that we were playing a team that hadn’t won in MPSF all season. We just had to wake up and we did a bit after that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB took the lead at 2-1 in the second game and they didn’t let it up, going on a four-point run to lead 4-1 and running away with the game after that. Nielson was the star of the set with four kills and four digs, and Seif added seven digs on his way to 16 total in the match to lead the team.</p>\n<p>The third game followed the same storyline as UCSB took the lead early and the team never relinquished it. Donohue had six kills in the set, ending the match with 12 kills to lead the team, and Seif added three service aces to bring his total to four in the match. Donohue ended the match with two kills as he and his teammates hope to go on the road and bring home a trophy.</p>\n<p>“Donny played a great match. He was the go-to guy in game one” Seif said. “He, like all of the seniors, definitely really wanted the win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have two matches left this week before MPSF playoffs, taking on No. 3 Pepperdine on Wednesday and No. 15 Stanford on Saturday. They will be hoping that the momentum from the win against San Diego will propel them on a run deep into the playoffs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/","id":5013,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5012,5011,5010],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 11 UCSB Goes 3-1 at Michigan Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_5-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Back-to-back overtime wins highlighted a successful weekend for the Gauchos as they dropped just one game at the Michigan Invitational.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67805\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67805\" data-attachment-id=\"67805\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/no-11-ucsb-goes-3-1-at-michigan-invitational/sophie-trabucco-blocks-an-opponent-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_5-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sophie Trabucco blocks an opponent.

It was junior defender Sophie Trabucco who opened up the scoreboard at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243779\">7:00</span> mark. However, the Hawks quickly responded with three consecutive goals from Katie McKenty, LJ Edwards, and Lauren Brennan.</p>\n<p>Hartwick once again came out strong in the second quarter and went on another 3-1 run putting them in the lead 6-3 with three minutes left in the half. UCSB executed on consecutive possessions shortening the Hawks lead, but the Hawks found the back of the cage in the last second to take them into half time with a two score lead.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was a constant battle for the Gauchos who tied the score in two occasions, only to have Hartwick reclaim their lead shortly after. With little time left on the clock, Santa Barbara turned to senior center Lauren Martin who scored 21 seconds after the Hawks had gained a two-goal lead, and was followed by junior attacker Brenna Thomas on a power play to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s senior attacker Bryn Hudson scored first in overtime, Brittany Tait would give the Hawks another chance by forcing the game into sudden death. This was the first time Santa Barbara had gone into sudden death so far in the season.</p>\n<p>It was Martin who won the sprint to give UCSB the first possession, in which she capitalized with the winning goal after 21 seconds to finish 15-14.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day proved to be just as challenging for the Gauchos who came out on top after another overtime game against Pacific.</p>\n<p>Carrying on the momentum from the first match, Martin scored back-to-back goals to start the game. The Tigers found the back of the net on three occasions to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore reclaimed the lead at the start of the second period, scoring on her own rebound after her shot had gone off the post the first time.</p>\n<p>The Tigers had a comeback in the second quarter. For the first time in the game they took the lead after a penalty shot taken by Rachel Krieger. Pacific was now on top with a two-goal lead by the halftime break.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly came back and tied the game within the first minute of the third period with the help of Thomas who set up senior utility Samantha Murphy and Martin on back-to-back possessions.</p>\n<p>The seesaw battle carried on to the last period, in what looked like the Tigers would pull off the win after scoring with only 38 seconds left. But the Gauchos drew an ejection foul and took advantage on their last possession, with Shore scoring the equalizer with 13 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored first in overtime with Shore assisting Martin, followed by freshman defender Kristen Denney to end the first OT period. The tigers tried to fight back, but their goal from Ellen Tiedmann was retaliated by junior utility Miranda Schrader securing the win for the Gauchos, 13-11.</p>\n<p>Martin finished the day with a total of seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against Pacific making it the second game in the season in which she collects that many. Contributing to the day’s success were Hudson, Schrader, and Thomas with four goals of their own.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos split the final day of the invitational falling to No. 7 Michigan, the top ranked team in the tournament, in a 14-8 loss and another nail biter win over No. 15 San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines scored the first goal of the game, but were answered by Thomas to put UCSB on the board. Although the Gauchos scored once again, they also allowed two goals sending them into the second quarter behind Michigan 4-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored on three occasions in the second quarter, two of them coming from Murphy, but Michigan put away four unanswered goals to stay on top.</p>\n<p>The 11-5 lead by the Wolverines proved to be too much for the Gauchos despite two goals by sophomore utility Camila Schafer and Kreiser. Michigan sealed the deal with three more goals to end the game with a six-point deficit.</p>\n<p>The final game of the weekend resulted in a 9-8 victory over SDSU.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs got on the board first, but their lead only lasted 12 seconds thanks to a hat trick delivered by Murphy. The Gauchos would then go on a 3-0 run, including two from Murphy.
