Senate passed a resolution on Wednesday to preserve El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room, which is used by several different cultural organizations on campus. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution to preserve the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room Wednesday following concerns that the historic building would be demolished in 45 days.</p>\n<p>The 40-year-old building is located behind the UCSB Library and is used as a gathering space for several cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>Senators Lesly Silva and Jesse Velasquez authored the resolution and presented it at Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting. The resolution supports student groups <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/students-told-to-evacuate-el-centro-annex-before-possible-demolition/\" target=\"_blank\">who have pushed to preserve the building</a>, asking that it be recognized as a cultural artifact.</p>\n<p>“El Centro Arnulfo Casillas is an open space that can be used and is used by many groups from every race, religion, gender identity, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, status, and creed,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Campus building official Ed Schmittgen sent a notice to campus architect Marc Fisher on Jan. 9 saying that consultants found the trailer’s integrity was compromised following inspection.</p>\n<p>The report lists insect infestation and dry rot on the building’s floor, rust and corrosion on supporting steel beams and lack of adequate ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor. It concludes that the building’s problems create an unsafe condition in case of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The building was categorized as a “severe” life risk per the UC Seismic Policy, Schmittgen said, and advised that the building be either improved or demolished in 45 days’ time. Administrators suggested that although the trailer would be difficult to preserve due to its 10-year lifespan, the building’s artwork could be relocated.</p>\n<p>Over 50 students gathered in the El Centro annex the following Friday to negotiate other options with campus administration. Among those in attendance were Schmittgen, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Vice Chancellor of Campus Design and Facilities Marc Fisher.</p>\n<p>Students listed several concerns, saying the 45-day evacuation timeline was restrictive, administrators had not maintained the building properly and the University could not remove students’ home-away-from-home.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB received distinction and grant money as a Hispanic Serving Institution in 2016, the A.S. resolution states “the Hispanic and Latinx community has seen little to no return on this money that their communities have been promised.”</p>\n<p>“It is clearly stated that ‘We, the UCSB Associated Students 67th Senate, represent and advocate for the undergraduate student body and strive to effectively address their concerns,’ and there is a clear argument that a large group of students who depend on this space want the 67th Senate to act upon their concerns and support them,” the resolution adds.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the A.S. Senate passed the resolution without objection.</p>\n<p>“At this point this has been an ongoing battle for about 45 years,” Senator Silva said. “The whole goal is to finally end this and make it a permanent space that isn’t being constantly threatened.”</p>\n<p>Students will gather in the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room for another meeting with administration on Friday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/","id":3969,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3968,3967,3966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Position Vacancies the Focus of Wednesday’s Senate Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A.S. Senate is aiming to create a more organized process for filling vacancies.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students (A.S.) Senate discussed the resignations and appointments of four members at Wednesday’s meeting and how the vacancies will call for the creation of a permanent system of reappointments.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Senate experienced numerous vacancies, but still does not have a clear system devised to replace the senators’ positions. The past unorganized process resulted in conflict as the inconsistency prolonged the senator appointments. Bryan Velasquez’s resignation reminds the association of the importance of a clear procedure when appointing new senators.</p>\n<p>Velasquez, a second-year music major, resigned from his position as an on-campus senator during the 10th week of Fall Quarter, and Senate now must fulfill the position. According to Velasquez, his resignation was prompted by “personal reasons,” and he enjoyed working with Senate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of things happened towards the end of the quarter, and I thought it was best to take some time to figure things out,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>He said he would consider running for Senate again in the future, but “[doesn’t] see that happening any time soon.”</p>\n<p>“I would definitely be interested [in joining Senate again],” he said. “They’re all amazing people, and we all work really well together.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year economics major Ashley Selki will organize an ad-hoc committee where current senators will create a process to appoint a new senator to fill Velasquez’s vacancy. The position will then be opened for students to run, and the Senate has five weeks to appoint a new senator.</p>\n<p>EVPLA and fourth-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar encouraged the senators to take their time devising a permanent system as he recalled the vacancies the Senate experienced during his own term last year.</p>\n<p>“I very much encourage you to take your time … make a system, make it good, make it work,” Minoiefar said. “It can affect the whole association.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar warned the Senate against arguing with each other and beginning the appointment process before a proper system is created. He said this would lead to more problems during this appointment and in future cases.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think you’re right, you all need to talk about it in here,” he said. “If you’re not happy with the process before you start, it is going to get a lot worse.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also opened the first meeting of the quarter with the swearing in of second-year political science and communication double major Izabella Kipnis as a new off-campus senator. Kipnis had previously worked with the Senate in the Honoraria Committee, a position that will now be filled by third-year political science major Jordan Goulet.</p>\n<p>Kipnis is currently working on transitioning into the Senate and is beginning to focus on working with I.V. Tenants Union in regards to the rising amount of evictions in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Senator Jasmine Sandhu, third-year biopsychology and sociology double major, was also appointed as the new vice chair of the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/","id":3966,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3965,3964,3963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

id=\"caption-attachment-82266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patrick Galoustian has owned iV Menus, a popular Isla Vista food delivery service, since 2008. <em>McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A superior court judge ruled Thursday iV Menus owner Patrick Galoustian will have his preliminary hearing date setting on June 6 as the prosecution obtains further pre-trial evidence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, 45, was arrested in December on four felony charges, including kidnap to commit robbery or rape, rape of a drugged victim and two counts of oral copulation by use of force or injury. He is being held on combined $1.5 million bail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before his arrest, Galoustian owned and operated iV Menus, a popular Isla Vista-based food delivery service, for nine years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday afternoon, Judge Thomas R. Adams announced his decision to postpone Galoustian’s case to June 6, citing five outstanding requests for discovery by the prosecution. In the legal system, discovery is a method that either party can use to obtain more pre-trial evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll get the actual discovery and be ready to rock and roll by the first weekend of June,” Adams told the courtroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After changing attorneys, Galoustian is now represented by Robert Sanger, who served as co-counsel for pop legend Michael Jackson in 2005 when the late idol was tried for child molestation. Galoustian was previously represented by Mindi Boulet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian is a 2003 UC Santa Barbara alumnus. His preliminary setting hearing has been postponed three times after being originally scheduled on Jan. 11. </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated April 6, 2:33 p.m.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82265\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/discovery-requests-push-iv-menus-owners-rape-hearing-to-june/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82265\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/discovery-requests-push-iv-menus-owners-rape-hearing-to-june/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/discovery-requests-push-iv-menus-owners-rape-hearing-to-june/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/discovery-requests-push-iv-menus-owners-rape-hearing-to-june/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/discovery-requests-push-iv-menus-owners-rape-hearing-to-june/","id":3968,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[3967,3966,3965],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
