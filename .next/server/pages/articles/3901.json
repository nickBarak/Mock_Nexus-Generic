Elementary and Santa Catalina. The crosswalks will include a signal light for drivers and “walking hand” clearance for pedestrians in the 25 mph school zone.</p>\n<p>The new concept replaces one of two existing right-turn lanes onto Storke Road with a “pork chop island,” a raised triangular partition, at the end of a new crosswalk into the Santa Catalina complex.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71833\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"794268775\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71820\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71833\" data-attachment-id=\"71833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/screen-shot-2016-07-07-at-10-04-06-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=898%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-07-07 at 10.04.06 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71833 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=888%2C686\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-07-at-10.04.06-PM.png?resize=768%2C594&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The “pork chop” island, marked (A) will replace the existing second turn lane leading into Storke Road. <em>Courtesy of UCSB</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB will experience a shift in population to the west edge of campus over the next five years, and along with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BICYCLE-CIRCULATION-@-STORKE-EL-COLEGIO-RD.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new bike path </a>that wraps around the San Joaquin apartments, the university has chosen the crosswalk plan to create easy access between the two sides of El Colegio and Storke Roads.</p>\n<p>“It’s a safety issue for students and staff who will be going back and forth between the two areas,” said Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for administration, speaking to an audience of about 60 Isla Vista and Goleta residents at a town hall meeting in I.V. Elementary on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Residents of Isla Vista, however, are concerned that the single turn lane and island will create traffic buildup in the area during rush hour, finals week, move-in and move-out weekends and graduation.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much for them to figure out, and they’re so little,” said the mother of an eight-year-old child who attends the I.V. Elementary. “It’s overwhelming. Just to think about my child crossing all these areas … I don’t think he’ll be able to do this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>One meeting attendee insisted that the current plan furthered “the college interest and not the elementary school interest,” and another suggested that the most logical, long-term solution to benefit the community was a pedestrian bridge.</p>\n<p>“What has happened to those cones [at the intersection] will happen to our children,” said Felipe Garcia, a 20-year resident of I.V. “Every single one of those cones has been hit.”</p>\n<p>According to Derek Rapp, a Stantec engineer who is overseeing the construction, the company considered children when drawing up their plans, and the crosswalk will work to improve an already low statistic of four accidents at the intersection in the past five years.</p>\n<p>If the proposed changes come to fruition, I.V. Elementary will potentially need two more crossing guards, and several students who live at Santa Catalina and San Joaquin will be directed to park at Lot 50, Lot 30 and Lot 38 to decongest the intersection.</p>\n<p>Fisher also said that the university will place a “de-emphasis on cars and a strong emphasis on bicycle and bus circulation” as over 3,000 beds are added to Santa Catalina and San Joaquin housing over the next year.</p>\n<p>The university is paying for construction and design of the new project and Santa Barbara County has the authority to approve all necessary permits. The construction is projected to be complete by the start of the I.V. Elementary school year on Aug. 23.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to get this up and operational for this fall, so it needs to keep moving,” Fisher said. “Personally, I feel this is going to be far safer than the current condition.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71820\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71820\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/","id":3901,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3900,3899,3898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2001-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Compiled from the files of Isla Vista Foot Patrol.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Piss With Glee on the SUV</p>\n<p>At approximately 11:20 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 27, Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers patrolling the 900 block of Pardall Road observed an 18-year-old male urinating on a new Ford Explorer in the Burger King parking lot.</p>\n<p>The suspect attempted to hurry off when he noticed the officers; however, they were able to detain him.

Segev completed the surgery in early March, transplanting a liver and kidney from a deceased HIV-positive donor to two HIV-positive recipients. Although the procedure posed the risk of transplanting a different HIV strain, the surgery was successful for both patients.</p>\n<p>President Barack Obama signed the H.O.P.E. Act into law in November 2013, allowing the use of organs from HIV-positive donors for transplantations and laboratory studies. The initial ban was enacted in the 1980s as a solution to a climate of fear surrounding HIV/A.I.D.S., research has since found HIV-positive donations to be safe for transplant.</p>\n<p>CJ Young, representative from Lois Capps’s office, said Capps is “extremely excited” about the successful surgeries and that research resulting from the H.O.P.E. Act has removed the stigmas surrounding HIV-positive donors.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the stigma around HIV is critically important; that stigma can be a barrier to gaining access to treatment,” Young said. LGBTQ communities were “drastically impacted” by the stigmatization of HIV donors, Young said, and former school nurse Capps used the legislation to help amend the problem.</p>\n<p>During a press conference on Wednesday, Dr. Christine Durand of Johns Hopkins said both transplant patients, who wished to have their identities kept private, are doing “extremely well.” The kidney patient has returned home, and the liver patient is expected to be discharged in a few days.</p>\n<p>“The patient would have remained on the waitlist for years,” said Dr. Durand, describing donor conditions prior to the H.O.P.E.

Within two weeks of the pipe rupture, workers and volunteers found 87 birds, 11 dolphins and 42 sea lions that had died as a result of the oil spill, according to the Bren Hall panel.</p>\n<p>The beaches have since reopened and the oil is all but gone from the shore. However, researchers continue to periodically collect balls of tar for analysis, a process known as tarball fingerprinting.</p>\n<p>“There are some issues with that analysis, because, at this point, a lot of the tarballs are very weathered,” said Jenna Driscoll of Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, a nonprofit organization working to protect and restore the Channel.</p>\n<p>Being able to distinguish whether a tarball originates from the Line 901 spill or if it is simply part of a natural oil slick is an important factor in allowing scientists to determine the extent of the damage and how long the cleanup will last. However, at this point there is no definitive technology that permits researchers to distinguish the exact origin of a particular tarball.</p>\n<p>“Those samples should be used to identify response rather than impact,” Driscoll said. “There does have to be some formal method of closing response efforts. A year out, you no longer need to send people to the beaches to respond to oil coming up on the shore.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Response</strong><br>\nState-designed plans are supposed to account for cleanup operations, but environmental groups say the plans were not adequate for the specific situation.</p>\n<p>After the Refugio spill, there was largely a lack of coordinated response between state and federal agencies, county organizers and local environmental groups, according to Linda Krop, chief counsel at the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We were completely floored with the lack of on-the-ground response,” Krop said. “On the evening of the 19th, not a soul was doing cleanup; the beach was full of oil and every wave was taking oil out to sea.”</p>\n<p>After attending state and federal briefings the morning after the spill, Krop said the state and federal regulations for spill responses were not adequate in addressing the immediate action required in the aftermath of the Refugio spill.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really have a plan in place for when you have a spill that starts onshore and threatens to go offshore,” Krop said. “That’s one of the things we need to work on.”</p>\n<p>Since then, both Santa Barbara County officials and local environmental organizations have worked to implement more substantial plans of action that dictate immediate cleanup efforts to take place in the event of an oil spill.</p>\n<p>“The response is still ongoing through the end of this calendar year. We still have county personnel out on the main impact site, going out and assessing that area for impact,” Robert Troy, deputy director for the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management, said. “We’ve been working diligently for the past few months and will continue to do so.”</p>\n<p><strong>Legal and Economic Repercussions</strong><br>\nEnvironmental legislation is often passed in the wake of some sort of natural or manmade disaster, such as in the case of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill.</p>\n<p>Following the Refugio spill, several local groups worked alongside the county and the state, pushing for both new state and national legislation to more strictly enforce environmental protection.</p>\n<p>“We’ve continued to work tirelessly, even a year after the spill, to move legislation forward and to work with these environmental agencies to improve response efforts as well as education and outreach,” Driscoll said.</p>\n<p>Their efforts led to the passing of state laws SB 295, AB 864 and the Rapid Oil Spill Response Act (SB 414), all of which are meant to create a faster and more effective response to a future oil spill. In addition, the Pipeline Safety Act (HR 5050) was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee at the federal legislative level, which increases the frequency of inline pipeline inspection in ecologically rich areas.</p>\n<p>“As a law firm we were looking at various legal issues,” Krop said. “We looked at the regulations that apply to these pipelines, we learned that the federal regulations for this particular pipeline are much weaker than what we do in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71152\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71152\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/","id":3900,"author":{"id":353,"name":"Kevin Flores"},"related":[3899,3898,3897],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
