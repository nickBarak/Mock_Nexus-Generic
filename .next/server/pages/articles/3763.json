The reporting party said the suspect struck her husband, although there are no visible injuries. The suspect had been drinking and was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail (SBCJ).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Wednesday, law enforcement officials arrived at a party on the corner of Camino Pescadero and Trigo Rd. after hearing reports of a fight. A couple, both UCSB students, had gotten into an argument that led to them throwing their drinks at each other. The suspect, the boyfriend, reportedly struck the victim three times in the chest. While there were no visible injuries on either party, the suspect was arrested for domestic battery and booked into SBCJ</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also on Wednesday, law enforcement officers responded to a student who had fallen off a cliff at the corner of Camino Majorca and Del Playa. The victim, a 20-year-old male UC Santa Barbara student, was found conscious and breathing and was transported to the hospital. The victim survived his injuries. A friend of the victim told deputies the victim has taken LSD for the first time and was acting strangely. The friend said she had struggled to keep the victim from falling from the cliff before he broke away and jumped with his arms out, landing on his chest and head before turning over and lying on the beach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, two subjects were allegedly arguing in the middle of Anisq’Oyo’ Park about a chess match they had played earlier. The two became engaged in a minor physical confrontation, and the suspect smashed the victim’s Bluetooth speaker on the ground. The victim pressed charges for vandalism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also on Saturday, law enforcement responded to a report of a fight on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. Upon their arrival, a suspect had already been detained by other law enforcement. An interview revealed the alleged suspect had been in a fight with the residents of the address and broken in. The suspect, a Santa Barbara City College student, then punched one of the residents, prompting the victims’ roommates to aid him. They then pushed the suspect out of the apartment and called police for assistance. The victim made a citizen’s arrest on the suspect, who was charged with battery and trespassing before being booked into SBCJ.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m., an unknown suspect entered a residence on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. through an open bathroom window and stole three laptops. One of the victims was asleep when the theft occurred. Neighbors in the upstairs unit said two unidentified adult males had knocked on their window at about 9 p.m looking to buy weed. The break-in is still under investigation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

id=\"caption-attachment-67203\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Das Williams</p></div>\n<p>Assemblymember Das Williams introduced Assembly Bill 1564 (AB 1564) on Monday to quicken response 911 emergency call from cellphones by streamlining the dispatch process.</p>\n<p>The bill seeks to route emergency calls from cellphones directly to the appropriate emergency response center. Wireless emergency calls are currently routed to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) or local law enforcement first, which often delays response times by the following emergency response center. AB 1564 aims to create a program that includes the help of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), CHP, the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAPs) and wireless cellphone industries to guarantee people in emergency situations receive responses as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill would have Cal OES conduct a comprehensive review of the cell sectors throughout the state in order to cut down emergency response times. Currently in California, wireless calls to 911 go through a CHP dispatch center, even when the caller isn’t near a freeway.</p>\n<p>“Locally, this means that a call transfer must be made from the CHP dispatch center in either Ventura or San Luis Obispo to a local PSAP (such as County Sheriff or County Fire covering Isla Vista) before a first responder is sent out to the scene,” Williams said in an email. “When it’s a life or death situation, additional seconds count.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Alyssa Sahu said her friend experienced inefficiency in an emergency because of the current system.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends that lives in I.V. once called the police to report a burglary that happened at her house and it took them around an hour to show up,” Sahu said. “I think it’s necessary to make sure this doesn’t always happen.”</p>\n<p>Williams said calls regarding the events of May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista were first answered by CHP dispatch before being transferred to local county first responders.</p>\n<p>“This is inexcusable when these emergency calls can easily be routed right the first time. We can’t afford to wait when lives are on the line as they were that night,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>Williams said this issue is of particular importance to the central coast, because the 101 divides in half, forcing calls to go through an extra transfer step.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the 37th district is not part of the 13 percent of California with call sectors that are optimized to ensure calls be routed directly to the public safety force that responds most often to that area.</p>\n<p>“There are several examples of folks calling 911 in our area from a cell phone, and due to a misunderstanding by an out of town dispatcher, a lag in transfer time, or other mishap, the first responders are sent to the wrong house,” Williams said in an email. “There has even been at least one death in the Santa Barbara area in a situation like this.”</p>\n<p>Williams said “optimizing” call sectors is crucial for the 37th district.</p>\n<p>“Fixing the 911 system is absolutely a major legislative priority for me,” Williams said in an email. “I can’t think of anything more important than protecting the lives of my constituents.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, January 7, 2015 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
