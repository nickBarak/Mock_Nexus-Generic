However, the enthusiasm toward the annual Delirium concert has come to replace this lost spirit of Halloween, and Delirium has become a benchmark of the UCSB legacy. In the words of UCSB undergrad Clare Doyle, “music brings people together, especially big names like YG … it’s cool that UCSB throws concerts like this. Kids really appreciate it.”</p>\n<p>Taking into consideration the length of last year’s entrance line, eager Gauchos began lining up for the concert around 4 p.m., four-and-a-half hours before the concert was due to begin. Heightened security at the entrance initiated a wave of fears about the ticket exchange. However, excitement in anticipation of the performance was nowhere near subdued, and hundreds of anxious undergraduates began clogging the underground pathway leading to the Rec Cen fields.</p>\n<p>Concert attendees trickled timidly into the Thunderdome under a heavy security presence. But once inside, the atmosphere changed; the anticipation for Flatbush Zombies compounding the waves of excited heat produced by the pulsing mass of concertgoers. The stream of entering students diverged into two paths, one seeking relative safety in the partially extended bleachers on either side of the main stage, the other merging straight into the throbbing heart of the concert’s ground floor.</p>\n<p>As the stadium grew increasingly packed and excitement grew exponentially higher, everyone began to wonder when Flatbush was set to perform. A full half-hour passed in waiting for the opening act, yet the evaporating energy of anticipation became displaced, manifesting in the body-heaving fray created by Flatbush’s performance. Interventions by stage security, which were primarily to save raving concertgoers from being trampled, couldn’t dissuade the movement and flow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73689\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"339560544\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73689\" data-attachment-id=\"73689\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/meganmineiro_delirium-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=350%2C467&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,467\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"meganmineiro_delirium-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73689\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?resize=350%2C467\" alt=\"Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The throng excluded no classic Halloween character, but some concertgoers’ costumes were lost in the sweaty haze permeating the dance floor. To one freshman, Marlena, the green spotlights radiating from the stage as well as the smell “made the experience”.</p>\n<p>The Zombies began with some of their more well-known hits, but, ever off the beaten path, refused to stay structured, instead choosing to freestyle while performing on-stage acrobatics. The Zombies’ shirts disappeared at the onset of the show, and Gauchos center-stage received a hearty surprise when one of the trio wormed his way to the stage through the crowd.</p>\n<p>During Flatbush’s peak, two stage-wide mosh pits sprung up at the demand of Flatbush frontman Meechy Darko, who refused to continue performing without a “real mosh pit.” The pit soon devolved into rave-like chaos, with Darko interrupting the performance to address the crowd on numerous occasions. His interludes challenged the Gauchos to reanimate a yearning Halloween spirit and were answered with deafening roars by the pulsating mass of proud and primed UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Before performing their outro, “Palm Trees,” Flatbush halted their performance so that a glassy-eyed and drenched Darko could command UCSB to “forget everything else we said tonight; if we leave you with one message, it’s this: O<em>pen your f***ing minds”.</em></p>\n<p>But the main course was still yet to come, following another half-hour of waiting. YG’s act succeeded Flatbush with a crowd-hyping session by his crew’s DJ. Gauchos were taunted with an instrumental intro that brought on YG’s companion rapper.</p>\n<p>A surge buckled the crowd as 400 stepped onstage after another instrumental intro. YG began his act with performances of classic YG hype hits “Still Brazy,” “Left, Right” and “Toot It and Boot It.” A fiercely responsive SB answered with a new wave of mosh pits and crowd turbulence.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73684\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"99159227\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73684\" data-attachment-id=\"73684\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/img_2142/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img_2142\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73684\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Around the middle of the concert, YG brought his performance to a halt, addressing the SB crowd with “Y’all UCSB, right? Lot of Latinos in SB. I love Latinos.” A brief speech about Latinos spawned an anti-Donald Trump tangent met with great support from YG’s famously anti-Trump fanbase.</p>\n<p>YG attempted to quell a coming rant on the candidate by stating, “I’ll save that for the end of the show… in the meantime, I brought a friend with me.” YG then introduced East Santa Barbara native Sad Boy Loko as his guest rapper. While garnering limited recognition in the crowd, Sad Boy Loko regained the enthusiasm of YG previous performance by joining YG in singing some of the duo’s hits.</p>\n<p>After Sad Boy left, YG resumed the concert with a riled performance of “Bitch, Who Do You Love,” another of his most successful and more recent songs<em>. </em>YG periodically interrupted the performance by addressing the Gaucho audience, asking girls to “speak Ghetto” for him and to perform other tasks in tandem with the concert’s atmosphere. YG also included a crowd-hyping interruption to throw some of his personal merchandise into the audience.

Wang, whom the San Francisco Chronicle called “the most dazzlingly, uncannily gifted pianist in the concert world today,” alongside Kavakos, whose violin talents recently secured him the Léonie Sonning Music Prize, performed pieces by Janácek, Schubert, Debussy and Bartok as part of UCSB’s Arts &amp; Lectures series.</p>\n<p>Wang took to the stage in a resplendent glow, sporting four-inch stilettos and a tight, elegant dress that looked as if it were made of nothing but smoke and gold leaf. She has built up quite the reputation for stylish-yet-risqué outfits that allegedly get under some critics’ skin but simply lead me to think of her as the Rihanna of the concert piano world.  Kavakos, in sharp contrast, emerged solemn and subdued in a button-down and slacks. He would have fit just as well in a Silicon Valley startup office as on the stage, and this contrast foreshadowed the dynamic and complex ways the duo’s musical styles would interact throughout the night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75764\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"37285325\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75763\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75764\" data-attachment-id=\"75764\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/yuja-wang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Yuja Wang\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of PBS&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75764\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of PBS</p></div>\n<p>A violin sonata by Janácek started off the night, the technical difficulty of the piece immediately casting light on both Kavakos’s and Wang’s brute-force musical talent. However, the two seemed a bit tense during the first couple movements, and this rigidity meshed poorly with the already dissonant nature of Janácek’s piece. Luckily, by the third and fourth movements, they had settled into their respective grooves for the sonata’s triumphant yet melancholy climax.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Schubert’s “Fantasie in C Minor” followed, providing a welcome reprieve from the tension of the previous piece. The audience’s hopes soared alongside Kavakos’s nimble bow as he weaved a verdant tapestry of sound and light in the Granada’s expanse. Wang’s nimble fingers supplied the backdrop to the magical expanse, the Middle Earth to Kavakos’s quest for the ring, as it were. Afterward there was a short intermission, at which I overheard one patron remarking that, “this theater is run by a bunch of extortionists, I mean can you believe it, $9 for a glass of unremarkable chardonnay? They’re just playing off of people’s insecurities about talking to strangers at intermissions, like of course we’re going to get a drink, what choice do we have?” The disgruntled man wished to remain anonymous.</p>\n<p>The audience filed back in and the two virtuosos re-emerged, Kavakos unchanged and Wang now draped in a slinky, subdued green evening dress. She must have transmuted some of her visual pizazz into musical zeal, as her performance on Debussy’s “Sonata in G Minor” elicited gasps and murmurs from the audience. As she squeezed every last drop of emotion from the Steinway’s lower register, I was shaken by vibrations in my liver itself. Or maybe another organ close to the liver.</p>\n<p>Kavakos and Wang polished off the night with Bartok’s “Sonata No.1 in C# Minor,” a piece that would no doubt make any but the most accomplished of performers quake in their loafers. This sonic rollercoaster bore some resemblance to the Janácek piece from earlier in the night, but where the former felt constricted and claustrophobic, the duo’s nightcap exploded in a cacophony of unrestrained chaos and energy. Drowsing patrons could be seen jerking upright in their seats at the stab of a minor chord or the wail of Kavakos’s strings. The intensity continued to build and build before releasing itself in ecstatic, frenetic climax leaving both performers and audience awake, gasping and perhaps a little sweaty. At one point, I began to suspect that Yuja Wang doesn’t have hands at all, and instead performs with a pair of motion-blurs on the ends of her arms like electrons whipping around inside valence shells. Although it’s not their first performance on the Arts &amp; Lectures circuit, it’s safe to say that Wang and Kavakos will not soon be forgotten by the Santa Barbara concert scene.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75763\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75763\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/","id":6709,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6708,6707,6706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Grammys Pay Tribute to Past and Present","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=900%2C506&ssl=1","description":"No matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The 2017 Grammy Awards were a glimpse back at legends lost and a look forward to the young artists ready to dominate the music scene in years to come.</p>\n<p>Bruno Mars played Prince’s twin, paying tribute to the king of funk.

Vulnerable, she stopped short after opening with “Fastlove” in her tribute to the esteemed pop icon. She asked to “restart” the song from the top saying, “I can’t mess this up for him.” She shares an emotional connection to Michael because of their mutual London roots. It was quite a night for the pop songstress herself. The powerhouse singer simply dominated, bringing home five Grammys for her third studio album, 25, in the show’s most sought-after categories: Song, Record and Album of the Year. The British songstress performed “Hello” in a geometric red and black dress with an accordion skirt, channeling her classic look with a new twist.  The nostalgia in the room was uncanny, with the singer gushing, “The last time I was here was five years ago, and I was pregnant … I lost a lot of myself being a mother … it seems like I’ve gone full circle.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Throughout her five wins, Adele decided to share her successes with an idol of hers, Beyoncé.</p>\n<p>“I adore you, and I want you to be my mommy,” she exclaimed to Queen Bey. “The Lemonade album was so monumental … We got to see another side of you … We, as artists, adore you … You are our light.” Beyoncé stopped the show with her breathtaking performance centered around her latest studio album, Lemonade. Although she chose to perform less popular tracks, including “Love Drought,” and “Sandcastles,” she successfully won over the crowd. Even while pregnant with twins, she still owned it. Bey’s royalty radiated through her goddess-like costume.</p>\n<p>The messages she instilled in us will stay: “Your mother is a woman, and women like her cannot be contained.” Queen Bey’s performance will go down in Grammys history.</p>\n<p>Although there was no specific tribute dedicated to David Bowie, he won Best Rock Song with “Blackstar,” the title track from his 25th and final studio album, which was released on his 69th birthday.</p>\n<p>Best New Artist recipient Chance the Rapper also took the night by storm.</p>\n<p>“I claim this victory in the name of the Lord,” he exclaimed. “I know that people think independence means you do things by yourself, but independence means freedom.”</p>\n<p>He referenced SoundCloud and “all the independent artists out there” throughout his speech and encouraged the audience to continue in their endeavors, big or small. Chance started as an independent artist himself with his first mixtape, 10 Day, and since then, he has made significant strides in the music world, winning his first Grammy with Coloring Book. His success shows that no matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75760\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"859788678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75756\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75760\" data-attachment-id=\"75760\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,506\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=888%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75760\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85-250x141.jpg?resize=250%2C141\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75760\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of NPR</p></div>\n<p>After taking a break from the public since her father’s death in 2009, Paris Jackson finally made an appearance, presenting The Weeknd and Daft Punk. The trio began with a medley of “Starboy” that led into “I Feel It Coming.” The collaboration gave rise to an unusual yet intriguing set that channeled Hoth from “Star Wars.”</p>\n<p>New York DJ duo Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, also known as the Chainsmokers, rocked the charts this past year. Tracks such as “Don’t Let Me Down,” “Closer” and “Roses” blasted through speakers on repeat, whether at a raging party, the gym or car radios. It’s no wonder that they won their first ever Grammy Award this year alongside Daya. Although Rihanna turned them down to be featured in the Grammy winning single, “Don’t Let Me Down,” they still seemed to reach success in the viral department.</p>\n<p>Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots were definitely not “stressed out” about receiving their award for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” in nothing but their underpants.</p>\n<p>“Josh turned to me … and he said, ‘If we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this,’” Joseph said.</p>\n<p>Ed Sheeran was loving our bodies, and we are loving his Grammy performance right back. Although he was a last-minute addition to the set list, he did not disappoint. Sheeran centered his performance around his latest single, “Shape of You.” He decided to play it casual and performed the song with nothing more than his acoustic guitar. His manner seemed like he was performing for a few of his closest friends, yet millions were watching all over the world. His all-black outfit — including a “HOAX” T-shirt, black jeans and kicks — contributed to the affinity of his performance.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native Katy Perry took the stage with a new and improved look. With short blonde locks that frame her face and a new wardrobe, she surprised the audience as platinum Perry. She really was trapped in her “white picket fence” as she took the stage on a set emulating her opening line to her new hit single, “Chained To The Rhythm.” Perry came barreling out in a white, black-lined pantsuit and John Lennon-esque rose-colored glasses and white sneakers. She walked through blue and white clouds and turned the corner to find Skip Marley, grandson of Jamaican legend Bob Marley. The younger Marley channeled his grandfather’s eclectic reggae sound and wore a white army jacket and pants. Perry topped her performance off with an iconic “We the People” backdrop.</p>\n<p>In a night with no shortage of political statements, Donald Trump was criticized by a number of performers. Neil Portnow, record producer and president of the Recording Academy, took a different approach, calling out to Washington to keep American music alive.</p>\n<p>After quoting John F. Kennedy, he remarked, “The Recording Academy together with the music-makers call on the President and Congress to help keep the music playing by updating music laws, protecting music education and renewing America’s commitment to the arts.” Portnow concluded, “We have a collective responsibility to preserve what binds us and to ensure that the whole world continues to benefit from one of our most unique,  economically and spiritually important assets and exports: American music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/","id":6710,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6709,6708,6707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Postmodern Jukebox Brings Charm to Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage lit up with a flaming, passionate red, and the musicians of Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox (PMJ) took the stage in their first-ever show in Santa Barbara.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As I passed under the brightly blinking marquee lights and entered the Arlington Theatre, it was as if I had gone back in time. The courtyard was bustling, and everywhere I looked couples were decked out in their snazziest vintage attire. Elaborate hats with feathers or lace poked out above the crowd while brightly colored suits and long skirts formed a vibrant sea of fabric. The atmosphere was festive and fun as couples and friends alike took their seats and prepared for a swinging Valentine’s Day throwback experience.</p>\n<p>The stage lit up with a flaming, passionate red, and the musicians of Postmodern Jukebox (PMJ) took the stage in their first ever show in Santa Barbara. The group was formed by Scott Bradlee in 2011 and became a YouTube sensation with jazz and swing covers of famous contemporary songs. After their albums and videos became widespread hits, they began touring with various musicians, singers and dancers while keeping true to the origins of their music.</p>\n<p>During the show, Bradlee told the audience, “A lot of you have followed us from the old days when I was recording videos in my basement … so this was always a grassroots thing.

The arrangement was reminiscent of 1920s New Orleans swing with heavy banjo and a quick beat. Robyn Adele Anderson performed the song with a soaring belt and a sparkling flapper dress to match the time period.</p>\n<p>Dani Armstrong dominated the stage next with a vibrant red dress and unwavering confidence as she sauntered to the microphone. Her rendition of Britney Spears’s “Toxic” was sultry and captivating, with a slow, pounding beat and an intense mixture of loud and soft moments. The red-headed singer hit sky high notes that filled the theatre with a vintage-style vibrato. The slight raspy quality of her voice on the low notes and occasional grinding vocals completed the seductive tone of the song.</p>\n<p>Jose said it best when after Armstrong’s performance, he commented, “Anyone else need a smoke after that?”</p>\n<p>In the style of old fashioned floorshows, Casey Abrams introduced himself with flair by theatrically balancing his guitar on his hand, feigning like he was going to drop it with a wide-eyed expression. At one point, just to ham it up even more, he pulled out a bottle and took a sip, all while maintaining his balance. His dazzling talent did not stop there, however, as his vocal performances exuded fun and spontaneity. His bluesy cover of “Sweet Child O’ Mine” demonstrated his strong, raspy voice, and his interaction with the other musicians kept the audience laughing and cheering. He even engaged in a vocal battle with trombone player James Hall; Abrams scatted a musical phrase and Hall mimicked him with blasts from the trombone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75910\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"983708497\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75909\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75910\" data-attachment-id=\"75910\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/pmj-promo-2-12-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=2048%2C1337&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1337\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"PMJ PROMO 2-12-14\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=888%2C580&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75910\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14-250x163.jpg?resize=250%2C163\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=768%2C501&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=1024%2C669&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Harbison Theater</p></div>\n<p>One musical battle was not enough for this show, however, as tap dancer Anise Aliah faced off against drummer Martin Dillard. The dancer’s vibrant energy shone as she kept her wide smile even through the most complex of steps. This wasn’t enough for Dillard, however, as he stopped the upbeat music and began to copy Aliah’s rhythm with his drumsticks, flipping them in the air and catching them with style. Each performer took turns attempting to best each other with impossibly fast beats. Aliah clearly won the crowd, however, as her fast turns, high kicks and relentless wing steps drove the audience wild with applause.</p>\n<p>The evening was a true homage to the days of variety shows and spectacles of performance with one audience-grabbing, fun-loving segment after another. The musicians, dancers and vocalists captured the essence of classic jazz with spontaneity, smoothness and constant collaboration with their fellow performers. The show was meant for Valentine’s Day, as it demonstrated both the group’s and audience’s love of jazz and the swanky style of earlier times.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/","id":6711,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6710,6709,6708],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
