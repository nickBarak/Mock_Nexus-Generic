At No. 3 doubles, freshman Ben Donovan and senior Jurgen De Jager of Cal Poly beat freshman Teague Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton 8-6.</p>\n<p>“There was definitely a lot of tension on the courts today,” Sultan said. “The fans backed their team and helped them get a good start in the doubles matches, but from there I don’t think the crowd affected our team much.”</p>\n<p>In singles Sultan held his own, playing at No. 1 for the first time in months in Galskov’s absence. He defeated Donovan in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7-2). Following suit were Hamilton, who defeated freshman Corey Pang 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), and freshman Erik Johnsson, who beat De Jager 3-6, 7-6, 3-0 (retired). Hamilton’s win was his 14th of the season, tying him with Galskov for the most singles wins in this dual-match season.</p>\n<p>“Watching Teague and Erik battle for their three-set victories was awesome,” Sultan said. “I think our team fitness showed off in those matches. Teague had a tough match and I was really impressed. And Erik played really well so it was great to see him pull out the victory.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played especially well considering they all had to move up one spot in the lineup to play higher positions against different players than they had initially prepared for. Galskov’s sickness also saw Riminton’s insertion into the singles lineup at No. 6 but he fell to junior Naveen Beasley 6-2, 6-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB now looks towards next weekend’s conference tournament. Entering as the No. 3 seed, the Gauchos play bottom seed UC Riverside on Thursday. The Highlanders are 2-21 overall and 0-5 in conference this season, and the Gauchos defeated UCR 7-0 when they played earlier this season. A win over UC Riverside would set up a rematch against Cal Poly in the second round. Last season, the Gauchos won the conference tournament coming in as the No. 5 seed.</p>\n<p>“I think we are fitter than Cal Poly, and next week at Indian Wells could be a different story in the high heat and in a neutral environment,” Sultan said. “I think we can beat this team if we play them next weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has one week to prepare for the biggest weekend of tennis so far this year. The Gauchos plan to continue working on fitness, defensive play and finishing matches better as they prepare to defend their conference tournament title.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins Big West Tournament play at 9 a.m. Thursday, Apr. 24 at Indian Wells, CA.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/","id":804,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[803,802,801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss","biography":"Not available","articles":[172,174,176,177,187,188,193,195,197,198,212,213,214,216,233,235,412,525,725,748,779,801,804,2029,2038,3286,4901,5013,5026,5042,5063,5064,5068,5069,5101,5102,5103,5106,5124,5125,5126,5137,5141,5142,5143,5144,5145,5146,5147,5148,5149,5150,5183,5185,5186,5187,5190,5191,5310,5315,5318,5319,5320,5321,5322,5323,5338,5339,5341,5346],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Close Regular Season Against Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7536.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7536.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will compete in its final regular season match of the year this weekend against rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Big West title run continues on Saturday for the UCSB men’s tennis team as the Gauchos take on Cal Poly in a battle between conference rivals, which could have a large impact on both teams’ seeding in the upcoming end-of-the-season Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the match with an 8-12 overall record, yet are undefeated in conference play at 3-0.

Galskov and Sultan are 7-2 this season playing together in doubles, and this change in partnerships has seen the Gauchos win the doubles point on many more occasions since the switch in the lineup.</p>\n<p>“Our doubles play has gotten progressively better over the course of the season,” Davis said. “Having our top two guys playing at No. 1 gives us a lot of confidence to win the top doubles match and thus secure the doubles point.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s No. 3 doubles team made up of freshman Teague Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton has also impressed this season, as together, the two lower-classmen have won 10 matches together.</p>\n<p>“I expect Cal Poly to play really hard in doubles,” Davis said. “They play aggressive, and I will be really pleased to get the doubles point this weekend.”</p>\n<p>In singles, Galskov will lead the Gauchos playing at No. 1 with his team-leading 14 dual match victories. Following right behind him will be Sultan, who has won his last two matches and nine overall. Near the bottom of the lineup, the Gauchos can expect a strong performance from Hamilton, playing at No. 5, who has won 14 matches this season.</p>\n<p>“Our team is hungry for victory this weekend,” Davis said. “The guys know what is at stake, and they are looking forward to this important match.”</p>\n<p>Looking at Cal Poly’s lineup, the Mustangs will be led by freshman Ben Donovan at the No. 1 spot. Donovan won the Big West Men’s Tennis Athlete of the Week on Wednesday after enjoying a week where he won two matches, one over freshman Alec Adamson of UC Davis 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, and another against Stanford as he defeated senior Daniel Ho 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p>Following Donovan in the lineup will be senior Marco Comuzzo at the No. 2 position with his eight dual match wins this season and senior Jurgen De Jager and his 10-1 record from the No. 3 position. The team’s top doubles team will consist of Comuzzo and senior Matt Thompson as together they lead the team with eight doubles victories.</p>\n<p>“I expect it to be a circus up at Cal Poly on Saturday,” Davis said. “The hostile environment will be both fun and challenging. I want our guys to get on the court and let the scoreboard do the talking.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will leave Santa Barbara on Friday in order to get some practice on the Cal Poly courts and to mentally prepare for what will surely be a difficult environment to play in against UCSB’s rival school. The match begins at 1 p.m. as the Gauchos hope to silence the crowds with their play on the courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/","id":801,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[800,799,798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes on Reigning League Champs UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team will look to ride the momentum created from its double overtime victory against Northridge Saturday when the team hosts last year’s winner of the Big West tourname...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled-34.jpg?resize=251%2C149\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"149\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The UCSB women’s basketball team will look to ride the momentum created from its double overtime victory against Northridge Saturday when the team hosts last year’s winner of the Big West tournament, UC Davis, tonight.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are 8-9 overall and 3-3 in the Big West, sitting in a tie for fifth place.

The Gauchos’ offense, which has been inconsistent all season, will face Davis’ tenacious trapping defense. UCD currently leads the Big West in turnover margin at +5.39, with opponents throwing the ball away 20.3 times.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to be very extended and aggressive on defense,” senior forward Kelsey Adrian said. “We just need to take care of the ball and not turn the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, they rarely turn the ball over, leading conference with only 14.2 per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re really just looking to remain calm and not [have] any unforced turnovers,” junior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “We want to be there for each other when we are trapped and be in the positions that will allow us to get out of it.”</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt the Aggies defense is impressive, but it comes in second only to UCSB, which thrives on slowing down the tempo, allowing just 50.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>UC Davis hopes to give the top ranked defense a run for its money with its Princeton offense, which features a lot of movement without the ball. Also, expect threes from UC Davis and expect them to fall. The team leads the league in three point shots made per contest, averaging 7.3.</p>\n<p>“We know there’s lots of movement and lots of cutting, so we need to make sure we’re between them and the basket,” Adrian said. “[But we also] have to be out on the shooters and get our hands up.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies are also unique in that they play a four-guard lineup.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that can be a mismatch when we’re trying to play Sweets and Tilleman,” Mitchell said. “Those two know they’re going to be guarding a guard all night long. You can’t go for steals, you can’t reach, and you have to keep them in front of you.”</p>\n<p>However, this gives UCSB the rare opportunity to exploit a height advantage.</p>\n<p>“We don’t usually have height advantages because we’re not a very tall team, so hopefully we’ll really work on our inside outside game, which will be very effective against a really high trapping defense,” Tilleman said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos should be able to get on the boards, too, against an Aggies team that falters at rebounding, grabbing the least amount of defensive rebounds in conference. UCSB features two of the top six rebounders in the Big West in Tilleman and junior forward Sweets Underwood.</p>\n<p>“Every game rebounding is important, but especially if we have a height advantage, we better be rebounding even more than usual,” Tilleman said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43903\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43903\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-26/ucsb-takes-reigning-league-champs-uc-davis/","id":802,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[801,800,799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes Winless in Road Openers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Beginning their season on the road, the UCSB women’s basketball team dropped their first two games 60-55 to Seattle and 65-51 to Portland State. “Obviously it’s disappointing,” senior guard Em...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled-34.jpg?resize=128%2C227\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"227\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Beginning their season on the road, the UCSB women’s basketball team dropped their first two games 60-55 to Seattle and 65-51 to Portland State.</p>\n<p>“Obviously it’s disappointing,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “We’re not content being 0-2, but we’re going to keep fighting and keep improving.

We have to find a better way to start.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers plagued UCSB, as the team committed 18 turnovers, leading to 20 Viking points. Portland also grabbed 17 offensive rebounds which led to 13 second chance points.</p>\n<p>“We got out-rebounded and I think that’s what hurt us,” junior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We gave Portland too many second chances. We struggled to box out their bigs.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ leading scorer, Johnson, struggled offensively, shooting just 2-12 for four points. However, Underwood stepped up to tally 12 points and five rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I can’t expect Emilie to score 20 to 30 points every night,” Mitchell said. “There are going to be times when she needs to run the show, but at the same time other perimeter players will need to step up and carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>In Mitchell’s first official game against Seattle, UCSB trailed by 11 before pulling within three with half a minute remaining. Johnson and sophomore guard Melissa Zornig both had opportunities to tie, but both were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>“We had the shots at the end, but the more important plays are the ones that put us at that point,” Johnson said. “Kelsey hit a big three to cut the lead and they missed some free throws. We were playing from behind, though, so we need to make those plays earlier so that we’re ahead instead.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos failed to find an answer for senior Talisa Rhea, who came up with big shots to keep the Gauchos in check. The 5’11’’ guard finished with 20 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great overall player,” Mitchell said. “It’s not like she’s just a shooter. If we went back we’d play her with a box and one.”</p>\n<p>Johnson also tallied 20 points to lead the Gauchos, and Underwood contributed 14 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets is] playing up to her potential,” Johnson said. “I really enjoy playing alongside her. She’s so aggressive. She can average a double-double this year.”</p>\n<p>The differences in the game for UCSB may have been points in the paint and second chance opportunities, where they were outscored 30-16 and 14-4, respectively. The Redhawks also led the Gauchos in assists with 16-7.</p>\n<p>“The rebounding is very disturbing on my end,” Mitchell said. “We can’t be out-rebounded because we’re oversized.
