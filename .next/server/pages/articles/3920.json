This still accounts for less than half of the lake’s maximum storage: 193,305 acre-feet.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Flood Control District reported that the lake was at 17.9 percent capacity last week and at 7.3 percent capacity on Oct. 1 of last year.</p>\n<p>In light of the six-year statewide drought, the United States Bureau of Reclamation said in October 2015 that the Goleta Water District should “expect no new water from the lake.”</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District declared mandatory water use restrictions in May 2015 when it declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency with plans to reduce water usage by 35 percent across the district.</p>\n<p>This type of emergency is declared when the district’s water supply is 65 to 75 percent what it should normally be at that time of the year.</p>\n<p>Drought conditions may improve with recent rainfall, as Santa Barbara County is among the regions most affected by the recent drought period.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are the only areas still in an extreme drought stage, referred to as D3. The rest of the state is mostly in abnormally dry conditions, D0, with a large portion of Northern California no longer in drought.</p>\n<p>It is possible that Santa Barbara County could be lifted out of D3 range after last week’s rain spells.</p>\n<p>While the rain could offset the county’s drought, it also may cause potential infrastructure problems, as last week’s storm resulted in sinkholes, mudslides and severe flooding.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, deputy director of Water Resources at the Public Works Department in the county, said he is not concerned about the infrastructure at Cachuma Dam but recognized that last week’s intense rain could cause problems for roadways and flood control systems.</p>\n<p>“I have no concern over Cachuma Dam,” Fayram said. “If we get future rainfall of the magnitude of the rain we got just before last weekend, then we do have serious infrastructure concerns in terms of our transportation system, our roadways, our flood control system, [and] in terms of our channels and basins that do tend to be stressed in storms like that.”</p>\n<p>Fayram, whose department works in contracting the water from Lake Cachuma, said last week’s rains greatly contributed to the reservoir’s water supply, which will provide water to the entire south coast including Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“We still don’t know yet how much water actually will be available out of this,” Fayram said.  “There [are] a number of factors that go into it, but clearly this was a welcome shot in the arm, so to speak, of water that we just haven’t seen for the last five years.”</p>\n<p>As for how this rainfall will affect water restrictions in Goleta, KK Holland from the Goleta Water District said she is “cautiously optimistic” given the recent storm activity.</p>\n<p>“The Board is not currently considering additional restrictions,” Holland said in an email.<br>\nFayram said he welcomes the rain and capacity increase, but long-term solutions are necessary to solve the drought problem.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lake that’s at 50 percent capacity and can go back down to the same conditions we were in before,” Fayram said. “I don’t think that even filling the lake completely would solve our water supply issues because we started off with a lake in 2011 completely full, and five years of drought put us into a very dire situation.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

access to inmates’ personal information in the jail computers and databases, such as immigration status.</p>\n<p>While the Lobby Corps began the project last December, the Central Coast Immigration Rights Coalition (CCIRC) has been discussing I.C.E. with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) for the past three years. Bill Brown is the current Sheriff.</p>\n<p>In addition to the UCSB Lobby Corps, Santa Barbara City College, Allan Hancock College and Westmont College have been assisting CCIRC.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson, I.C.E. enforces immigration laws in the county and has a workspace in the county jail with access to inmates’ information.</p>\n<p>Jails, separate from prisons, are holding facilities used to confine people serving sentences for misdemeanors, awaiting trial or sentencing on either felony or misdemeanor charges or confined for civil matters.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. and jails work under the Truth Act, statewide legislation that creates more transparency in interactions between SBSO, I.C.E. and inmates.</p>\n<p>The Truth Act ensures that people in jail are aware of their rights to due process, legal counsel and that records relating to I.C.E. access must be open to the public.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if local law enforcement chooses to notify I.C.E. about an inmate’s release, the person and their attorney or designee must be notified of their release date and time as well.</p>\n<p>While organizations like CCIRC and Lobby Corps hope for an increase in strict enforcement of the Truth Act, they are lobbying to completely remove I.C.E. from prisons.</p>\n<p>Daniel Torres, a second-year history of public policy major and an organizer for Lobby Corps, said SBSO has been open about its “working relationship” with I.C.E., but said the Lobby Corps wants to “sever that connection” between the local jails and I.C.E.</p>\n<p>According to Frank Rodriguez, organizer of the Santa Barbara California Immigrant Policy Center which operates CCIRC, the county supervisors provide the funds and resources to the county jails.</p>\n<p>If CCIRC and the Lobby Corps can convince SBSO to limit I.C.E.’s work in the jails, county supervisors would then have the ability to restrict I.C.E.’s access to the jail’s computers and databases.</p>\n<p>Torres said the Lobby Corps and other organizations plan to work with Santa Barbara County Supervisors, and has already met with Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino to discuss the project.</p>\n<p>Lavagnino said, however, that although he disagrees with some immigration decisions made by the federal government, he believes immigration agents have an important role in county jails.</p>\n<p>“I thought everybody would agree that those that come to this country and have committed serious felonies, I thought everybody would approve of them being returned to their country,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Torres and Rodriguez, if the lobbying efforts are effective, the group could be discussing the next steps of the project with supervisors by March or April.</p>\n<p>Torres said it is important to work with the county supervisors and SBSO to “make sure undocumented stories are heard … and taken into account.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Recognition Program, which ensures that after school programs provide healthy food and drinks for their attendees and include physical activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 169</strong>: Through this bill, Jackson aims to fortify the power of Title IX, a law that students use to protect themselves from sexual discrimination and violence, by making the protections and requirements of Title IX and the role of educational institutions clearer.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 203</strong>: This bill would allow for more development in technology education, including media literacy and internet safety in public schools and would require administrators to review the policies and procedures of these programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 331</strong>: In instances of domestic violence, this bill would add public or private universities and colleges to the definition of “domestic violence victim service organizations,” which would extend the aid that nongovernment organizations receive to support victims of domestic violence</p>\n<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 44</strong>: In response to the damage caused by abandoned oil wells, Jackson hopes this bill would help financially support a coastal hazard and legacy oil and gas wells removal and remediation program.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 212</strong>: This bill aims to extend the definition of “medical waste” to include medical waste generated in households, making such waste applicable to the Medical Waste Management Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 224</strong>: This bill would prevent the lead agencies of the California Environmental Quality Act from directly establishing the conditions of a project that may harm the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 290</strong>: With the acquisition of funds, this bill would help establish rehabilitation centers for injured marine animals and would allow the Department of Fish and Wildlife to work with nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 465:</strong> This bill aims to make changes to how the supervisors of abandoned oil wells report their findings.</p>\n<p><strong>EMPLOYEE RIGHTS</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 62:</strong> Under current law, an employee is able to take up to 12 weeks off to bond with their child, take care for a sick child, parent or spouse and take time off if they are suffering from a serious health issue.
