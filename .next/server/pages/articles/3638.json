The increase will go into effect at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year and is expected to raise $35 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano released a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-board-regents-chair-george-kieffer-and-uc-president-janet-napolitano-gov\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January expressing concerns about receiving less funding than expected from Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget plan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s budget proposal this year proposed only a 3 percent increase in funding allocated to the UC, down from 4 percent in years past. The state government typically increases UC funding to meet the ever-increasing number of enrolled students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been tabling and performing outreach to out of state students on our campus, and we’ve still yet to find anyone with 1,000 extra dollars floating around for next year’s tuition,” Spencer Brandt, UCSB Lobby Corps co-chair, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC admits meeting after meeting that a tuition hike is a band aid solution to a long term problem, caused by 20+ years of gubernatorial and state legislative divestment,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving less state funding than expected, Napolitano said the university is committed to adding an additional 2,000 undergraduate students and 500 graduate students for the fall of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many people who control the higher education committees in the Assembly and the Senate use their platform to score political points against the UC, and President Napolitano,” Brandt said. “Then when we take students to the Capitol to meet with them, they point the finger at the UC. And that’s worked for them for a long time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lobby Corps has a message for those legislators: UCSB students are not stupid,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristin Hsu, the external vice president of statewide affairs, has helped Lobby Corps prepare postcards asking students to “Fund the UC.” The postcards detail students’ demands and concerns and will be delivered to the state legislature at a conference next month, Hsu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What are the UC Regents expecting out of state students to sacrifice to pay for this tuition increase? The answer is physical and mental health, academic success, food and housing security,” Hsu said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, UC students are forced to pay for conflicts and disagreements among UCOP, the UC Regents, and the state legislature that we have no control over. That is an absolute shame,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will vote on an additional 2.7 percent tuition increase for in-state residents in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lobby Corps Internal Director Mayela Morales and other UCSB students attended the public forum of Wednesday’s Regents meeting to protest the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might’ve lost with out-of-state students this time, but we also have the proposed in-state tuition increase coming up in the May Regents meeting,” Morales said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morales said that she plans to lobby representatives in Sacramento to “allocate the sufficient funding to the UC system in order to buy out the tuition hikes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an issue that needs to be targeted through various tactics, but we have to remember that if it has been stopped before, we can do it again,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Now, Title IX will only apply to sexual violence that occurs in university-owned off-campus buildings or “any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution,” such as a fraternity or sorority house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university owns and leases a handful of apartment buildings in Isla Vista, as well as 910 Embarcadero Del Mar, the site of Dublin’s Sports Grill and Precious Slut Tattoo Parlor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that the “vast majority” of gender-based violence cases that C.A.R.E. sees occur in off-campus housing in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really concerned that there’s going to be cases that would have been eligible for Title IX [that] will no longer be eligible for those investigations,” Conway said in a phone interview. “But [I.V. is] just one less area that offenders can be accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, survivors of sexual assault can still report to local law enforcement such as the UC Police Department or the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, or seek counseling from organizations like C.A.R.E., but will not be able to report the incident to the Title IX office if the sexual assault took place in I.V., Conway said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, while university-sanctioned fraternity and sorority houses are officially recognized buildings within Title IX’s scope, the new regulations leave areas like fraternity satellite houses out of the university’s jurisdiction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The new regulations] wouldn’t include those spaces … That’s really dangerous for our community, especially because we have so much off-campus housing that is not owned by the university,” said Alia Reynolds, the director of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said that the jurisdiction restrictions are a “ridiculous standard” that will impact safety in I.V.; the I.V. CSD board </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-15/i-v-csd-condemns-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protested the amendments in a letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> submitted to the Department of Education during the public comment period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you create a policy that requires the university to sort of draw a line around the areas where they have jurisdiction to investigate sexual violence and which areas that they do not, you are, by definition, discouraging survivors from coming forward and using the judicial tools that should be at their disposal to seek justice,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations also narrow the definition of sexual violence as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access” — a definition first established by the 1999 Supreme Court case</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which had not previously been used as Title IX’s definition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, under Obama-era policy, an incident had to be either severe, pervasive or objectively offensive to qualify as sexual harassment; under the new regulations, an incident must be considered all three in order to be under the umbrella of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said that the change from “or” to “and” may seem small, but the language change makes a large difference in what may be considered sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That would essentially mean that the instance [of sexual violence] — because it has to be severe and pervasive and objectively offensive — has to happen more than one time, which is the definition of pervasive. So it excludes a lot of instances of sexual harassment [with] this new definition,” Reynolds explained. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710641/PACAOS-Appendix-E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the UC Title IX policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, first-time occurences of dating violence, stalking and domestic violence are still included in the definition of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, universities will have to choose a universal evidentiary standard for handling sexual assault, either with the preponderance of the evidence standard or with the clear and convincing evidence standard for all cases. Previously, schools could use different standards in different cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preponderance of evidence standard requires that there is a 50.1% chance that the charges are true, while the clear and convincing evidence standard requires a higher threshold of 75.1%, according to Conway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Systemwide Title IX Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding which standard the university will use moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colleges and universities are also no longer required to designate most employees, such as professors or staff, as “mandatory reporters,” meaning they will no longer be required to report an incident of sexual violence to the Title IX office if they are informed of it. Instead, schools must now decide “which of their employees must, may, or must only with a student’s consent, report sexual harassment to the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator,” according to the new regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds believes the change will lower the amount of cases reported but said that in her opinion, this particular addition to the Title IX policy isn’t entirely negative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some individuals disclose an instance of sexual assault to someone that they didn’t realize was a mandated reporter. And then those instances are reported and they wish they hadn’t been,” Reynolds explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But mandatory reporters are essential to connecting students to the C.A.R.E. office, Conway said. She’s worried that this change will erase the work of faculty in connecting students to the services C.A.R.E. offers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because you don’t have to report doesn’t mean it’s not the right thing to do to get that survivor connected with the resources and with an advocate,” Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, colleges can no longer use the single-investigator model — in which an investigator writes a report and concludes the case, but no hearing takes place — to investigate an incident of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under current California law, however, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-california-universities-title-ix-20190215-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities haven’t used the single-investigator model</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since January 2019. Prior to January 2019, hearings of Title IX cases in California were conducted only in the appeal process, by either the complainant or the respondent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations permit live cross-examination of the complainant and the respondent by advisers and lawyers, but prohibits complainants and respondents from questioning each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This marks a significant change from DeVos’ initial proposed policy in November 2018, which did allow for students to cross-examine each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that a downside to the hearing method, rather than the single-investigator method, is that cases will take longer to conclude, which, along with the additional trauma of a cross-examination, could further deter students from reporting. Conway said that while more students are accessing C.A.R.E. accessing than ever, she has already seen fewer C.A.R.E. clients choosing to go through the Title IX investigation process since the 2019 change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since DeVos’ announcement, several groups across the country have already pledged to fight the regulations in court, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-announces-new-rules-on-campus-sexual-assault-offering-more-rights-to-the-accused/2020/05/06/4d950c7c-8fa0-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Washington Post reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At UC Santa Barbara, student organizations have already started. Reynolds said that S.A.S.A. is working with Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit organization for gender justice, and that some S.A.S.A. members are part of a newly formed national coalition against sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to work with them to try to bolster that national coalition so we can fight this on the national level as well as on the state level.” </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/12/2020, 09:21 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that a lower number of students accessing C.A.R.E. resources. This article has been corrected to state that more students are accessing C.A.R.E. resources, but fewer C.A.R.E. clients are choosing to go through Title IX investigation, according to Conway. </i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

With many UCSB students coming from an immigrant background, often with relatives who had never heard of Thanksgiving prior coming to the United States, their Thanksgivings reflect a diverse cultural background.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spoke with students who immigrated or have parents who immigrated to the U.S. to learn how they integrate their families’ traditions with those of the customary Thanksgiving practices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Alejandro Stawsky said when his parents first migrated to the U.S. from Uruguay, they didn’t originally celebrate Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we first came here, they had no idea what Thanksgiving was,” Stawsky said. “I would go to school and then I would come back home and ask, ‘Are we doing Thanksgiving?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stawsky said his family now mixes Thanksgiving traditions with its Jewish background by celebrating a Shabbat dinner, the Jewish Sabbath meal, on the Friday after Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During Shabbat, we incorporate Thanksgiving,” Stawsky said. “We make tortas de papa, bourekas, baba ghanoush and go around the table saying what we’re thankful for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year global studies and political science double major Kajol Raju said her Punjabi family spends Thanksgiving at her grandparents’ house with a meal of traditional Indian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have turkey, and my aunt makes a ham and mashed potatoes, and then my aunts or grandma will make Indian food like curry chicken or tandoori chicken, and we’ll have sweets like gulab jamun.” Raju said. “After, we throw on an Indian movie and dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year anthropology and art history double major Diana Torres Luevanos said for her Mexican family, the phrase “vamos a comer,” which means “let’s eat,” signifies Thanksgiving.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first arrived to the States, I didn’t really celebrate Thanksgiving how everyone did,” Torres Luevanos said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Torres Luevanos said today, though, Thanksgiving is an important family tradition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We now get together every year in our church and have a whole ceremony on giving thanks,” Torres Luevanos said. “Then we eat tamales, arroz, frijoles and a bunch of Mexican food; sometimes my sister even makes fresas con crema, which is strawberries and cream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Armin Mahini said he and his Iranian parents combine typical Thanksgiving dinner with Persian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Typically we have tahdig, which is a crispy rice dish, but there’s also American food,” Mahini said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year biochemistry major Allysa Foot’s mother is Vietnamese and her father is Honduran. Foot said Thanksgiving is her favorite holiday because it is one of the few occasions in which her family can “appreciate the differences” and celebrate the “beauty” behind the different cultures involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My mom’s side of the family will make seafood like crawfish and crab or clams and oysters … and my dad’s side of the family makes tamales or enchiladas,” Foot said. “They truly give thanks this way by being able to come together and embrace one another and their differences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foot said Thanksgiving reminds her of being “enveloped in a blanket.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re enveloped in this total complete warmth, and it’s comforting, and it’s safe and it’s beautiful,” Foot said. “It’s home.

including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive — who are advocating for the elimination of the ACT and SAT in admissions. As the idea gained traction in recent years, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/18/record-number-colleges-drop-satact-admissions-requirement-amid-growing-disenchantment-with-standardized-tests/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities across the country</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have made testing optional or eliminated it altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the proposal, the ACT and SAT would be optional for two years, with testing requirements eliminated completely for two years after that. Starting in 2025, a “modif[ied] or create[d] test that better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values” will be used, according to the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proposed for the May 21 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC is unable to modify or create a new test in time for California freshmen applicants in 2025, Napolitano recommends that the UC suspend its testing requirements for California students altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommendation specifies that the potential elimination of the ACT and SAT after 2025 only applies to in-state students, and that the UC President will work with the Academic Senate to determine an approach for out-of-state and international students from 2025 onwards. Some potential options include having students take the same assessment as California students or continuing to accept their ACT and SAT scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal follows the UC Academic Senate’s </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comprehensive proposal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, which found that current standardized testing procedures may be a factor in the underrepresentation of minority groups at UC schools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force (STTF) laid out the need for a new testing method, it recommended that the UC continue mandatory testing for now, the opposite of Napolitano’s proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF’s report ultimately concluded that the UC uses standardized tests responsibly and appropriately. Academic Council Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani wrote in an April </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4attach2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">letter to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Academic Council disagreed with that assessment from the STTF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents announced in March that Fall 2021 admissions would be </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“test optional”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the coronavirus pandemic, which Napolitano now recommends be continued until 2022. Those who don’t submit a score will not be put at a disadvantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2023 and 2024, Napolitano recommends that UC admissions be “test blind,” where students can still submit a score, but it would be used for purposes other than selection, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under Napolitano’s proposal, in a sixth-month process beginning in summer 2020 and ending in January 2021, the UC will identify or create a new test by consulting with K-12 educators, test experts, the California State University (CSU) and UC faculty to “construct a test better suited for the needs of UC” for fall 2025 applicants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Napolitano’s recommendation concurs with the STTF to eliminate the SAT Writing test, calling it “an unnecessary time and cost burden for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, one potential option noted by Napolitano is the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF, however, recommended to Napolitano in its report that the UC not use the SBAC test, which they said is aligned to a different set of academic standards than the ACT and SAT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critics of the ACT and SAT argue that race and income are indicators of success on the test, and that inequitable access to test prep prevents low-income students and underrepresented minorities from getting high scores. Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">against the UC to eliminate the tests in admissions, calling the tests biased.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocates of the SAT and ACT </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-03/uc-should-keep-sat-and-act-as-admission-requirements-faculty-report-says\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">argue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is the only way to determine a student’s academic success across the state, as grading systems vastly differ from school to school. They also argue that the test is only one of fourteen factors in admissions — weighed less than high school grades — so changing the test would not make a significant impact on a student’s admission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will discuss standardized testing in their board meeting on May 21, where they will look at Napolitano’s proposal and Academic Senate recommendations and vote on a plan for standardized testing moving forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
