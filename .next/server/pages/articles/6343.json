I had some obvious expectations of how my first year would go, perpetuated by the “party school” stereotype. I thought there would be plenty of drinking, plenty of weed and a moderate amount of casual hook-ups. I didn’t expect all of this on my first night, but when in Rome …</p>\n<p>The night seemed to be going pretty normally. My friends and I went to a friend of a friend’s apartment; there was music and booze and boys. I was a happy camper. I was especially happy when one of these boys was actually talking to me. No, he wasn’t just talking to me. He was being nice to me. <em>Nice. </em>Of course, he offered to walk me back to my dorm and we found out we were both staying in FT (Stupid Fuck Towers). At this point, I was having a pretty good time. So when he asked if I wanted to watch “Harry Potter” with him, the only appropriate response in my mind was “Why wouldn’t I?” But let me tell you, Netflix and chill <em>is a trap.</em></p>\n<p>I sort of expected we would end up kissing, and I was cool with it. Our shirts were off and he wasn’t a terrible kisser. I thought it was going to be one of those average make-out sessions that you quickly forget (or try to forget) within a few weeks. Then, oh how sweet, he lays his hand against my neck and tells me I’m pretty. It could have been a scene from a shitty teenage rom-com. Until there was nothing romantic about it anymore. At first I was uncertain if it was really happening, but after about thirty seconds there was no mistaking it. This kid was choking me. Choking me. Tension in his hands and pressure against my trachea. Needless to say, I freaked out. I had one of those damn-it-my-parents-were-right moments. When I inquired of my partner his goal in strangling me, he said he was into BDSM and wanted to try it with me.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you’re anything like me, the only experience you have had with this mysterious sexual culture is a poorly-written “Twilight” fan fiction that took over popular culture this past Valentine’s Day season. Yes, I am referring to the infamous “Fifty Shades of Grey.” I’m sure the book series and subsequent movies have sparked interest in thousands of people. According to the highly credible magazine “Cosmopolitan,” S&amp;M is now making its way into the mainstream. After experiencing a glimpse into this realm firsthand, however, I thought I would look into the subculture a bit more.</p>\n<p>Once I filtered through the porn advertisements and strange google images, I actually found some surprising information. It turns out that BDSM (Bondage &amp; Discipline, Domination &amp; Submission, Sadism &amp; Masochism) has been growing in popularity over the last few decades. In 1953, Alfred Kinsey published “Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.” One of his studies revealed that approximately half of the people who participated had been sexually aroused by having been bitten. A study published in 1999 by the German Institute for Rational Psychology found that 42 percent of women interviewed stated interest in BDSM techniques, while 25 percent were interested in bondage. In 2009, 39 percent of a sample of college-aged men stated they engaged in sadistic behaviors during sex. And most recently, a 2014 study reported that 19 percent of male participants and 10 percent of female participants found sadistic scenarios described in the questionnaire at least “slightly arousing” when asked to rate their sexual appeal.</p>\n<p>However, I also found that this subculture stresses the importance of mutual respect and consent. Consent as an active conversation before and during any sexual activity in which partners discuss their fantasies and boundaries, to be more specific. Basically, you need to ask somebody if any sort of BDSM practice is okay with them before you start to practice with them. Without this conversation, somebody could think that you are trying to suffocate them while “Yer a wizard, Harry” is coming from your laptop. Yeah, we barely got through the first scene of the “Sorcerer’s Stone.” Even the seductive and successful Christian Grey was polite enough to give Anastasia a full orientation session, complete with a signed contract, and took her in a helicopter before touching her in any unconventional way.</p>\n<p>I learned two things from this interesting experience. First, I would highly recommend getting to know any potential partners before you go to their rooms in the middle of the night. And secondly, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is actually not quite as terrible as I previously thought. You guys should give it a chance if you haven’t already.</p>\n<p><em>Jordan Metz reminds you to see if your sexual partner consents to your kinks before getting down, especially if strangulation is your preferred foreplay. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-awkward-wednesday-hump-thursday-edition/","id":6343,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6342,6341,6340],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[5709,5710,5717,6012,6093,6095,6096,6123,6125,6127,6128,6132,6151,6152,6160,6165,6172,6174,6175,6176,6178,6182,6187,6194,6195,6211,6215,6216,6218,6232,6247,6248,6252,6253,6260,6261,6314,6331,6343,6358,6393,6394,6396,6401,6412,6416,6423,6424,6439,6441,6446,6447,6456,6458],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Get It Girl: Helping the 70 Percent Find Their “Oh”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Not screaming euphoric hallelujahs during intercourse, ladies?

And then, yes, some may be blessed with that practiced partner or just a very patient lover who can stroke or lick them to satisfaction. But the rest of us 70 percent-ers (unlucky souls who have to deal with a steep and promising build-up, only to come to the stomach-dropping realization that no, we won’t be getting off tonight) know that once he is done, the whole sex session is done.</p>\n<p>It’d be nice to say that there really shouldn’t be any reason as to why 70 percent of women don’t reach orgasms during their sex-ventures, but that would be a lie. Of course there are reasons, and I’m going to break some down for you:</p>\n<p>1. Girls take much longer to orgasm. Come on, we all know this. Unless the lady pal sports some seriously sensitive sensors, which could, mind you, be both a blessing and a curse, the man must be mentally prepared to spend anywhere from 10 to 30 to 60 minutes on their woman, depending on multiple factors such as the guy’s skill, the girl’s arousability and the level of communication. It’s an investment, yes, but hey, it’s worth it. (Although, I’d like to note that when you please your women, males—and females!—of this planet, they are much more likely to reciprocate your well-spent time and effort. And that could mean many, many things.)</p>\n<p>2. Now I’m not saying this applies to all women, but quite a few of them won’t speak their minds. Maybe it’s due to societal pressure or expectations. Maybe it’s something fostered from the get-go, from 5th grade education on menstrual cycles to 7th grade sex-ed. Guys are more accepted as the Dora Explorers of their sexual preferences and expression of their sexual needs (ironically, I use a female reference). Why is this the case, especially since a lot of men find it hot when their women tell them what to do or take initiative to show how they turn themselves on, and consequently become hard, ready and very much on fire themselves? But that’s exactly the problem.</p>\n<p>3. Here’s why: Many girls are too embarrassed to vocalize their needs, either because a) they don’t want to bruise their man’s ego, b) hell, half of them probably haven’t experimented with themselves enough to know what they like until the guy decides to test it out, and c) you know those grunts and groans and bone-shaking, scream-inducing peaks of passion commonly witnessed in porn, erotica and even romanticized stories from fellow peers? Yeah, they’re usually not accurate. Forget those one-night stands with the fuck-and-flee horndogs; even with regular, well-acquainted lovers, these scenes might still not see the light of day. Nevertheless, girls perceive this to be the norm and, hence, feel scared to admit that they didn’t experience that out-of-this-world sensation. They may feel inadequate; they may think themselves “annoying” and a “sexual hassle” or they may feel “not intense enough.” Regardless, they still aren’t getting that orgasm, and that’s that.</p>\n<p>4. And, frankly, if you just want to cut it down to the blunt and bare: it’s mental, and the girl isn’t feeling it now. By that point, sometimes it’s just too plain fucking awkward for the more soft-spoken, or any-spoken for that matter, to explicitly declare “I put two fingers by the side of my clit and move them like I’m playing a piano trill” or “Can you rub your palm on the top and then curl your middle and ringfingers into a u-shape and sort of press there—no wait, there, ah—I mean, no not like that—wait, ugh, stop.” Right. Maybe not.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are multiple ways to go about this, and I have yet to perfect this deal myself. First, however, foreplay must not be ignored. Watch some steamy videos, engage in long-desired fantasies, talk dirty. Anything that works because, after all, a good portion of sex is mental. Furthermore, angles matter. It is said that two inches is actually enough to take the girl to her heavenly heights due to the fact that most of her nerves are bundled up toward the entrance of the vagina.</p>\n<p>Most often than not, however, the biggest solution to the neglected climax is just forcing yourself to communicate. I hate telling any woman to “man up” because that phrase is atrociously incorrect in more ways than one, but in the figurative sense behind the phrase, yes, toughen up that resolve. Lift up that chin. Life normally won’t hand you gems and jewels in a treasure chest; it just chucks you little poop pellets. Therefore, as is logical, we need to shake off that nervous hesitation and be strong with stating what we want, what we need and what will make us happy.</p>\n<p>So, 70 percent, I challenge you. Maybe that “thirst-quenching, tsunami wave-surging” orgasm won’t come right away, but it’s definitely there, lurking on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>R.

So you text the guy you’ve been seeing and tell him he’s about to get the ride of his life in 15 minutes and to meet you in front of the College of Creative Studies.

You can get away with this, right? Stay quiet, don’t scream and don’t make any sudden movements.

Can I ask them to leave? I can’t just wake them up to have sex, can I? Would it be rude if we just did it with them in the room? I mean, really, are they going to wake up? They were up binge-watching “Stranger Things” ‘til 3 a.m. last night, so they have to be in a coma by now. The clock’s ticking and we need to make a choice, and from the hard-on I feel on my lower back I already know what his decision is. Just like that, we became a Beyoncé and Jay Z song; I was in a dress and he slid my panties to the side and we slowly had the hardest and quietest sex of my life up against my closet door, which was shielding us from the other bunk in case someone woke up. Thankfully my roommates didn’t wake up, but if they had I would have been beyond embarrassed and I probably would have never invited that guy back to my place. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the thrill of having someone(s) in the room was amazing, it wasn’t the right thing to do as a roommate, no matter how sexually frustrated I was. A system needs to be in place with your roommates about what to do when one of you needs to get done thoroughly. Sex is a great stress reliever and college is full of stress. I’ve heard everything from putting a sock or a tie on the door to sending out a group text saying “give me 20 minutes.” The fact is you’re sharing your living space with two other people who have the same needs as you. That’s three times the sexual frustration!</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Thankfully my roommates didn’t wake up, but if they had I would have been beyond embarrassed and I probably would have never invited that guy back to my place.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So if you don’t start off honest and place some boundaries </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it leads to having sex basically in your closet, then you’re going to have a rough first year, and not the good kind of rough, either. My suggestion is to have an open dialogue with your roommates. Sure, talking about sex is awkward and weird, but you know what’s weirder? Walking in on your roommate as she’s giving her boyfriend the best blowjob of his life and he cums in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mouth but is looking at </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because you just walked in on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">them</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (Yes, that really did happen to me, and the worse part is I maintained eye contact until she swallowed and then high-fived him! It was like I was a part of the job, and let’s face it, it’s not called a blowjob for nothing. Good work, team!) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t want to see that. Unless you’re into that stuff (to each their own). What you want in a triple is a place where you can be yourself and live your life without being invaded on or invading other people’s space in the room. So talk about your schedules and see when your roommates have classes so you and your partner don’t always have to do a 15-minute quickie and hope nobody comes home early. Get your roommates’ numbers just in case you do feel the urge while one of them has a gap between classes and may be in the residence hall, because let’s face it, when midterms and finals come, everyone will want to be cumming in some form or another.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Kelsey Pruett believes in your ability to work out your sex schedule, even if you live in a triple.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

My parents’ marriage (and divorce) involved cheating, and lots of it. I was first made aware of my mom’s adultery when I was 12. Finding out this negative and damaging information without a doubt assisted in shaping my views on cheating. I had no sympathy or understanding toward anyone who cheated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I became older and began to enter into my own intimate relationships, I carried with me an intense fear of being betrayed. Sure enough, the first guy I ever went out with cheated within the first couple of weeks of us dating. I couldn’t possibly understand how someone could so easily disrespect and violate another person like this. The answer seemed so simple to me: if you don’t want to be committed to one person, then don’t be in a relationship. To me, there was no excuse for it. Ever. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years my experience with cheating has expanded and evolved. I’ve seen many others do it, go through it and I myself have even played a role in it. Up until recently I still had a pretty similar black-and-white perspective on it. Now, I think the issue might be a little more complex than I had originally thought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get me wrong; I still think cheating is horrible and potentially one of the most psychologically damaging things that can happen to a person. It can lower a person’s self-esteem beyond belief, forcing them to question their own self-worth and value. I’m still a huge proponent of not entering any sort of monogamous or committed relationship until one is sure they are willing to put forth the effort to make it work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am now more understanding when it comes to making a judgment on someone’s infidelity. I no longer feel the need to say “once and a cheater, always a cheater” after hearing about someone’s indiscretions. I don’t think it’s necessarily right to label every person who falters with a giant, red “C.” I’ve realized life is more complicated than that. Relationships are more complicated than that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was younger, I thought for sure love was the only thing you need to make a relationship work. I thought out of all of the factors required, love was by far the most important. Now, I actually think it’s one of the least. Loving people is easy. Falling in love is easy. Relationships, on the other hand, are hard. They require a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice. Above all else, relationships are a choice. You don’t really choose to love someone; you just kind of do it, sometimes even when you don’t want to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re in a relationship, you have to choose to respect that person. You have to choose to go home to them at night. You have to choose to forgo other options, options you might even think are better options. You have to choose them. Not everyone is in the position to make that choice. Some people just really can’t make that commitment, no matter how much they care about you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re one of these people who simply can’t commit, be honest about it. Accept that this is who you are, and don’t lead anyone to believe you’re different. Until you feel like you’re at a place in your life at which you are able to give someone the respect and loyalty they deserve, don’t try it. It only ends with dishonesty and disappointment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, people with commitment issues are not the only ones with the ability to cheat and betray. One of the most influencing factors in cheating is without a doubt alcohol. No matter who the person is, or however loyal they may be, alcohol changes things. It puts you in an altered state of mind in which your thoughts and decisions are no longer coherent or clear. I truly believe anyone can have a slip-up while under the influence of alcohol. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you’re one of these people who simply can’t commit, be honest about it. Accept that this is who you are, and don’t lead anyone to believe you’re different.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anyone can say they’ll do their best to control themselves while intoxicated, but is that really enough? Does that really prove they have a true commitment to you? In my opinion, no. The real effort comes in the form of them choosing to not get so belligerent they put themselves in a situation that might jeopardize the relationship. The real effort comes in the form of maturity, when they choose to limit themselves out of respect for you.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, relationships are all about making choices. If your partner is truly serious about choosing you, they’ll choose to not black out when they’re not with you. They’ll choose to walk away from the bartender who’s flirting with them. They’ll choose not to answer that late-night phone call from their ex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheating is a matter of choice as well, but it’s not just about choosing not to cheat. It’s about choosing to draw boundaries and not cross them. It’s about choosing to be honest with your partner and yourself, no matter how difficult it may be. And most importantly, it’s about choosing to be OK with losing your other options because you’ve found a gain who’s worth the loss.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to be honest with yourself about what kind of love life is right for you. </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/choices-and-cheating/","id":6342,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6341,6340,6339],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
