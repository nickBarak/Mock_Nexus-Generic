The California Public Employment Relations Board has already obtained “sufficient evidence” to call for a “formal complaint” against the UC, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to AFSCME, previously undisclosed documents reveal that the UC, in some instances, allegedly amended contracts in secret after establishing a “contractual relationship” with vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, “UC’s initial 2016 contract with Lyon’s Security at UC Office of the President’s UCPath Center in Riverside required the vendor to pay their contractors UC’s </span><a href=\"https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/fairwage/faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[$15 an hour]</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> minimum wage. UC amended the contract in 2018 to exempt Lyon’s Security from this requirement,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/22/workers-at-some-uc-campuses-say-they-dont-earn-fair-wages/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mercury News reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a UC Los Angeles food service worker — who logged over 106 hours in two weeks — was paid under two names to avoid receiving overtime pay; the employee’s base pay was $10.50 an hour, nearly five dollars below the UC’s minimum wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 2017 California State Auditor’s report that was critical of the UC’s “flawed” and “ignored” policies surrounding outsourcing and competitive bidding, the UC allegedly amended its protocols “to require all University locations to either allow existing contracts to expire after 10 years or submit them to renewed competitive bidding,” the document read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After 10 years, then, if UC wished to contract out work for more time, UC is supposed to put out a Request for Proposals (RFP), notify AFSCME and justify to the Union why it seeks to outsource the work for the additional period of time,” the document continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the complaint alleged that the university instead granted itself “exemptions” from its own amended policies and extended its existing contracts in secret. This allegedly occurred in secret “at least 28 times” from 2009-2019 at UCLA, when the university added an extra 17 “patient care technical titles” to its contract with AMN Healthcare, a healthcare management service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSMCE also alleged that the UC has spent more money on outsourcing — which has increased by “as much as 52% since 2016” — and has poached union employees’ prospects for employment, opting to instead hire lower wage non-contract workers to do the same jobs, according to a separate press release from AFSCME. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In analyses published by State Legislative committees considering reforms to University contracting practices, UC said it spent just over $345 million in 2016 to outsource jobs normally performed by AFSCME 3299 represented UC employees,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In August of 2019, UC notified state legislators that it now spends $523 million on these same services—a growth rate in outsourcing that is roughly three times larger than its direct employment growth for the same jobs,” the press release continued.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contract renewals are on the table, AFSCME said it is the UC’s duty to first determine whether “[the contract] exists to save money solely on the basis of the contractor’s lower wages and benefits, and if so, to bring that work back in house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of approving such contracts, AFSCME said the UC allegedly goes about filling those positions secretly, leaving contract employees in a “contingent” status, which keeps them at arm’s length from the benefits and wages of full-time employment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allegedly occurred at UC San Francisco, where 62 contracted employees working for Allied Barton, a security service, applied for “career positions” at UCSF, according to the document. Only 11 positions were filled despite many Allied Barton employees “applying to open positions two or more times,” the document read. AFSCME alleged this is a result of UCSF’s decision to keep workers retained to a contingent status.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the recent complaints and strike announcement, Andrew Gordon, spokesperson for the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said in an email that the UC finds that “AFSCME leaders have shown little flexibility on their unreasonable wage demands,” even after announcing its sixth strike since negotiations began in spring 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME leader’s contracting claims and continual strike activity are attempts to gain leverage in negotiations. UC’s agreements with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting and no employee can be terminated as a result of a sub-contracting decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fact, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually increased systemwide by double digits over the past five years. The number of service workers has grown 16.8 percent, while the number of patient care workers has jumped 27.9 percent,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to UCOP’s stance, AFSCME finds that the UC’s treatment of its employees warrants a reaction that goes beyond the bargaining table — “the picket lines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is so troubling about UC’s continuing illegal conduct is that it’s becoming even more prevalent,” Kathryn Lybarger, AFSCME president, said. “These complaints detail UC’s continuing systematic and often secretive efforts to replace its own employees with lower wage contractors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Wilder and her husband do not usually eat their own dinner until late in the evening.</p>\n<p>“Some of my greatest challenges are just the everyday chaos and constant motion of always being prepared, whether it be for getting to school [or] work in the morning, or for getting ready for dinner [or] bed in the evening,” she said.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_30435\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit id=20169 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/CBF_ChildrensCenter_4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1830479797\" data-slb-group=\"30428\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30435\" data-attachment-id=\"30435\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/cbf_childrenscenter_4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/CBF_ChildrensCenter_4.jpg?fit=1302%2C1135&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1302,1135\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1290402441\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"CBF_ChildrensCenter_4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/CBF_ChildrensCenter_4.jpg?fit=250%2C218&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/CBF_ChildrensCenter_4.jpg?fit=888%2C774&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/CBF_ChildrensCenter_4-250x217.jpg?resize=250%2C217\" alt=\"\" title=\"CBF_ChildrensCenter_4\" width=\"250\" height=\"217\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-30435\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-30435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A caretaker watches over two boys at the West Campus Children’s Center.</p></div></span>Like Wilder, millions of women across the nation face the challenge of dual careers — staying in the workforce while they maintain a family. However, women at UCSB, especially those seeking tenured positions in the sciences, find that balancing children and a career can be a nearly impossible road to travel.</p>\n<p>Only seven of the top 100 paid employees at UCSB last year were women, and four of them work in the sciences, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. These male-dominated departments traditionally pay the most at UCSB, as they receive the most grants and other funding.</p>\n<p>Many think that women are less involved in these departments due to a lack of interest. But for the past three decades, the United States has made a concerted effort to attract women to the sciences and other competitive fields. Today, women earn over 50 percent of all Ph.D.s, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>However, a 2009 study of the UC system by UC Berkeley and the Center for American Progress showed that women do not often attain academic research positions in STEM and, when they do, are more likely to quit before obtaining tenure.</p>\n<p>Findings showed that family formation accounts for the “largest leaks in the pipeline.” Women in the sciences who are married with children are 35 percent less likely to enter a tenure track job after receiving a Ph.D. than their male counterparts.</p>\n<p>Single women without children are, on average, as successful as married men with children in attaining a tenure track position.</p>\n<p>According to Eileen Boris, feminist studies professor and hull chair, motherhood and the demands of STEM are often incompatible.</p>\n<p>“Women have not been encouraged in these fields,” Boris said. “That’s partially because of the 24/7 kind of workload in which men more often have other household members to pick up the slack.”</p>\n<p>Diane Mackie, a mother and psychology professor, is a testament to the difficulties of balancing a work and home life. UCSB hired Mackie in 1984, the same year she graduated with a M.A. and doctoral degree from Princeton University. Mackie waited until she had tenure and was a full professor before she had her two sons, who are now 11 and 14 years old.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a trade off,” Mackie said. “Instead of being a superstar professor and a supermom, you are sometimes stuck being a ‘good enough’ mom and a ‘good enough’ professor.”</p>\n<p>According to Mackie, aspiring tenure-trackers must establish themselves in their field early on. However, with evidence that fertility issues and diseases such as autism are linked to giving birth at an older age, less women may be willing to delay child bearing in the future.</p>\n<p>Mackie added that even women who are established in their field and have strong support systems at home have difficulties managing their time.</p>\n<p>“Even with the most liberal, equal-minded guy, women still have the babies,” said Mackie. “There is no ‘good’ time for that in a career.”</p>\n<p>Although some overcome the challenge of having families while working as professors and researchers, social norms prevent many females from acting competitively to get the best pay and the best jobs.</p>\n<p>UCSB regularly matches offers that professors get from other institutions. However, if UCSB is not interested in paying the employee more to keep them at the university, the individual has to take the new job. According to Mackie, many women are hesitant to consider moving their family.</p>\n<p>“Men are more likely to put themselves on the market,” she said. “I suspect that women don’t like to play that game as much.”</p>\n<p>Barbara Prezelin is one of the top paid women at UCSB and a 37-year veteran of the Dept. of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology. She said that she has petitioned to receive earned bonuses, but added that many females do not act as aggressively to get higher pay when it is deserved.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_30434\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1299171316\" data-slb-group=\"30428\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30434\" data-attachment-id=\"30434\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/ns4aug10_stemcell-7-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=1302%2C1090&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1302,1090\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1280341838\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"31\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=888%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7-250x209.jpg?resize=250%2C209\" alt=\"\" title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" width=\"250\" height=\"209\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-30434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C857&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?w=1302&amp;ssl=1 1302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-30434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A female scientist transfers cell media in a UCSB lab earlier this year. </p></div></span>“I do think that male colleagues are far more likely to self advocate for accelerations in promotions which leads to higher pay scales and/or go [through] the trouble to look for possible jobs elsewhere in order to leverage for higher retention pay,” Prezelin said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>According to Boris, all women in academia, regardless of what institution they work at, what department they are in or how aggressively they pursue fair pay, are at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t that women are being discriminated against as individuals, it’s the way the structures are set up at this point,” she said. “The structures represent the ideal worker as the unencumbered individual. More men have been unencumbered individuals.”</p>\n<p>However, work cultures at UCSB were markedly worse for women a mere 14 years ago. In 1997, Professor Yolanda Broyles-Gonzales pressed charges against the university after a study showed that UCSB was the ninth worst offender of unequal pay for professors in the nation. Broyles-Gonzalez, who is now a professor at the University of Arizona, eventually settled out of court and became the first woman in history to win a gender pay equity lawsuit against the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The lawsuit has been very important in my life, for many reasons. The outcomes were many,” Broyles-Gonzalez said in an e-mail. “One of the conditions of my settlement was the establishment of a Gender Equity Review at UCSB for women faculty.”</p>\n<p>Since the settlement, administrators UC-wide have tried to reduce gender gaps and ease the strain on working mothers. But has it worked?</p>\n<p>“It’s only been in the past ten years that [work cultures have] changed here in the UC system,” Ricardo Alcaíno, director &amp; title IX officer at the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, said. “That’s because in the last ten years, there has been such a huge number of influx of not only females into academia and doctoral programs but also males that don’t want to give up their entire life. They want to be multi-dimensional, not one-dimensional.”</p>\n<p>UCSB initiated the Breastfeeding Support Program in 2007 with grant money from the Orfalea Foundation. Five private rooms on campus are available where lactating mothers can feed their children or access breast pumps.</p>\n<p>“It’s another way to encourage faculty … to get their child, nurse their child or another one of their spouses can come by with the child, they nurse and be on their way,” Alcaíno said.</p>\n<p>According to Liz Molina, Breastfeeding Support Program organizer and UCSB human resources office manager, approximately 30 women take part in the free service.</p>\n<p>“It is convenient and it’s a lot nicer than the other options where someone is pumping in the bathroom or in their car,” Molina said. “Pumping takes a long time … so you do want privacy.”</p>\n<p>In 1991, the university’s children services expanded into West Campus. Today, the Orfalea Family Children’s Center and Infant and Toddler Center work with more than 200 children ranging from ages three months to five years.</p>\n<p>Leslie Voss, director of UCSB Childhood Care and Education Services, said 55 percent of the parents who bring their children to the centers are faculty and staff. Voss added that the center staff do what they can to help ease the strain on working parents.</p>\n<p>“Their children’s needs always come first and obviously are the top of the list of priorities,” she said. “But the demands of work, whether as a staff member or faculty … is very challenging.”</p>\n<p>According to Voss, the centers cater to the needs of parents by extending hours during exam weeks, providing parent support groups and assisting families during times of crisis.</p>\n<p>Academic climates have also adapted to the needs of working parents. For example, faculty meeting times are no longer scheduled at 4 or 5 p.m., the prime time for picking up children from school. The university also “stops the clock” for those on the track to tenure, allowing individuals to take anywhere up to a year off in order to care for new children or elderly family members.</p>\n<p>However, while Boris said UCSB has certainly made efforts to assist female faculty with children, it simply isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is doing a good job in trying to stop the clock for those dealing with family pregnancy, taking care of newborns and adopting children,” Boris said. “But the work cultures haven’t changed.”</p>\n<p>Mackie added that the work climate has changed for the better in recent years, but that “little things … can make it harder.” She said that UCSB does not offer camps during most holidays and the university’s quarter system does not align well with other school’s calendars.</p>\n<p>“How much easier it would be to have spring break — or even one week of it — align with the kids’ spring break,” Mackie said.</p>\n<p>Wilder said maintaining the current level of child care available for UCSB staff and faculty is imperative. She added that infant care is needed by many more UCSB employees. But, because infant care is high-cost and the university is dealing with a budget crisis, Wilder said infant care probably will not be expanded without a subsidy for the child care center.</p>\n<p>“I really think that if the UC system saw child care as an essential service it provides to its working employees and students, as opposed to operating the child care centers as business models, we could have more confidence in the continued high quality, accessibility and affordability of the care our children receive,” she said.</p>\n<p>However, there is also a more personal side to the story. With her busy schedule, Wilder said having fun and enjoying family time is often lost in everyday endeavors.</p>\n<p>“Another challenge is the emotional question of whether we are doing the right thing, whether we are making the right sacrifice — sacrificing time home with the kids when they are young for working in a job I enjoy in order to make enough money to continue living in Santa Barbara,” she said. “That sometimes can be very stressful to reflect on.”</p>\n<p>Alcaíno said although academia is rooted in male-centric traditions, systematic changes are inevitable with an influx of working mothers and a change in family dynamics.</p>\n<p>“In the next five to ten years, the cultures will start changing by the numbers — sheer numbers,” he said. “There will be a change in the chemistry of the culture.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30428\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30428\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/","id":3528,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3527,3526,3525],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Housing Trap","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The reality of living in Isla Vista is that housing is often imperfect and hard to improve quickly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>*The following article is the second in a series examining topics of interest and concern about housing for tenants, landlords and the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>The reality of living in Isla Vista is that housing is often imperfect and hard to improve quickly.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, no one is the sole culprit.

The town is unruly, expensive and poorly maintained in many respects. In fact, at 62.5 people per acre, I.V. also has one of the highest concentrations of residents in California.</p>\n<p><strong>Students Want What They Want</strong></p>\n<p>“It’s the student’s desire to live in Isla Vista,” Associated Students attorney Robin Unander said. “I don’t care if it is UCSB, SBCC or student-age person; there is a lifestyle here. A certain demographic wants to be near, wants to be a part of it. That’s what drives it.”</p>\n<p>Currently, Isla Vista is populated 96 percent by renters, 45 to 50 percent of whom are students due to I.V.’s proximity to UCSB and SBCC. According to estimates from the UCSB Campus Housing Office and Santa Barbara City College Housing Services, close to 10,000 UCSB students and over 600 SBCC students indicated in Fall 2010 that they lived in I.V., although the total number of students in the area may be as high as 13,000.</p>\n<p>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals — the largest rental housing provider on Del Playa — said Isla Vista exists primarily as a renter’s market because so many students have flocked to the area for decades.</p>\n<p>According to Unander, there are only a few options available to student tenants who find fault with housing options in Isla Vista: they can move out of I.V. or live in university-owned residences, either on- or off-campus.</p>\n<p>“But then you can’t drink, can’t party,” Unander said. “A lot of students in I.V. want to be at least a little bit involved in that scene.”</p>\n<p>Those who stay in I.V., then, Unander said, will often have to struggle with tenuous living arrangements and hefty rent.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have a constitutional right to live wherever we want to live,” Unander said. “There are affordable places to live — you can go inland, Fresno, Bakersfield, etc.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, according to CHO Director Maya Salmon, there is no dearth of living space in I.V. High demand areas and not-so-high-demand areas, however see varied interest from renters.</p>\n<p>SBCC Housing advisor Amy Collins said I.V. can occasionally be less costly than living elswehere if students are willing to endure close quarters.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the rent in I.V. can be cheaper than downtown cause you can have a bunch of people living together, although the quality of the I.V. house may be worse than the downtown property,” Collins said.</p>\n<p><strong>Do Landlords Push the Envelope?</strong></p>\n<p>Not everything is black and white when it comes to legal conflicts between landlords and tenants in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the majority of cases — sometimes due to grey areas of the law, other times due to student irresponsibility, Unander said — landlords are operating within their legal rights. However, some, she said, do truly have “no regard for tenant’s rights,” and take advantage of matters such as security deposit refunds, charges for repairs and student apathy.</p>\n<p>Gelb, who claims he spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on maintenance and upkeep for his rental properties, said some landlords in Isla Vista do the bare minimum to provide for their residents.</p>\n<p>“You’d be surprised how cheap people are,” Gelb said. “I’m not mentioning names, I would just simply state that there are some good ones and also some simply awful ones who aren’t trying to throw a dime into their place. Just like doctors, there are great ones and there are some that should be disbarred from their profession. “</p>\n<p>Some run-down I.V. properties for example, Gelb said, have aluminum window frames close to four decades old.</p>\n<p>“When owners don’t replace those windows, it becomes a real concern for female tenants worried about intruders,” Gelb said.</p>\n<p>But that’s hardly news — complaints about the ‘sketchiness’ of Isla Vista landlords are made regularly by students, often centering on disputes over damages, security deposits, maintenance requests and rent. However, according to Unander only rarely do students turn their frustrations into legal action.</p>\n<p>Unander, who has been assisting students with housing issues since she joined A.S. staff in 2003, said she has only seen about 25 students actually pursue their landlords in small claims court in her seven-plus years here.</p>\n<p>3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr, whose office oversees Isla Vista, said many students express their discontent about Isla Vista housing to her.</p>\n<p>“Of course you have some negatives because so many people are living in small areas,” Farr said, “but one of the real frustrations is that I hear that a lot of Isla Vista housing situations are substandard.”</p>\n<p>Garrett Goto, a fourth-year hydrology major, said he has felt little effort from landlords to ensure a comfortable living situation.</p>\n<p>“I feel that landlords do the bare minimum to keep their properties in living condition,” Goto said in an e-mail. “[They] know that customers will continue to rent in I.V. regardless of how attentive or detailed they are.”</p>\n<p>Still, students are far from the best tenants. According to Unander, the fact that most students only live in I.V. for three to five years reduces their motivation to treat their residences as anything other than temporary, and hence, more disposable. As such, reckless behavior in I.V. often leads to hefty damages occurred against tenants.</p>\n<p>“There’s no ‘pride of ownership’ out here,” Unander said. “Students don’t really think about ‘wow I really want this place to look nice.’”</p>\n<p><strong>Protect Yourself</strong></p>\n<p>According to Gelb, renting in Isla Vista requires responsibility.</p>\n<p>“[When you lease], you’re entering into a contractual agreement with tenants,” Gelb said. “It’s called a relationship — it’s like getting married for one year.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Sauerbrun, a fourth-year computer science major at UCSB, is currently taking former I.V. rental management company Conquest to small claims court over the matter of $1300 in security deposits charges he alleges were billed to him in error. According to him, the best way to ensure safeguards against housing disputes is to only contact landlords via email, and take advantage of tenant’s services such as move-in videotaping.</p>\n<p>“Everyone gets screwed because some kids don’t take their living situations seriously,” Sauerbrun said. “You gotta stay vigilant and have everything on record.”</p>\n<p>Unander said more students should follow Sauerbrun’s example, and stand up for their rights as tenants.</p>\n<p>“That is part of my frustration in helping students doing things — they all get fired up but then there is just apathy,” Unander said. “[The irony is] that about 90 percent of those students who I have dealt with were successful in court or negotiated with their landlord before court.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31965\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31965\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/","id":3529,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3528,3527,3526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Taking a Time Out Santa Barbara Style","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Looking for something to do in Santa Barbara while you're here for College Cup?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>SANTA BARBARA WATER TAXI</strong><br>\n125 Harbor Way, Unit 22<br>\n805-896-6900</p>\n<p>Riding about in an adorable tugboat named Lil Toot is the best way to tour the Santa Barbara coastline and spend some time out on the water.
