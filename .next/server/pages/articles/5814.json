I’ve got that thing down to a science. I don’t even need to be horny to beat off. I’ll do it just because I’m bored and there’s nothing good on TV. For guys, masturbation is a way of life. We need it to function in this world. It’s more essential than drinking water. Watch the director’s cut of “127 Hours” and you’ll see James Franco beating off with his free hand every other scene between sips of precious water. After he cut his arm off, you don’t want to know what he did with that thing. Spoiler alert … the movie should have been called “The Stranger.”</p>\n<p>Boners have a mind of their own. They’re uncontrollable. It can strike a man at any time, like lightning. Except lightning has it easy. It’s in and out of there. FLASH! And it’s gone. Boners, those guys make their appearance and they just stand there. That thing is going to linger like a broken finger … unless you beat it off and send that little guy back to the flaccid existence from which it came from. Just like our good ol’ friend Jesus, that thing will resurrect itself with a Second Coming — in the next 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Beating off does wonders for me. It’s like an Aderall/sanity pill that I can never overdose on. Before I talk to a girl, rub it out. Before I party, rub it out. Before I go to class, I’ll rub it out. Before I wrote this article, I’m not going to lie — I rubbed it out. And as a reward for finishing the article, I’ll most likely rub it out again later.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Masturbation by itself is completely natural and a necessary means to an end of releasing that testosterone and sexual tension. If you don’t masturbate, your body will literally do it for you while you sleep.</p>\n<p>After I masturbate, my logic and reasoning are sharp and centered. Like a born-again Christian, I can see the light. However, not beating off can be more distorting than beer goggles. It’s like having Satan between my legs while he holds my angel hostage in my nut sack. If I don’t masturbate, sanity goes right out the window. I start making compromises and excuses to convince myself of the most ridiculous things: That girl across the room is kinda, actually alright looking or that sending a text message at two in the morning to the girl I met last week on Del Playa Drive is a great idea. Why do you think guys made a “hotness” rating scale and have “standards?” These are sober beacons of truth to hopefully guide the lost, horny individual out of a midnight crisis.</p>\n<p>Holding off on masturbation can turn a man’s sanity into a cross-mojonation of horniness and aggression. Next time you’re out on DP at two in the morning on a weekend, watch for the guys walking alone and you can tell pretty easily who beat off that night and who is trying to fight the entire 6500 block.</p>\n<p>All you females out there who don’t check your midnight oil might as well go to class all quarter, never open your books and take the final. Sure, some of you can fake your way through it or get a pass/no pass, but the ones who do their homework are the ones who get the honors credit.</p>\n<p>In order for a woman to be on her “A” game she has got to know what’s under the hood. The vagina is so fucking complicated as it is. I mean, there’s a lot going on down there with a labia minora and a labia majora and a vulva this and a vulva that. It’s crazy! It can even be accessorized with clit rings. I’m not even kidding, the clit literally has its own built-in designer hoodie. Am I the only one who feels they’re dissecting the pussy like a science experiment?</p>\n<p>God’s most complicated piece of equipment and He can’t even give us a direction’s manual or something to go by. He leaves us in the dark like a scrambled GPS. You know a simple commandment would have been nice! Thou shall not insert thy penis into thy wife’s pussy without sufficient foreplay.</p>\n<p>Fucking girls who masturbate often and those who don’t are night and day in the sack (or wherever inspiration may strike). How can you expect me to know how to get you off if you don’t even know yourself? The ones who do masturbate often know exactly what gets them off, ride on top far better and cum much faster and harder than girls who don’t masturbate.</p>\n<p>So when a guy asks you, “Do you masturbate?” We already know the answer, ladies. Of fucking course you do! We just want to hear you say it so we can go home and beat off to that later. You’re telling me that you have a gaping hole in your body and you’ve never been curious to stick your finger(s), dildos or conspicuously shaped fruits and vegetables up there?! You’re lying behind that queefing little twat of yours. If I had a hole like that, I’d be sticking everything up there. I’d be like Link from the Legend of Zelda just pulling out all sorts of shit like my Orca, class reader, a spare blue book, a 5-hour Energy and of course, some wet naps if there’s room.</p>\n<p>Ladies, I’m on your side here. There’s no shame in masturbation. Be patient and the good things will most certainly cum. I want you to unleash the freak within and find what Alice really did down her rabbit hole. Don’t do it for me. Do it for you. Do it for America. Heck, I’ll do it to you doing it to America, right now — I’m totally serious. I’m writing here to tell you ladies, on this soap box (of K-Y Jelly) that the double standard for masturbation is a thing of the past and hoards of dildos are vibrating their way into the future.</p>\n<p>The Literary Delicatessen is a fourth-year philosophy major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/occasion-beat/","id":5814,"author":{"id":556,"name":"Literary Delicatessen"},"related":[5813,5812,5811],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":556,"name":"Literary Delicatessen","biography":"Not available","articles":[5814],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"‘Black Panther’ Leaps Its Way to the Top","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Ryan Coogler's  \"Black Panther\" is a film rooted in real-life issues that tells one of Marvel's more grounded stories while being set in an unabashedly sci-fi setting.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Panther” follows some recent creative trends on Marvel’s part while forging ahead with new ideas.

Barring Tom Hiddleston’s Loki, Marvel’s villains are either shallow characters or are downright forgettable. Ronan from “Guardians of the Galaxy” just wanted revenge. Killian (Guy Pearce in “Iron Man 3”) also just wanted revenge. As for Malekith, well, not only did I have to look up his name, but I also cannot remember a single thing he said or did in “Thor: The Dark World.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, when you boil it down, Killmonger’s objective is also just revenge. However, it’s revenge rooted in social circumstance. Growing up as a black child in Oakland, Calif. probably isn’t the most pleasant experience, especially after becoming an orphan. Killmonger did not grow up in an affluent, high-tech African nation; he had to struggle in one of America’s most crime-ridden cities and experience prejudice. And I love the fact that the movie doesn’t just say this outright; it’s something that’s heavily implicit. Killmonger’s pain leads him to become the very thing he hates, which makes him a fascinating, complex villain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Jordan can now safely say that he has escaped the stain on his filmography that is “Fantastic Four.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Killmonger’s partner Ulysses Klaue, a villain returning from</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Age of Ultron,” Andy Serkis seems like he’s having a helluva time playing such a hammy role without having to wear a mo-cap suit. But in the grand scheme of things, Klaue is a throwaway villain and the film spares no time in acknowledging this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the rest of the cast could not be considered throwaways, though. Boseman is back in top form as the Black Panther, King of Wakanda, superhero and sovereign ruler.

While she kicks the most ass, she’s also part of some ham-fisted drama between herself and her lover W’Kabi, played by Daniel Kaluuya (We know they’re lovers because she tells us they are). After playing such an interesting protagonist in “Get Out,” it’s a shame to see Kaluuya having to portray such a thinly written character who changes allegiances on a dime. Victim to exposition and some truly goofy scenes with CGI rhinos, he is the film’s greatest writing casualty, mostly existing to serve the plot rather than himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of the CGI, “Black Panther” is heavily reliant on it, for both good and ill. It would be pretty much impossible to depict Wakanda in its purple-tinged sci-fi tech glory otherwise, but then you have the final battle with the aforementioned CGI rhinos and a literal catfight between men in mo-cap suits. At that point it looks less like a battle and more like a violent Robert Zemeckis flick. There’s just something about CGI — when used to depict things you could otherwise depict practically — that kills immersion. You can’t have Black Panther fighting Killmonger on a mag-lev train track, of course, but can’t they at least be in actual suits? It’s the movie’s climax; it deserves the feeling of authenticity that had been fairly consistent up until that point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then again, a fight is only as good as the story behind it. It can be flashy, it can look badass, but if you don’t give a shit what’s happening with the characters then the fight is just that. “Black Panther,” besides being about a king fighting for what’s his, also delves into themes of responsibility. Wakanda has the technology and resources to enhance the lives of millions. But should it? T’Challa grapples with this question throughout the film, which drives his decisions and his interactions with his loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killmonger, however, thinks Wakanda ought to arm people of color to rise up against their oppressors. The film is very much interested in observing how people utilize power, both of the fictional superhuman variety and the political variant. In a world where we have politicians making increasingly stupid decisions all across the bloody planet, it’s certainly not something to quickly dismiss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we have a smart Marvel movie that’s not set in New York for once and has an awesome cast to play fascinating characters, a gorgeously rendered setting and an engrossing story that develops its characters well and leaves me excited to see them in a couple more months when “Infinity War” drops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only reason I could find not to see this movie is having to sit through several trailers for what look like progressively shittier movies. That, or you’re an astounding racist. In which case, sucks to be you.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung apologizes in advance if he offends anyone from Oakland. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/","id":5811,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5810,5809,5808],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Script to Screen: Jordan Peele Discusses ‘Get Out’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/v1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/v1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"To lighten the mood, Peele talked about alternate endings.

The audience experienced “Get Out” in a theater, a place that Peele found refuge in at a young age, with a new understanding as he elaborated on the challenges and triumphs of the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading up to the event, a line wrapped around the Pollock theater as fans mingled and shared their excitement. As they waited in line, students asked for extra tickets in hope of scoring a seat in one of the most highly anticipated events on campus this quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twists and reveals are Peele’s specialty. To disguise his twists, Peele uses the history of film; he takes what we expect and shatters it. Peele creates work with the audience’s reaction in mind. He explained that this mindset stems back to his comedy background in “Key and Peele.” Though he transitioned from comedy to horror, he remains conscious of the audience’s emotions and what they think is going to happen next. Still, Peele stays away from one major twist, instead focusing on a series of escalating reveals. This kept Chris’s actions smart and realistic, while also keeping the film’s rewatchability factor high as audiences would see the hidden motives and hints hidden in the first half of the film.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really nailed it with the casting,” Peele interjected as Ryan asked him how Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), Rose (Allison Williams) and Rod (Lil Rel Howery) were casted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Chris, Kaluuya impressed Peele with his work on the tv series “Black Mirror.” Peele assures the audience that Kaluuya never left his number-one choice for Chris. Kaluuya’s ability to express a full range of emotion was exactly what Peele was looking for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rose, Peele was looking for a naturalistic performer, and while her background in musical theater may seem disconnected from the horror genre, Peele knew that “theater people have a bit of psychopath in them.” In the end, Williams was perfect for both aspects of Rose’s character. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, when it came to Rod, Peele was unsure who he was writing the character for until he met Howery. When Howery auditioned, Peele described it as “imperfect.” It was tough to direct him at first, but once Peele had Howery approach the lines through the lens of his stand-up comedy background, he transformed into the charismatic, funny, witty TSA cop that we see in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sunken place: Peele expands on this idea as he goes into depth of what this place entails. He describes it as a place that encapsulates a feeling worse than death, “the feeling of being trapped in your own body for eternity with no voice.” To further explain his point, he compares it to the feeling that you have when you’re falling in your sleep and you catch yourself as you suddenly wake up. He follows this with a haunting question: “What if you didn’t catch yourself? Where would you end up?” The room fell silent as that metaphor set in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To lighten the mood, Peele talked about alternate endings. There were two endings that were filmed: an ending with Chris going to jail and the ending shown in the film. To our surprise, there was one more. This ending took place in a gated community rather than the ranch seen in the movie. In this scene, we would have seen Chris fighting with some final force as the screen goes black. The next scene reads “3 months later,” and it would have shown Rod breaking into the gated community and, to his surprise, he would see Chris. As Rod calls for Chris, Chris slowly turns and says, “I assure you, I don’t know who you’re talking to.” This ending implies that Chris lost in his last fight for freedom and has undergone the brain transplant surgery. With that said, I am glad it ended the way Peele ultimately chose. However, it is interesting to see where the ending could have gone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Q&amp;A came to a close, Peele disclosed some facts about himself that gave the audience a better understanding of who he is. He explained how when he was a kid, he would go to the movie theater after school, and he described it as his church. One movie that stuck with him was “Edward Scissorhands.” Peele explained that he appreciated the “acute vision” Tim Burton explored as every concept came together perfectly. The fact that the main character was an outcast also intrigued him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Peele continues to make movies, he will introduce themes and ideas that have never been done before. The troupe of the white savior was not represented in this film which is unheard of given that there is at least one in every film in the movie industry. After 23 days of filming and a 4.5 million dollar budget, “Get Out” has become a film that will stand the test of time and will continue to reveal the horror of liberal racism. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80997\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80997\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/","id":5812,"author":{"id":773,"name":"Viv Shields"},"related":[5811,5810,5809],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Big Sick’ Writers Uncover Their Roots at Script to Screen","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23BIGSICK1-master768.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23BIGSICK1-master768.jpg?resize=768%2C450&ssl=1","description":"The Big Sick champions the romantic comedy genre, delivering humor, heart and reality while simultaneously staying true to its roots.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In an early scene in “The Big Sick,” Kumail Nanjiani’s character reveals an embarrassing high school portrait, complete with dramatic swooping bangs and an angst-ridden stare at the camera, both accredited to the character’s adoration of ’90s rom-com legend, Hugh Grant.</p>\n<p>While <em>The Big Sick</em> shares a genre with the traditional romantic comedies that catapulted Grant to fame, the film exists on a completely different emotional and theatrical playing field.

After a screening of “The Big Sick,” the pair, who have been married since 2007, sat down with Pollock Theater director Matthew Ryan to discuss the film’s script. The film has experienced extraordinary financial and critical success, becoming the most successful independent film release of 2017 and amassing countless awards, including an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nanjiani, best known for his starring role in HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” also stars as the film’s lead character, a fictitious version of himself. The character is a stand-up comedian torn between the expectations of his traditional Pakistani family and his love for Emily, an American psychology graduate student played by Zoe Kazan. The plot thickens when Emily ends up in the hospital with a mysterious illness, which results in her being placed in a medically induced coma. Emily’s coma marks the arrival of her parents, played by the legendary Holly Hunter and Ray Romano, who challenge Kumail’s issues of identity and vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The pair revealed that creating the film’s script from their own story was not always an easy process. They first created a “puke draft” which consisted of 164 pages of raw, unstructured story drawn from their personal experiences. Gordon explained that adapting this version of the script would be impossible as it contained too much detail and would not translate well onto screen.</p>\n<p>“Real lives are boring,” she said “It’s the structure which makes a story interesting.”</p>\n<p>Slowly, over the course of three years, the couple edited down the story, creating a solid narrative comprised of what felt relevant to them.</p>\n<p>As they got further along in the writing process, the couple realized that some moments of their own story, which initially seemed important, did not entirely fit into the film. The duo did not mind changing or embellishing the truth, as they were not aiming to create a biopic, but the best story they could possibly tell. Gordon and Nanjiani did, however, try to sneak personal anecdotes into the film, like Kumail’s love of “The X-Files” and Emily’s favorite brain T-shirt, for example.</p>\n<p>Nanjiani noted that it was important to create a flawed when attempting to mirror himself. He explained that oftentimes when individuals are involved with the production of their own stories, the stories morph into vanity projects, portraying themselves as perfect and idealistic.</p>\n<p>“Why would I want to play someone who doesn’t grow by the end of the story?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The writing process also proved to be somewhat introspective. Nanjiani found that writing scenes based on his own family dynamic allowed him to see his parents’ perspective more clearly.</p>\n<p>On crafting characters in general, the pair elaborated that their main goal was for the audience to thoroughly understand all their characters. “</p>\n<p>You’re supposed to understand the character’s viewpoint but not agree with them,” Gordon said. “Nobody’s right, nobody’s wrong. Everyone just has different opinions.”</p>\n<p>This empathetic dogma brings layers of warmth and credibility to the film, as each character is given a sincere viewpoint rooted in genuine emotions.</p>\n<p>Portraying a real relationship was also of high importance to the screenwriters. Gordon explained that while she is a fan of romantic comedies, the relationships depicted in them kind of just fall rigidly into place. People are “more resistant” to love in real relationships. She also found that the female characters of rom-coms often come as an afterthought to their male counterparts.</p>\n<p>“The men decide everything, but they are in a relationship together,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>The couple’s commitment to an authentic script manifests itself in every scene of the hilarious comedy, which had the Pollock consumed in countless uproars of laughter throughout the screening. <em>The Big Sick</em> champions the romantic comedy genre, delivering humor, heart and reality while simultaneously staying true to its roots.</p>\n<p><em>The Big Sick</em> is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-14/big-sick-writers-uncover-their-roots-at-script-to-screen/","id":5813,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[5812,5811,5810],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
