The Food Co-op will also be hosting a demonstration about how to make a gluten-free, vegan ice cream sandwich from 5 to 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>RALLY AGAINST SEXUAL VIOLENCE</strong><br>\nTake Back the Night will be hosting its annual sexual violence awareness rally and march from 4 to 8 p.m. Thursday at Anisq’Oyo’ Park. The rally will feature two guest speakers: Kat Alexander, who founded a website called Report It, Girl where sexual assault survivors share their stories, and Chardonnay Madkins, project manager for the nonprofit End Rape on Campus. Attendees can also partake in spaces for succulent pot decorating, adult coloring books and friendship bracelet making. There will also be free food.</p>\n<p><strong>LOCAL MATTERS MATTER</strong><br>\nThe I.V. Community Services District (CSD) will be hosting a special meeting 6 p.m. Thursday in the I.V. Clinic building. At the meeting, board directors will consider taking a position on Measure O — the proposed tax measure to provide additional funding to I.V. parks — and they will consider taking a position on the proposed county budget. The CSD board regularly holds public meetings every Tuesday night in the I.V. Clinic building.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEN-MIC</strong><br>\nThe UCSB Poets’ Club will be hosting an open-mic night 8 to 9:30 p.m. Thursday at the Coffee Collaborative. Organizers say there will be “hot beverages and even hotter performances,” which includes spoken word and some musical production. The event is open to the community, meaning participants are not required to be registered UCSB students.</p>\n<p><strong>EMPATHY THROUGH ART</strong><br>\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center are working together on an art exhibition for Sexual Assault Awareness Month that will be presented 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday at People’s Park. Award-winning artist Tanya Aguiñiga will provide an interactive workshop where participants will be allowed to contribute to a piece of art that represents increasing community awareness of sexual assault issues. The piece of art will be displayed for a month. This event is free, bilingual and open to the public. Lunch will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>THE WEEKEND STRETCH</strong><br>\nThe I.V. Food Co-op is hosting a “Beach Brunch Yoga” session on Sunday morning, a free yoga class in the park with free brunch afterward. Organizers ask that participants first meet on the I.V. Food Co-op patio at 10:45 a.m. and then walk over to 6575 Seville Rd. Those interested must bring a mat or towel and must sign up online through Yoga Isla Vista’s website, yogaislavista.com under the tab “Schedule.” Free brunch is only for those who participate in the yoga session.</p>\n<p><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday at Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking for Sunday can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tamari Dzotsenidze/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>This growth has been a long time coming. He and his former business partner first approached their lawyer on Dec. 1, 2015; they launched over a month later on Jan. 28, 2016.</p>\n<p>Today, the Treehouse has between 850 and 1,000 customers.</p>\n<p>In the early days, he campaigned on foot with his friends by handing out flyers at fraternities, stapling them to telephone poles and handing out business cards as early as 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>These sacrifices haven’t ceased now that the business has grown. Barrett said his biggest challenge is the loss of his social life and youth. He cites stories of walking out during midterms because he had to answer business calls and driving all night with his friends to pick up product from San Francisco and be back before 10 a.m.</p>\n<p>“People think because I’m in this business I must smoke all the time, but I’ve never smoked less,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett now employs a UCSB senior, a recent graduate and two seasonal out-of-town workers. His former partner bowed out of the business due to parental backlash. However, the two remain on good terms.</p>\n<p>“I do cater to a lot of out-of-town patients, but the bread-and-butter daily routine is mostly from UCSB students,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett operates his company based on the “three Ps”: product, price and promptness. The Treehouse currently has the most five-star ratings in I.V. on Weedmaps, a source of pride for Barrett. He said all of the medicine sold is organic and that he goes out of his way to maintain the best quality.</p>\n<p>This attention to quality sometimes has financial consequences; one time he dropped a significant amount of product, which he then couldn’t sell. Product that dries before it can sell is taken off and slated for personal use rather than being sold to ensure that customers receive quality medicine.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that he doesn’t like the direction recreational marijuana use is going. While he isn’t against the principle, he believes it needs to be better regulated and that sellers need to consider what customers are putting into their bodies.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue facing the business is banking, Barrett said. Because marijuana is still a federally regulated substance, banks do not accept money made off marijuana. Barrett described this as an “annoyance,” citing safety concerns for himself and his staff, difficulties of being a cash-only business and backlash from customers who wish to use credit cards to pay.</p>\n<p>“Stop thinking that we’re drug dealers,” he said. “I work a lot of hours, over 100 a week easily, over 120 … I’m earning it.”</p>\n<p>With regulations constantly changing and Barrett shifting his focus more toward cultivation, the future of the I.V. Treehouse Collective is uncertain.</p>\n<p>“I get asked all the time, ‘Would you sell it, would you sell it?’ and the answer is I don’t want to. It’s like asking if you would sell your child,” he said. “But the way the laws are written they technically say delivery services will be banned.”</p>\n<p>Despite these setbacks, he maintains hope for the future of the Treehouse. Cities like San Jose have started to issue registrations to allow dispensaries to deliver medical marijuana, giving hope that deliveries may not be completely banned.</p>\n<p>Barrett said he has also considered creating a physical storefront, but he was deterred by the amount of capital necessary.</p>\n<p>All profits he is making are going back into the business, particularly his farm. Though he lives comfortably, his lifestyle isn’t extravagant, and he pays his employees well.</p>\n<p>For Barrett personally, once he graduates he plans to leave Santa Barbara behind.</p>\n<p>“Monetarily, it makes a little bit more sense to be going up north,” he said. He plans to increase the cultivation side of the business and eventually use the proceeds to retire by 34 and move into other types of agriculture.</p>\n<p>“I love agriculture. I’ve always wanted to do crops, [but] it’s just expensive and marijuana’s a cash crop,” he said. “It got me into the industry I have always been dreaming of being in … I don’t have the money to buy 50 acres of almonds and start there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

There were incidents that took place, but overall it was a safe event,” Bertrand said. “I think it marks a continual culture change in Isla Vista for a safer Deltopia weekend.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he noticed much more community involvement in trying to keep Deltopia safe, as multiple organizations participated in keeping the atmosphere positive.</p>\n<p>“We’re seeing much more community buy-in than we ever have before in the effort to make it a safe event,” he said. “In all of it [there were] people promoting positivity, people looking out for their neighbors, people connecting those in need with resources and just making sure that Deltopia is the safest event that it can be.”</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, board member of the I.V. CSD, spoke about the community’s feeling toward police, attributing the positive perception this year to the lack of horses. Freeman said the horses can give a negative impression and that fewer police helped improve the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the relationship between safety and entertainment is difficult to manage and he is unsure whether Deltopia has found the appropriate balance yet.</p>\n<p>“Safety is a trade-off, and we need to ask ourselves, ‘What amount of fun do we want to have for what amount of risk?’” Freeman said. “I do not know if Deltopia is at the right balance, but I do know that just trying to shut down parties and shut down events indiscriminately, yes, that will make things safer, but at what point do we simply say no music ever?”</p>\n<p>Police broke up approximately 12 parties because of “safety concerns” and alleged law violations, such as overcrowding, underage drinking and debris being thrown from balconies of residences.</p>\n<p>Hoover said crowds diminished after the noise ordinance was instituted at 6 p.m. and further dispersed after 7 p.m. to attend the university-sponsored concert, The Warm Up. The concert held its third iteration at the Thunderdome on Saturday, with artists Destructo and RL Grime taking the stage.</p>\n<p>University-led initiatives like The Warm Up and the UC Isla Vista (UCIV) program, as well as a county-instated festival ordinance from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., have aimed at minimizing unrest at Deltopia.</p>\n<p>UCIV, an Associated Students (A.S.) Public Safety Commission project, sent approximately 100 volunteers to notify students of the ordinance and other laws that would affect them, as well as hand out condoms, cookies and water, according to the commission’s chair Jenna Pack.</p>\n<p>Pack said she thought this year’s Deltopia was “1000-percent better” than the year before.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot less chaos, a lot less people, a lot less havoc,”  Pack said. “We saw a lot less crime going on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/","id":4423,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4422,4421,4420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: This Week’s Goings-On","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week's Vista Point includes a silent film screening, live music at an Easter Eve show and a body-positive pool party.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>GO GREEN</strong><br>\nEarth Month is in full swing, and the Isla Vista Food Cooperative is celebrating by hosting various activities from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. that are fun for the whole family.
