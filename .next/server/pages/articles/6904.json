Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment truly designed this festival with the attendee in mind. Shuttles that run all day made travel to and from the island a breeze. Two stages situated right across from each other made maneuvering between acts quick and painless. Non-conflicting set times meant that festival-goers could show up just 10 minutes before their favorite artist’s set time and still get front row.</p>\n<p>Oh, and forget dodging elbows to the face and feeling packed like a sardine. The TIMF crowd actually respects personal space and the “first come, first served” rule. Of course, the occasional muscle-teed and snapback-capped gent may have tried to muscle through the crowd. However, TIMF’s infrequency of the aforementioned demographic makes this festival a walk in the park compared to the usual death match Coachella crowds can devolve into.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a San Francisco music festival without some good eats. In fact, Bay Area local Robyn Green said that her family’s goal was to “eat at every food stand here.” That is a noble goal indeed, Mrs. Green. The tea party included paella, chocolate-covered bacon, coca-cola braised pork sandwiches and acai bowls. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this delicious food was at the comedy tent where one could see Lauren Lapkus (“Orange Is the New Black” and “Jurassic World”) performing improv or Jerrod Carmichael (“Neighbors”) doing some standup. Silent Frisco’s Silent Disco party served as the best calorie burner, where hoards of people simultaneously performed interpretive dance. But now, on to the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dressed in Hawaiian shirts and shorts, Viceroy kicked off the festival with a beach party. With the support of electric fiddles, saxophones and bongos, Viceroy remixed quite a few Top 40 tracks. The crowd responded positively.</p>\n<p>Later on, Run the Jewels graced the Bridge stage with an electrifying performance. They ran out to a rendition of Queen’s “We Are the Champions,” and Killer Mike instantly let the crowd know of his intention to “burn the stage to the fucking ground.” And so they did by spewing vocal fire all over the Bridge. As if RtJ needed to win the crowd over even more, the duo sealed the deal when they took a moment to thank Steph Curry for using one of their songs in a commercial and paid their respects to the late, great Mac Dre.</p>\n<p>Cashmere Cat’s soothing sunset performance was the perfect antidote to the RtJ-induced energy. The Norwegian DJ delivered a performance with a perfect balance of dreamlike melodies and euphoric, dancy vibes that set the tone for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most anticipated performance of the weekend was the debut of Big Grams. This surprising pair, consisting of Outkast’s Big Boi and electronic duo Phantogram, was definitely a treasure at Treasure Island, or as Big Boi put it, “We come together like butt cheeks.” Big Boi even gave the crowd a treat by going back to his roots and offering up a sing-along of Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson.”</p>\n<p>At this point in the night, temperatures fell quite low and the biting breeze of the bay began to leave its sting. It was appropriate then that deadmau5 was fashionably late. Twenty minutes later, just the lighting of The Dome was enough to send the audience in a frenzy, and long interludes into favorites like “Ghosts N Stuff” and “The Veldt” sustained them. Pulsing beats combined with hypnotizing visuals transported the crowd into the brilliant mind of Joel Zimmerman for 90 minutes. Deadmau5’s set was much more than a performance; it was an experience.</p>\n<p>Coming off the high that was day one, day two fell a bit flat.</p>\n<p>If day one was a dancer’s paradise, day two was a lazy Sunday afternoon in a coffee shop which, for the most part, fit the lineup. An appearance from Karl the Fog definitely added to the mood as well. As Jose Gonzalez gracefully strummed away on his guitar, attendees meditated, practiced yoga and had picnics on the lawn.</p>\n<p>Father John Misty did what most performers of the day failed to do: offer a heartfelt performance. In between poking fun at the videographers and joking about the necessity of a man bun due to the high winds, Father John Misty belted out songs so beautifully, you had to hold your “honeybear” … or wish you had one.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Deerhunter failed to elicit any emotion from the audience. Lead singer Bradford Cox even commented that “it sounds like a library out there.” However, this comment seemed like more of a dig at his own band since it takes a lot to shut a Bay Area crowd up.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Chvrches picked the pace right back up and unleashed the crowd’s full potential. Even though lead singer Lauren Mayberry apologized for the wind messing with her vocals and giving her “hairballs,” she did not miss a single note. The synth-pop trio’s charm drew one of the biggest crowds of the weekend.</p>\n<p>The National closed out this wonderful festival in style by bringing out Chvrches’ own Mayberry. She joined in on a duet of “I Need My Girl” with Matt Berninger in a live performance even better than the original. Proving that they get better with age, The National delivered a delightful performance and defended their legitimacy as a festival headliner.</p>\n<p>This festival had it all: diversity, spontaneity, you name it. With a little luck, one may even spot a few Jack Sparrows running around. And maybe, just maybe, if you wear a shark costume, deadmau5 will pull you up on stage. Anything is possible at Treasure Island.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Tickets are $10 for adults, $5 for non-UCSB students with ID, and free for UCSB students with ID and children under 12.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Professor Berkowitz about his past musical experiences, his most recent recorded work, and why this particular piece by Beethoven is so challenging.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: You were a student under Rudolf Serkin at the Curtis Institute of Music, how did your experiences impact the way you approach teaching here at UCSB?</p>\n<p><em>Paul Berkowitz:</em> He [Serkin] wanted to impress upon you, and this is something that has definitely stuck with me very strongly, is serving the music. Any way in which someone departed from that by being over fanciful or putting interpretations on top of the music, that was not right. Not having adequate technique to be able to carry out what you set out to do, that was not right. Well, most of us do not have that luxury. So I do not use that for a model for my teaching, but I do try to hold myself to those standards.</p>\n<p>I do have quite a number of talented graduate students, and I try to get them to see to the heart of the music and not put personal things on top of it. That’s something we all do as teenagers, but you want to grow out of that a bit. I’ve probably given them a little more rope than my teacher, I hope I am a bit nicer. I’ve certainly learned patience over the years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> You also have recorded all of the major works of Schubert’s on piano, a project you began in 1984. Your two most recent recordings and all earlier volumes will be re-issued very soon as The Complete Major Piano Works of Schubert. How does it feel to complete this immense project?</p>\n<p><em>PB: </em>You don’t usually get this opportunity, usually they want you to fill a particular hole of some obscure composer who has never been recorded before, but a record company approached me backstage at a concert in London in 1983 and they said, “We’d like to record you, what would you like to record?” I grabbed the opportunity, and I wanted to do the last three Schubert piano sonatas.</p>\n<p>I grew up with Schubert. His sonatas were not part of the standard repertoire. I now feel I was very fortunate to come upon the pieces in books of music sitting on other people’s pianos. I didn’t have clear models for these [sonatas] but it allowed me to develop my own thoughts and feelings about them. As time went on, I went back to doing more of the those, and I think by the late 90s I had finished all of his completed sonatas.</p>\n<p>It always concerned me in the back of my mind that there were other works of Schubert’s I had not done. So I went back to do the impromptus, and then I realized, well, there are only a few more works of Schubert I hadn’t recorded.</p>\n<p>We have to keep renaming this series, now it’ll have to say, speaking very carefully, The Complete Major Piano Works of Schubert. And I think this is it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> DN:</em> At your recital on October 23<sup>rd</sup> you will be playing <em>33 Variations on a Waltz by Diabelli</em>, Op 120. What made you want to take on this difficult task and what can people look forward to?</p>\n<p><em>PB</em>: Beethoven is a very great composer. We’re always in the shadow of those who came before us. There is something very unique about Beethoven that you don’t get very often. These surprises and shocks that he puts in [his work]. With any other composer you can pretty much guess whether it is to be loud or soft, never with Beethoven. It’s not entirely to be shocking, it’s really in service of a greater whole.</p>\n<p>It’s always a bit daunting taking on Beethoven, and I’ve never done this. Partly because it’s such a huge work and a very large undertaking, partly because its very difficult to get familiar with it. I have only heard it performed live twice in my life.</p>\n<p>Aside from a few variations, it’s actually a very joyful piece and it has a great sense of humor. A few of them are actually funny. There’s a wealth of energy that we sort of forgot its there. Well, it shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>I do feel that it can be a little bit daunting for the audience because there’s no repetition between variations like in the big sonata pieces. It’s never familiar. It’s the most adventurous piece Beethoven, or just about anybody, has ever written, I think. Most of the variations are wildly contrasting, and he starts going very far afield with the different harmonies.</p>\n<p>It is such a large-scale work, almost an hour. People have played a first half, taken an intermission and then played the second half. I thought, that might be too much on an audience, why not just present the work itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> Do you have any words of wisdom for somebody who would like a career in music like yours?</p>\n<p><em>PB:</em> It’s very hard. There are lots of talented people around, and even those who devote themselves fully to the music and are very deserving, there’s very few opportunities. There’s so much luck and good fortune as well as accomplishment involved.</p>\n<p>But if you can’t imagine doing anything else, if you feel like you have to do it, well those are the people that should be doing it. Even then, you have to be realistic.</p>\n<p>There’s no point being blind and saying, “Just follow your desires,” because you have to be ready for disappointment. But if you hold steady, and are very devoted you should get some opportunity along the way.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65568\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65568\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/interview-with-classical-pianist-and-ucsb-professor-paul-berkowitz/","id":6901,"author":{"id":731,"name":"Jordan Metz"},"related":[6900,6899,6898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Goldenvoice To Bring Sufjan Stevens to the Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sujanstevendsdn102115.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sujanstevendsdn102115.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Oct. 24 The Arlington Theatre in Downtown Santa Barbara will be welcoming Sufjan Stevens to its illustrious stage.

With its plush, red velvet seats and elaborate décor transporting you to the nighttime plaza of a Spanish village, the Arlington makes the perfect venue for a show as cinematic as Stevens’.</p>\n<p>A virtuoso since a young age, Stevens can pick at a banjo, lay down tunes on a xylophone or drum set and play a wide variety of other instruments. But the Stevens seen playing live is always stationary with his trusty guitar, which he treats like an extension of his soul. It doesn’t end just there — Stevens is not your average, run-of-the-mill acoustic performer. He’s also a visionary. When attending a Sufjan Stevens concert, be prepared for a dreamy light show, Stevens himself donning a pair of wings and perhaps an endearingly kitschy costume, and an instrumental ensemble of 20, give or take.</p>\n<p>When he’s up on that stage with his adorably awkward demeanor and witty monologues, don’t let Stevens’ boyish facial features fool you — he has been a part of the indie folk music scene since his first album, <em>A Sun Came</em>, dropped in 2000. However, it was not until five years later when the Detroit, MI native garnered some well-deserved attention with his album <em>Illinois</em>, a tribute to what he believes is “the center of gravity” for the Midwest. The album, his fifth, soared to No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. NPR, Pitchfork and Amazon also named it their album of the year. His first hit single, “Chicago,” is included on the track list and Stevens continues to perform it at every concert.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since then, the artist has collaborated with The National and even accompanied them on stage to sing backing vocals on “The Late Show with David Letterman.” Under his record company Asthmatic Kitty, which he runs with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, Stevens has worked with many other blossoming artists in the indie pop/rock/hip hop landscape. And, of course, Stevens has been churning out some new records of his own, too: most notably his latest release in March, <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell.</em></p>\n<p><em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em> paints a picture of Stevens’ struggle to get through his mother’s death. The album makes apparent their stressed relationship; his biological mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and was afflicted with substance abuse issues. In one of his songs on <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em>, he sings, “when I was three, three maybe four, she left us at that video store.” It’s intimate. It’s (extremely) emotional. It’s a different Sufjan Stevens from the one that wears wings on stage. But this is what makes his latest album so great — you feel like he’s singing you his diary with his worldly yet oh-so-gentle voice. Essentially, this deep connection with the audience — this gripping vulnerability that he allows on stage — is what will make this performance a shame to miss.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OkX_r032PM</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

400;\">Regardless of how you feel about TikTok, there’s no denying that it has had a significant role in reshaping the music industry. For those who aren’t aware of what TikTok is, it’s a social media platform that allows users to create short videos set to music. These songs can be used in different popular trends like dances, POV (Point of View) or comedy-skit videos. Everyone on TikTok is given an equal opportunity to go viral and appear on other users’ feeds, which TikTok calls the “For You” page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With TikTok touting around 800 million active users, it is an attractive application for rising artists who are trying to share their music in hopes of it becoming part of a viral trend. The virality of a song on TikTok transcends the application itself, and it oftentimes translates into the song climbing the top music charts and getting millions of plays on music streaming platforms. Some popular examples of this include “ROXANNE” by Arizona Zervas, “Yellow Hearts” by Ant Saunders and “prom dress” by mxmtoon, just to name a few. All genres of music have their fair share of viral songs on TikTok, but here is a list of some good indie songs that TikTok has popularized:</span></p>\n<p><b>“Can I Call You Tonight?” by Dayglow </b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though “Can I Call You Tonight?” was released in 2018, it came into the TikTok sphere around late 2019. It is a soft indie pop song, mainly used to make POV videos and montages. The song has a somewhat nostalgic feeling to it and would be a perfect listen for any mood.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hh1WeQxfCX0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“New Flesh” by Current Joys </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The peak of this song’s popularity was in the summer of 2019, although it came out over seven years ago. “New Flesh” has a very old-timey characteristic which a lot of users capitalized on with their 1950s POV videos. I would go so far as to even say that it was “New Flesh” that popularized the usage of songs in POV videos in general.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaNnztBVD7w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Chinese New Year” by SALES </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Chinese New Year” is a very interesting song in that the lyrics are very melancholic, but the upbeat melody of the song contrasts the lyrics; one might never guess that it is about a breakup. This 2014 song from SALES rose in popularity on TikTok in the beginning of 2019, featuring in videos where users would try to run to a bizarre spot right before the chorus started and dance. In one particularly impressive video, a user zoomed into the Hollywood sign from a very far distance to reveal another person dancing to the music.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gykWYPrArbY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Tungs” by The Frights </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although The Frights are more of a punk/surf rock band, their song “Tungs” has some indie elements to it. “Tungs” is a cutesy song about chasing a crush, and it gained traction on TikTok around October of 2019. The catchiest lines in the song, “Do you like my style? Have you seen my shoes?/‘Cause they’ve been ripped to shit from walking the world for you,” are featured in videos where users show off their unique outfits.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bn3ZUKqXW5I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>“Homage” by Mild High Club </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Homage” blew up right around the start of 2020 in February. Its chord progressions are beautiful, but the song itself states that “Someone wrote this song before,” referring to the fact that the progressions are an homage to Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the most famous composers of the Baroque era. Mild High Club masterfully blends different sounds together to create a very dreamlike piece, reminiscent of the feeling of being stuck in a memory. This song lends itself to a variety of videos, from POVs, to “aesthetic” montages and even to beauty and skin-care videos. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvRBv1NSOtQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few more honorable mentions: “I Can’t Handle Change” by Roar, “Buttercup” by Jack Stauber, “Are You Bored Yet?” by Wallows feat. Clairo, “Swing Lynn” by Harmless, “we fell in love in october” by girl in red and “Marlboro Nights” by Lonely God.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This list can go on and on, but I’ll just stop it here. Usually, it’s very difficult for indie artists to expose their music to a wide range of people and, as a result, indie music is typically seen as a more obscure or niche genre. But now, indie music is reaching a bigger audience than ever before. Consequently, more people are exploring not only the artists’ music, but the genre as a whole, and we have TikTok to thank for this. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/924e648f2377e888a4a13f17fcffe12a?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/924e648f2377e888a4a13f17fcffe12a?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamle/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tam Le</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tam is currently studying cellular and developmental biology.
