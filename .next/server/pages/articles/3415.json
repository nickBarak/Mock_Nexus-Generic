Of all of my experiences as a Gaucho, some of my most thrilling were when Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers came to UCSB in October of 1999 and deeply and visibly engaged the campus community into a magical wave of purple and gold euphoria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was extremely exciting when the Lakers announced that they would return to UCSB for their training camp. They had been there the prior season, but I had been too engrossed in midterms to participate (they were there in February of 1999 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a strange time for NBA training camp </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to a strike-shortened season). This time, the Lakers would be on campus from early to mid-October, right after the school year started. Perfect! No need for much studying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakers conducted their practices at Rob Gym.  Being a lifelong, die-hard Lakers fan, I was determined to connect with the players, and I had the two necessary items that would help me accomplish this. The prior summer, I had bought a gold Shaq jersey, and I had also just purchased what remains my most prized possession </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Sector 9 longboard that I still skate with in 2020. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided that I was going to get as many Lakers as possible to sign my jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve this goal, I decided to use the skateboard to my advantage. I figured out that I could place my jersey on top of the longboard and hand the entire board to the players I wanted to sign my jersey.  That way, it took up a lot of space in their field of vision and it would be harder to refuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One afternoon during the training camp, I stood at the exit to Rob Gym where the players would pass as they got onto their bus. The players began exiting the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, Shaq signed nothing as he passed, saying with pomp: “I’m not signing anything.” It’s all good. He wasn’t the one I wanted anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of other players signed autographs though. I handed my skateboard to five players who signed my jersey: Robert Horry, Tyronn Lue, Derek Fisher, Glen Rice and one Kobe Bryant. For the last 21 years, I’ve been skating on my board, loving that Kobe held it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes, all the Lakers got on the bus — except Kobe. Kobe kept signing and signing, with a smile. Finally, the bus with the players on it started honking at him! He just ignored the honking. He kept signing away outside of Rob Gym, again, with a smile on his face. He was doing what he wanted to do </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> making the fans happy </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regardless of his teammates’ wishes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Kobe got on the bus and the Lakers departed, my jaw dropped as I realized that I had hit the mother lode </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was standing there next to Rob Gym with a bright gold Lakers jersey with the signatures of five players, including one superstar.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92519\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"708944687\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92411\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92519\" data-attachment-id=\"92519\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/alum-recounts-how-kobe-brought-purple-gold-euphoria-to-ucsb/img_9134/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1152\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9134\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92519\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92519\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Jonathan Neal</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My time interacting with the Lakers was not through, however. At the end of camp, the Lakers held a free intrasquad scrimmage for the UCSB community at the Thunderdome.  In Phil Jackson’s book, “More Than a Game,” he discusses this public practice, stating “we were certainly well hosted in Santa Barbara.” Jackson also refers to UCSB as “one of the most beautiful college campuses in the country.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right outside the Thunderdome, the Lakers showed up in front of a handful of fans, and walked into the arena basically in a line. I asked Phil Jackson for an autograph (even calling him Mr. Jackson) but he told me that he had to start practice. Fair enough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last player who passed? A certain Kobe Bean Bryant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I called to him. “Kobe!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He turned his head toward me: “Yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can I get my picture taken with you?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sure,” he said. He walked the 15 feet or so from the entrance of the building to where I was standing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me point out that this was in the pre-digital camera era. I didn’t even own a camera. Before I showed up to the T-Dome, I bought a disposable camera from the Isla Vista Market, just in case I got lucky, and as Kobe approached, I gave the camera to some random dude to take it, hoping that he wouldn’t blow my chance for a souvenir for the ages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kobe came up to me and wrapped his arm tightly around my shoulders, like I was his little brother. The disposable camera snapped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Thanks, man,” I said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re welcome,” said the future Hall-of-Famer, Olympic gold medalist and five-time NBA world champion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in absolute nirvana. I was flying above the ground. It was a total exhilaration. I was dizzy. Kobe had shown himself to be, without a doubt, the most accessible Laker, the kindest one and the most devoted to his fans. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92518\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"256188549\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92411\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92518\" data-attachment-id=\"92518\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/alum-recounts-how-kobe-brought-purple-gold-euphoria-to-ucsb/img_9057/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1894&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1894\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9057\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?fit=250%2C231&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?fit=888%2C821&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92518\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=888%2C821\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"821\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=250%2C231&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=1024%2C947&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=768%2C710&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1421&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92518\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Jonathan Neal.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, the Lakers meandered their way into the room, unannounced. There was big applause for all of the players. Except there was one player missing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the youngest player on the team. When Kobe nonchalantly entered the arena, there was a cacophony of ear-splitting applause, a standing ovation for the ages, one that put the thunder in the Thunderdome. The deafening ovation was even bigger than the crowd had given for superstar Shaquille O’Neal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scrimmage itself was delicious. It was the purple team against the gold team. For pure fans, how wonderful is it to see players on one’s favorite team play one another? I wish I had more precise memories of the game, but I clearly was in the afterglow of my time with Kobe. I just remember being so happy. Feeling so lucky. To be at my beloved, beautiful university and to have the basketball team I had loved since I was 6 years old visit my campus and interact with me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA Championship that season for the first time in 12 years. They clinched it exactly two days after I walked in my graduation ceremony on June 17, 2000. So two extremely meaningful and emotional life events for me happened within a week. The Lakers also won the championship the next year … and finished off the three-peat the following season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want everyone reading this to remember this: The three-peat all started in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent half of my life watching Kobe dazzle and amaze. I always thought that he would be an ambassador for the Lakers and the NBA for the next 40 or 50 years. I am deeply sad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I remember this story, I feel immense gratitude and love </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for my magical and wonderful college experience at UCSB, for basketball, the Lakers and for Kobe Bryant. The experiences I’m recounting happened 20 years ago, but they feel like they went down yesterday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My memories as a Gaucho are sweet and exhilarating. In the midst of my sorrow about the loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, my wonderful recollections from when Kobe and the Lakers came to campus are swirling in my mind. Thank you, Kobe, for being so kind and friendly to the fans, and, for the briefest of moments, making me feel like we were 21-year-old brothers.</span></p>\n<p><img id=\":qv\" class=\"aQG aYB\" src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2?ui=2&amp;ik=19b85fc9cf&amp;attid=0.4&amp;permmsgid=msg-f%3A1657105471226878025&amp;th=16ff38a577d59849&amp;view=fimg&amp;realattid=16ff3874f5b38d68f21&amp;disp=thd&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ9UVr26jcg0YfNr0DGxztKet3EPcb5Ul6HLTF7GzKxKm9nM9P2NMc4Jl_mq1wDMCIMa6P14rKi15muIXX7_dg_nA-l0_afgRfvVY_2SVcvOEvgo1SA44XpjWU0&amp;ats=2524608000000&amp;sz=w180-h120-df-p-nu\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Jonathan Neal graduated from UCSB in 2000 with majors in Business Economics and Political Science.

three key lifts: the squat, bench press and deadlift.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, we were able to talk to the president of UCSB’s Santa Barbara Powerlifting (SBPL) Club, Justin Holcomb, and club member Arianna Tong, to ask about their individual thoughts and emotions about the club and the sport.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b>, Leonard Paulasa: Hi guys, thank you both for doing this interview. To start, I would like to ask each of you how you got involved in powerlifting?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Holcomb: I was introduced to powerlifting through this club my freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arianna Tong: I started powerlifting about a year ago, actually, May 2018. I learned a bit from water polo, but I started lifting more weights when I was trying to lose weight.</span></p>\n<p><b>LP: Do either of you have any stories on how or why you started taking it seriously?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JH: I wanted to join a meet in June 2016, so about eight months after I joined the team, I started training for powerlifting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AT: The weight loss journey is really when I felt a sense of empowerment and rush to return to the gym. I remember my multiple failed attempts of a deadlift, but when I finally lifted that, I felt a sense of triumph, and that’s when I really fell in love with powerlifting.</span></p>\n<p><b>LP: How did you discover the powerlifting club?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JH: My hallmate told me about it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AT: I became involved after Justin approached me and asked if I wanted to join.</span></p>\n<p><b>LP: Arianna, what’s it like to be in a male-dominated sport and to be doing something that’s socially “unfeminine”?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AT: Honestly, it’s still an issue that I struggle with daily. You have a personal responsibility to own your craft. Sometimes, men just don’t find muscles physically attractive, or it’s unnatural for a 5’3” girl to be squatting a lot of weight. But that’s O.K. I just have to understand that not everyone is going to accept or like physical changes. Someone who I would consider a female role model is actually someone on our team — Avilia Lieu. I love the way she carries herself, and she’s an absolute unit. She handles her success with grace and poise, and she’s inspiring for women trying to get into powerlifting.</span></p>\n<p><b>LP: What do you have to say to the people that don’t consider powerlifting a sport?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JH: Powerlifting is a sport to the extent that it’s a competitive expression of physical skills. It aims to isolate and test muscular strength, which means minimizing focus on other athletic qualities. Success in more traditional sports depends on the integration of these qualities, but that distinction doesn’t make powerlifting more or less of a sport than others.</span></p>\n<p><b>LP: Do either of you have anything to say about SBPL or to the people interested in joining but are too intimidated?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JH: The thought that leads to intimidation is something like, “I’m not strong enough to be accepted by these people.” Let me ask you, have you ever seen someone trying [something] new and thought, “Wow, they’re not very good, so I don’t want to be friends with them”? No. So don’t tell yourself that. I want people to know that SBPL is about building a community; bonding with other people through an individual sport is how we grow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AT: I initially brushed off Justin, actually, and thought, “I’m not strong enough to lift as much weight as the people on the team.” But similar to what Justin said, it’s really not about how much weight you can lift. SBPL is about creating an inclusive community who are passionate about the same thing we’re passionate about. I met some of my closest friends here and have become a better athlete and competitor.</span></p>\n<p><b>LP: Thanks guys!

Angie Banks/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Division 1 volleyball at the NCAA level is no joke, and for incoming freshmen there is often a learning curve that comes with adjusting to a higher level of play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these newcomers are forced to wait their turn behind more experienced players who have earned their roles over the course of their collegiate career. This allows them to sit back and learn about their new environment so that by the time their name is called, they will be mentally and physically prepared to play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The path toward contributing to your team’s success usually involves some waiting and learning on the part of younger players, but not in the case of UCSB’s star freshman setter, Olivia Lovenberg. The San Diego native had earned the starting setter position before the Gauchos opened their season and consequently she was forced to adjust on the fly. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t really expecting it, but it’s been amazing,” Lovenberg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Needless to say, she accepted her role and excelled immediately as she put up four double-doubles with assists and digs in her first six games, and she kept her production consistent throughout the entire season as she led the Big West Conference in assists per set. There are benefits to learning from the sidelines, but there is no substitute for getting game-reps and learning while on the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young players are forced to go through the difficult period of getting used to the college level, and they can ease this transition along if other new players are there alongside them. This year’s class of newcomers includes one transfer along with seven freshmen, one of whom was Lovenberg. She claims that she benefited from being a part of a larger freshman class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was definitely nice to come in with a bigger class because we have such an intense everyday schedule,” Lovenberg said. “So coming in with these girls who are going through the same things as you are was super helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A group of young, talented players is a great indicator of future success, but in order to succeed in the present moment, a team needs its veterans to contribute on the floor as well as mentor the underclassmen. The Gauchos have three seniors on the roster this season who all mean a lot to newcomers such as Lovenberg.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three seniors that we’re losing are a super big part of our team, but we’re all really close like a family, so I think our chemistry will carry over and we’ll be able to come out strong next year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season as a whole for the Gauchos had its ups and downs, but they managed to put it all together for a stretch run as they won five of their last seven matches, including three straight wins to finish the season in fourth place in the Big West at 9-7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I definitely think it was a huge momentum change,” Lovenberg said. “Those three games were all consistent, really good team wins that I think really helped us moving forward to next year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB ended its season on a high note, but as this year’s highly-touted freshman class gets a year older and a new class of freshmen join next year, the expectations will undoubtedly be higher. Lovenberg is aware of the raised expectations and is willing to embrace them in order to take the next step as a team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the expectations are probably going to grow and we’re all gonna work harder,” Lovenberg said. “It will create a friendly  competitive environment and we’re all gonna strive to be the best we can be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With her freshman season in the books, and a Big West All-Freshman team to her name, Olivia Lovenberg is on the fast track to success at the college level. Paired with a young team on the rise,  Lovenberg’s talents and mindset should allow for a promising future for Gaucho volleyball.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the

Specifically, teams like the Broncos, Bengals, Dolphins, and Redskins will all hope to be in a spot where they can land their guy at the quarterback position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year doesn’t seemingly offer a multitude of quarterbacks that scream ‘franchise’, as compared to previous years. Plus, when you factor in teams like the Patriots with Tom Brady and the Giants with Eli Manning, both of who may be vying for a future replacement to their veteran stars, the demand for this particular position may not necessarily meet the supply. Still, Oklahoma QB Kyler Murray, the projected first overall pick in the draft, and Ohio State QB Dwayne Haskins are the two names that stand out in the first round. Don’t be surprised if a team trades up past their competitors in order to secure one of these two players.     </span></p>\n<p><b>Don’t Sleep on the OL</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of franchise quarterbacks, someone’s got to protect them. Although selecting an offensive lineman in the first round may not be the flashiest choice to go with, it’s still vastly important nonetheless. This is particularly true for my Eagles, who like to believe future Hall of Fame tackle Jason Peters can play for an eternity. For the love of all that is holy, he can’t protect Carson Wentz forever, no matter how much we want him to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year’s draft, especially, there’s plenty of talent to go around at the tackle and guard positions; teams would be wise to pay particular attention to these players that just might be defending their trenches for years to come. To name just a few: Alabama guard Jonah Williams, Florida tackle Jawaan Taylor, and Washington State tackle Andre Dillard are all worthy of an early first-round selection.   </span></p>\n<p><b>The Year of the Defensive Lineman</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the positions in this year’s draft, the depth of talent is most noticeable amongst defensive linemen. I’m not just talking a few scattered picks here and there, but there’s a distinct possibility that a quarter of all the first round picks may go to just pass-rushers and run-stoppers alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I can write a long list of immediate-impact players: Ohio State DE Nick Bosa, Michigan DE Rashan Gary, Alabama DT Quinnen Williams, and Kentucky EDGE Josh Allen, all seem to be consensus top-10 picks. Besides the quarterback position, the defensive linemen in this draft are the next likely to warrant a trade up from teams on Thursday night.   </span></p>\n<p><b>Running Backs Running Into the 2</b><b>nd</b><b> Round</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spoiler alert: It is not the year of the running back. That being said, the dearth of big names shouldn’t take away from the excitement surrounding the prospects at this position, it’s just one of those years where none particularly standout and the majority of them may fall to later rounds. Regardless, don’t expect your team to address any of these backfield needs this early on into the draft.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the running back position tends to be undervalued at times due to durability concerns, various teams will still be in the market for these offensive playmakers. If a running back does happen to go in the first round, the Raiders seem to be the most likely suitor in most mock drafts.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Good, The Bad, and The Media</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the Raiders, the media is at it once again. Days before the draft, drama is being stirred up as rumors are circulating concerning Oakland’s draft day plans. Specifically the rumor is that they’re planning “surprise picks with their three first-round selections”. Whether or not you believe this is a ploy purposely leaked from the Raiders’ brass, we recommend you don’t look to deep into it and just wait for the Draft regardless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a more blatant note, the Cardinals are also taking part in these pre-Draft shenanigans by suggesting their first overall pick isn’t quite settled just yet. Throughout the offseason reports have constantly assured that Kyler Murray will be taken at first overall, mainly because of his ties to Arizona head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Along with these last-minute ‘adjustments’ that honestly may just be a ruse to drive up their current quarterback Josh Rosen’s trade value, it has also been reported that Murray doesn’t like watching film in preparation for game day. Stop it. He’s got all the tools to be great in the NFL and his college tape only supports his dedication to the process. So, dear media, let him play and stop trying to ruin his chances at securing the bag.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87755\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/top-storylines-to-follow-heading-into-the-2019-nfl-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87755\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/top-storylines-to-follow-heading-into-the-2019-nfl-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/top-storylines-to-follow-heading-into-the-2019-nfl-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/top-storylines-to-follow-heading-into-the-2019-nfl-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/top-storylines-to-follow-heading-into-the-2019-nfl-draft/","id":3414,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3413,3412,3411],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
