Strauss Foundation, a program that funds public service projects, in hopes of starting such an organization on campus. After learning about the OTI’s similar goals through a student leader summit on the issue, Ofer and fellow Gaucho Saleh Abdulla — at the time the co-president of the Muslim Student Association — helped bring OTI to the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“When we presented our initial idea around the university, our kind of thing was: an ex-Israeli Defense Force soldier and a Yemeni Muslim … and co-president of the Muslim Student Association are trying to work together to bring this incredible experience to other UCSB students and to the UCSB community,” Ofer said.</p>\n<p>According to Ofer, OTI stepped in to provide a “middle ground” between some of the viewpoints on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want the conflict to be perpetuated on our campus,” Ofer said. “There’s enough conflict going around and as students, we are going to be making the policy in the future … It is really important that we are educated on these issues so we can make positive influences when we are in those positions.”</p>\n<p>Over the summer of 2010, Ofer and fellow UCSB student Omer Harari traveled with OTI to the Middle East. Last summer, Co-Presidents Atapour and Medovoy, together with Mousa and graduate advisor Mike Schwartz, doubled the previous number of UCSB delegates to the Olive Tree Initiative and are currently active in the growing organization on campus.</p>\n<p><em>This is the second of three installments of the feature titled The Olive Tree Initiative.

One year later, Wehrenfennig and 15 fellow UCI students and two faculty members left the West Coast for the Middle East on OTI’s inaugural trip.</p>\n<p>Upon his return from OTI’s maiden voyage, Wehrenfennig said the program’s feedback made it obvious that the Initiative had found a niche in the UC system.</p>\n<p>“It very soon became clear that there is really a huge need to continue that kind of educational response to the questions that we have to deal with on campus when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Wehrenfennig said.</p>\n<p>The program has since expanded to six UC campuses, but only Irvine, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Santa Cruz have sent students abroad. Two new chapters at Berkeley and San Diego are gearing up to send their first delegates this upcoming summer.</p>\n<p>During the most recent expedition, the student diplomats spoke with royalty and servicemen, including a former Israel Defense Forces soldier on one day and the prince of Jordan on another — and often met with up to six or seven individuals each day, covering a wide range of opinions on the conflict.</p>\n<p>Atapour, a fourth-year political science major and co-president of OTI, said that unlike many other campus groups that discuss contemporary Middle Eastern issues, the organization goes to great lengths to remain unbiased toward any single point of view or political opinion.</p>\n<p>“Overall, the most important thing is to have this outlet on campus that people [can] go to that emphasizes education and not political advocacy,” Atapour said.</p>\n<p><em>This is the first of three installments of the Olive Tree Initiative feature.

Regents of the University of California, et al. — has worked its way through the federal court system and is a combination of the University of California (UC) case as well as similar DACA cases in the District of Columbia and New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was created by an executive order under former President Barack Obama in 2012. The program provides two-year repeated deferments from deportation and a work permit to individuals who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB74r7NE0A7btCgQX8od_5u0oogA\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal battle began in September 2017 when acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607871000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDw312g5cu8l9yoc1brbCBOrktxw\">announced</a> the Trump administration was ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just three days after the decision to end DACA was announced, the UC filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the “first university board to sue the government,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-filing-amicus-briefs-support-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607874000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcVJLBEAIOAKsdIDfspxkSgAjUuw\">press release</a> from the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit puts UC President Janet Napolitano in a unique position. As president, her office is leading the fight nationwide to protect DACA — the signature legislation she helped create in 2012 as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for the Obama administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Neither I, nor the University of California, take the step of suing the federal government lightly, especially not the very agency that I led,” Napolitano said. “To arbitrarily and capriciously end the DACA program, which benefits our country as a whole, is not only unlawful, it is contrary to our national values and bad policy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are nearly 700,000 DACA recipients currently in the program, which includes “approximately 1,700 UC students,” according to UCOP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-DACA-Complaint.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607872000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbbp7en5OHiiYOlbelFwnekcqrXg\">lawsuit</a> alleges the Trump administration rescinded the program on “nothing more than unreasoned executive whim,” and that its removal is “unconstitutional, unjust, and unlawful.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal court granted an injunction to temporarily stop the Department of Homeland Security’s recission of DACA in January 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an unusual attempt, President Trump tried to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s hearing of the case, moving directly to the U.S. Supreme Court — but the justices denied his appeal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case went on as scheduled to the Ninth Circuit, and in November of 2018, the court ruled in favor of the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last June, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the DACA case in November 2019, beginning oral arguments this upcoming Tuesday, with expectations to have a decision in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case presents two specific questions: whether it is up to the courts to decide DACA’s fate, and if so, whether the decision to rescind the DACA program was “arbitrary and capricious.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is no dispute that this decision has life-changing implications for nearly 700,000 DACA participants and their families,” the Regent’s briefing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/20190927151220415_18-587-Regents-Brief-for-Respondents.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607878000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEj-h4CmfaWS_4hT0IjEYZhwmfjMg\">reads</a>. “Yet the Acting Secretary provided only a single vague sentence of explanation for the decision that leaves basic questions unanswered.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-president-janet-napolitano-filing-supreme-court-brief-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzPIBYHwjcOkR8r6nf7IsxddiKjQ\">statement</a> released in September, Napolitano argued that the Trump administration acted illegally because it offered no “valid justification” for ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Five federal courts have considered this issue and found that the administration’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, and therefore unlawful,” Napolitano said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court briefing mentioned that the administration waited seven months to end the program and that Trump had previously indicated he “would allow DREAMers to stay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Department of Homeland Security argued that DACA is illegal because it is a violation of immigration law and was enacted not through Congress, but as an executive order under former President Obama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[DACA] was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” said former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Duke in memorandum announcing DACA’s recission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the past month, UCOP began a system-wide campaign in support of DACA, including a social media campaign where prominent UC leaders and national politicians have given reasons for why they stand with DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign also includes an online <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actnow.io/embed/widget/app/vwOv7u9?parentPage%3Dd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNpdHlvZmNhbGlmb3JuaWEuZWR1L2RhY2EtYnVpbGQ%253D%26frameId%3Dj1ild&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607880000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKYXoHlNlEl8qhWsyHHYOGX-2YYA\">pledge</a>

Besides the court case, UC leaders are working with Congress to create bipartisan legislation providing long-term legal protections for DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Supreme Court does not disclose dates for its decisions, but a ruling must be made before the end of its yearly term in June 2020. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

At the time, however, we were so keen on the act of registering students to vote that it’s possible we overlooked the importance of the next step: strictly nonpartisan voter education,” Winnett said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Campus Dems and College Republicans, as well as CALPIRG, helped out tremendously with distributing materials to the student body at large, and I’m thrilled that there will now be another outlet through which students can find reliable information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has been a leader in student voter registration for decades because students have crafted a culture of civic engagement that is second to none,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited to see the passage of AB 963 because I see it as a step towards taking the model for voter registration that we have at UCSB statewide.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/","id":3512,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":[3511,3510,3509],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
