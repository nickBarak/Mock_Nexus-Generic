It will be offered only through the UCSB extension program.</p>\n<p>Abboud, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) general manager and Santa Barbara City College trustee, designed the course. He will be teaching it this spring with the help of occasional guest speakers.</p>\n<p>Abboud recently submitted a tentative syllabus for the class in the form of a proposal, which, if approved, will allow him to the class to run next quarter.</p>\n<p>“I’m really looking forward to it because I know it is going to be hard this first time doing it, but it is a way for me to pass on what I’ve learned,” Abboud said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>This is not his first experience teaching a course at UCSB, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>In Winter Quarter 2014, he taught a course called “Politics of the University of California” where students learned about the inner workings of the university and its role on a statewide platform.</p>\n<p>On top of teaching at UCSB, Abboud also has experience in the area of grassroots campaigning, which he developed both in and out of school.</p>\n<p>After graduating, Abboud launched multiple successful grassroots campaigns, which ultimately led to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/csd-takes-first-steps-in-i-v-governance/\">formation of I.V. CSD</a>.</p>\n<p>The director of UCSB’s Leadership and Advocacy Program, Patricia Fancher, initially approached Abboud to create a syllabus and teach a class on campaign design.</p>\n<p>Although the course name implies campaigning, that is not necessarily what the class is about, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>“When people use the word campaigning, they probably mean going out and getting votes, but that’s not what this class is for… The class is about how to build support for your idea and advance it.”</p>\n<p>The class will take place over 10 weeks, during which students will work toward creating a campaign portfolio. The portfolio will include a plan to campaign either on campus or in I.V. “to enact some positive change” in their respective communities, according to the syllabus proposal.</p>\n<p>Each week of the class will highlight a different component of the campaigning process – ranging from volunteer recruitment to branding and communications – in order add more tools to students’ campaigning belts, according to the syllabus.</p>\n<p>The course is structured similarly to that of most courses at UCSB, but places a heavier emphasis on technical skills and less on theories, said Abboud.</p>\n<p>“The class does have some theory in it, but a lot of it is going to be more practical skills based, like how to facilitate a meeting or how to do a power map. Hopefully people can take the things they learn in their theory classes and see how they relate to this.”</p>\n<p>Although the class doesn’t begin until April, Abboud has high hopes along with some nerves.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had some experience to make this less scary than it can be, but it definitely is an exciting opportunity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Their attack is led by Raúl González, who is the UEFA competition’s all time scorer with 71 goals and leads the team in champion league goals this year with five. Raúl González netted against defending champion Inter Milan in both legs of the quarter final, and his clever lob pass set up defensive strongman Benedikt Höwedes for the team’s seventh goal in the two-match series. Prior to that Schalke defeated Spanish club Valencia CF and have allowed just eight goals throughout the tournament.</p>\n<p>But the Royal Blues of FC Schalke 04 have their work cut out for them. Manchester United have proven to be one of the best defensive teams in the world, allowing just three goals in ten UEFA matches this year. Manchester defeated Premier League rivals Chelsea FC in the first elimination round and bested Olympique de Marseille in the round of sixteen. Though scoring has been a problem for the Red Devils, with just 12 goals in the tournament, strikers like Wayne Rooney and Javier Hernández need only the slightest opportunity to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>However, the Germans open the series at home, which could spur them to take an all-important lead heading back to Manchester. Bear in mind that Schalke are without a loss in the competition since day one, when they were beaten 1-0 by Lyon. The Germans have more than earned their place in the semifinals and will be eager to prove it while Manchester will have it all to lose. The match will be televised on Fox Soccer channel at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>FC Barcelona v. Real Madrid CF</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kirk Reed</em></p>\n<p>One of the biggest rivalries in all of sports is under the spotlight during the world’s most prestigious soccer events this year, as FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF face off in the semifinal round of the UEFA Champions League Tournament.</p>\n<p>The first leg of the two-match semifinal series — set for April 27 in Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu — will be the second four matches in three weeks between the two clubs. In a highly anticipated matchup, Real Madrid beat Spanish La Liga for Barcelona to win the Copa Del Rey on a header from forward Christian Ronaldo in extra time last week.</p>\n<p>In manager José Mourinho’s first year with the Spanish club, Real Madrid has played exceptionally well in the Champions League to advance past the round of 16 for the first time in five years. With a potent attack led by Ronaldo and Ángel di María, Real Madrid defeated English club Tottenham Hotspur FC to reach the semifinals.</p>\n<p>Argentine forward Lionel Messi and his teammates have continued their domination on the pitch this season by controlling possession and attacking with patience. Barcelona defeated Premier League club Arsenal and then Ukranian soccer club Shakhtar Donetsk in the quarterfinals to again advance to the semifinal round of the UEFA Champions League, where they lost to eventual champion Inter Milan last year. But the hopeful return of injured Captain Carles Puyol will be crucial to help a banged-up Barcelona defense.</p>\n<p>When Barcelona and Real Madrid take the pitch, the event is more than a soccer match. Two giants of the sport and their communities of dedicated fans clash to decide superiority. With a spot in the finals of the UEFA Champions League at stake, Wednesday’s match will showcase soccer at its finest. The match will be televised on FX at 11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/","id":3057,"author":{"id":296,"name":"Kirk Reed"},"related":[3056,3055,3054],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senators Confirm New Appointees, Listen to New Executives","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"During Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting, senators approved committee appointments for the 2013 – 2014 school year.

Speakers also called to question the clarity of the appointment process, particularly with regards to Committee on Committees and Elections Committee.</p>\n<p>University Owned Housing Senator for the 2012–2013 school year Miya Sommers addressed the Senate with concerns about the appointment process. Sommers took issue with the disqualification of Nicholas Dineen for Elections Committee on the grounds of party affiliation, as Dineen had been disqualified after he “liked” a Democratic Process Party Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel that going through someone’s Facebook and seeing something that they like on Facebook is grounds for neutrality,” Sommers said.</p>\n<p>Sommers also said the disqualification process was problematic as there had been inconsistencies for different positions. While Dineen had been originally recommended for the position through the interview process, he had later been disqualified, Sommers said.</p>\n<p>According to Sommers, the appointee for Attorney General Sawyeh Maghsoodloo should have been disqualified on the same grounds, as the attorney general position is also supposed to be a neutral position and Maghsoodloo was a chair of the Open People’s Party during A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“If he’s not being appointed, I have a problem with Sawyeh then being appointed,” Sommers said. “She has a clear party affiliation, and she’s not being docked on that.”</p>\n<p>After Sommers spoke, Maghsoodloo addressed the Senate to respond to some of Sommers’ claims. Maghsoodloo said she agreed the interview process needed improvement, but also said her own appointment had been legitimate.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Chair of Committee on Committees Asami Osato also came to public forum in order to answer senators’ questions regarding the application process. As chair, Osato was responsible for making the official appointment recommendations to the president.</p>\n<p>Osato said she felt the application process had been fair, with the interview process lasting approximately 15 hours every week for three weeks. She also said she felt party affiliation was not difficult to discern with candidates.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s pretty obvious whether or not you’re party affiliated,” Osato said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also decided to approve the appointments and during the meeting, the new executive officers delivered reports on their first weeks in office. Officers announced their decisions regarding their appointments for staff, while also discussing the progress of their respective offices.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore said he met with leaders of the queer community, who had expressed a desire to reach out to members of Greek life on campus.</p>\n<p>“They want to do some Greek outreach because they feel like there’s some problems coming from the fraternities especially,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate said she is focusing on the question of online education in the UC system, for which there are currently two bills in front of the California Senate.</p>\n<p>“The bills are SB 520, which we really don’t like because it basically is going to allow for the privatization of our education, allowing for private entities to come in and profit,” Choate said. “Another one is SB 547, but it doesn’t have nearly as much support in the Senate, as of right now.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud discussed the addition of a new position on his staff — the deputy chief of staff — while Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s report focused on transitions to the new Senate, discussing projects that must be handed down to new senators, including a Sobering Center in Isla Vista and an LGBTQ General Education requirement.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said he is working on a convention with the SAGs from colleges throughout Southern California, and that he has already begun working on his advocacy agenda.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/","id":3058,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3057,3056,3055],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
