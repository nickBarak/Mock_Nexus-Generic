It will produce a net total of approximately $740,000 per year, according to Spencer Brandt, I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board secretary.</p>\n<p>This was the CSD’s second attempt to secure consistent funding following the failure of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\">Measure F</a> in 2016, which left the CSD without a primary source of funding.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R 2018” campaign – spearheaded by Brandt, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, CSD President Ethan Bertrand and UC Santa Barbara Campus Democrats outgoing President Emily Murray – has been promoting the measure since the end of UCSB’s Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“Throughout this whole process, we’ve organized a group of passionate community volunteers to speak with residents about the issues that matter to them,” Bertrand said. “We knocked on every door in Isla Vista at least three times, some doors we hit up to six times.”</p>\n<p>Most I.V. residents will pay the tax, but Brandt said the CSD is currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75 percent vs. 17.25 percent.</p>\n<p>Approximately 23,000 people live in I.V. as of the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217#qf-flag-X\">most recently conducted</a> census in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>Initial results from the Vote By Mail and Mailed Ballot Results reported 56.34 percent yes votes and 43.66 percent no votes on the measure.</p>\n<p>However, these numbers jumped to 71.04 percent yes votes and 23.64 percent no votes once votes from the first precincts came in. The percentage of yes votes rose throughout the night from there, while the percentage of no votes steadily decreased.</p>\n<p>“We were sort of cautiously optimistic, but when that first polling station came in, and we were up, that was just insane,” Brandt said. “I don’t think any of us believed it…I was crying, I think a lot of us were.”</p>\n<p>Murray, a second-year history and public policy major, shared Brandt’s sentiments.</p>\n<p>“I walked up to Rincon, and Spencer ran out and said, ‘We did it!’” Murray said. “I was overjoyed…when we found out we won by a lot, that was amazing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the CSD’s second attempt to secure funding. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, the pro-Measure R group <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/how-much-are-pro-anti-measure-r-groups-spending-for-your-vote/\">raised</a> $35,630.25 and spent $7,107.67 as of May 19, according to <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByFilerName.aspx\">campaign filings</a> with the Santa Barbara County.

Community Resource Building, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“I’m just elated and so excited for the good work that we can do for the people of Isla Vista, from opening the community center to improving public safety to continuing to work on tenant-landlord issues,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Deputies searched the area and located the subject, who provided false identification as James “Parilo.” The name “Parilo” was not found during a records check, despite several attempts to locate a match. The subject continued to provide the name “Parilo” and a false date of birth, until a California identification card was located in his wallet and he was identified as James Parillo. Parillo had an active warrant out for his arrest in Georgia and chose not to be extradited. He was ultimately arrested for providing a false identification and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, a large swastika was found scratched into the hood of a black Lexus in a carport at 6500 Cordoba. Law enforcement determined the vandalism had no apparent target, as the victim said she did not have disputes with anyone and is not Jewish.</p>\n<p>During the Friday day shift, IVFP deputies responded to ongoing complaints from the Isla Vista Elementary School staff concerning vehicles parked illegally in front of the school. The staff reported that the illegally parked vehicles were obstructing parents’ vehicles as they dropped off and picked up their children from school and that it constituted safety hazard because it forced students to walk in the middle of the roadway to get to school. IVFP deputies issued 28 parking citations and 16 warnings that gave the vehicle owners 72 hours to move their cars.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP recorded 21 physical, 17 adult and 4 juvenile arrests and issued dozens of citations. On the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde, deputies arrested four students during a fight involving more than eight people using fists and a broken cane. The subjects resisted arrest and had to be subdued with impact weapons. La Jolla High School student Jake Rosenthal, his brother and UCSB student Bryce Rosenthal and Santa Barbara City College student Mason Rutherford were treated by American Medical Response on scene and booked into county jail. The juvenile who started the fight was visiting I.V. from San Diego with the Rosenthal brothers and was booked into Santa Maria Juvenile Hall for providing a false identification.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday, deputies found Garrett Kosloff in his vehicle snorting a line of Xanax on the 6700 block of Trigo Road. He was also in possession of a half-pound of marijuana that he admitted to selling to his friends. Kosloff was arrested and booked into county jail. Deputies also found students in possession of marijuana and alcohol when they responded to a noise complaint concerning a property on the 6600 block of El Colegio. Upon searching the property, deputies found underage female students from the English First (EF) language school in Santa Barbara, drinking alcohol. The party hosts, EF student Armendariz Izquierda and UCSB student Luis Ortiz, were arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors. The EF students were released from the IVFP station to EF staff.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, IVFP recorded seven physical arrests and 12 citations. On Sunday, IVFP units assisted the UCPD with an area search near Phelps Road and Cannon Green Drive, after a report of multiple females screaming in the area. Units searched westbound on foot along the bluffs and ended up at Ellwood Elementary, but made no discoveries.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61561\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61561\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/","id":3780,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3779,3778,3777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVFP Reports Suicide Attempts, Theft, Prank Calls","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Last weekend yielded not too many occurrences thanks in part to Coachella, but included probation violations","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to a series of calls last weekend including theft, probation violation, three suicide attempts and a prank telephone call.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, a 46-year-old homeless man was stopped at Keg-N-Bottle just as he was about to step out of the store with a $40 bottle of Ketel One vodka under his jacket; he was arrested for shoplifting. His 22-page criminal history includes seven convictions for theft related offenses, including four cases of petty theft with a prior offense. All seven offenses involved time in custody and two were prison commitments.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies stopped a car because the occupants were not wearing their seatbelts while driving. During a consent search of the vehicle, deputies discovered hashish and a Vicodin pill in the car and a used hypodermic needle in the passenger’s pocket. The passenger is a self-admitted heroin addict and the driver, who was arrested for possession of the illegal substances, was on an “own recognizance release,” a written promise to appear at all court hearings, and on probation for burglary. Both were also charged with being under the influence of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, a subject threw themselves from the second story of their apartment building on the 800 block of Camino Lindo in an attempt to commit suicide. The subject, a UCSB student, was transported to a hospital and remains there in stable condition.</p>\n<p>According to law enforcement, Saturday night was relatively quiet, which officers credit to the popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival which draws many students out of town for the weekend.</p>\n<p>However, law enforcement dealt with another suicide scare this Saturday. IVFP received a call from a friend of the subject. The reporting party called from Ventura, stating that her friend, a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student, was reportedly in the I.V. area and was distraught. The caller reported the friend having said, “I am going to take the ultimate sleep,” after which she immediately telephoned law enforcement. Deputies were dispatched to check the local beaches, ultimately unsuccessfully and an attempt was made to locate the subject’s iPhone. Shortly after, a GPS located the phone in Los Alamos. Further investigation found that the subject lived in Nipomo and, according to the caller, could have possibly been driving home. The subject’s parents were contacted and some 30 minutes later the subject arrived home. The parents stated their son seemed fine and were advised to call 9-1-1 if they suspected he needed any mental health or emergency assistance.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, a student called to report his girlfriend had said she was going to kill herself. After confirming that threat was potentially plausible, units responded to her residence at 6600 block of Trigo to check on her welfare. However, they were unable to make contact, even after entry was made through an unsecured door. Further investigation and GPS cell phone locating revealed the woman was in the area of Veronica Springs Road near Elings Park in Santa Barbara, where one of her friends lives, according to the caller. Responding officers requested Goleta units check the area, along with the last known location of the phone; they were also provided with the subject’s vehicle description. All searches yielded negative results.</p>\n<p>Later on Sunday, a student called to say she and her sister received prank phone calls within an hour of each other. The student said her call was a partially pre-recorded computer voice intermixed with a live caller that was antagonistic. When she told the caller she was bored and was going to hang up, the caller became angry and cursed at her, calling her by name.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, the sister of the student said she was not threatened at all by the call and hung up after just a few seconds. It is suspected that the calls were related but no solid suspect could be determined and an investigation is ongoing.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/","id":3781,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3780,3779,3778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up April 10-12","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista law enforcement dealt with multiple reports from residents including an attempted suicide, a resistant probationer and a missing persons report last week.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista law enforcement dealt with multiple reports from residents including an attempted suicide, a resistant probationer and a missing persons report last week.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, day-shift deputies handled a residential burglary on the 6500 block of Trigo Road. After speaking with the victim, deputies collected evidence and established probable cause to arrest a female suspect.</p>\n<p>Thursday night, a female walked into the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) office and filed a report for an anonymous message she had read on the anonymous social network Yik Yak. The unidentified sender stated the individual had gone into the woods and tried to hang himself, but was unsuccessful when the branch of the tree he was using snapped. The sender continued to post that he was depressed because his parents had been killed the day before and that he had no desire to live. Deputies received an additional call for service stating that another reporting party had read the same message on Yik Yak and was concerned for the sender’s safety.</p>\n<p>Deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers tracked the location of the posting and organized a search stretching from the bluffs west of Camino Majorca out toward Campus Point, but failed to locate the sender. As the search was occurring, the sender deleted the original message and posted another stating his roommate had found him and taken him home. Law enforcement responded and searched the area once more, but was unable to locate any associated persons. A report was written and the search for the sender was canceled after all resources were utilized.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies went to a residence on the 6700 block of Abrego Road to conduct a probation search on a probationer. The probationer remained passive-aggressive throughout the encounter and delayed the investigation by not allowing deputies to search his electronic media. He was arrested and booked for resisting arrest and for violating his probation.</p>\n<p>Dispatch received a call on Saturday night that immediately hung up when answered. Upon callback, the anonymous reporting party alerted dispatch in Spanish that the probationer from the previous night was in a fight with his father. Deputies returned to the residence and found the probationer restrained by his father. Further investigation revealed the probationer punched his father during an argument, and the son was booked into City of Santa Barbara Jail after his father signed a citizen’s arrest for battery.</p>\n<p>Also on Saturday night, a victim reported from the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive said she woke to the sound of someone in her bedroom. Though she was unable to see the subject in the dark, the victim believed it was one of her roommates. The victim reported hearing her wallet being unzipped and the subject leaving the room, and later discovered $160 had been taken from her. She called her roommates and learned none of them were home, and the front door had been unlocked.</p>\n<p>Officers received a missing person’s report Saturday night of a female who was last seen walking westbound on the 6600 block of Pasado Road. The female was said to be highly intoxicated and ignored her friends’ attempts to take care of her. Officials conducted a search of the area and the female’s cell phone was remotely located, but the location was several hours old and the phone was powered off. It was later reported that the female returned home, and she was removed from the Missing and Unidentified Persons System.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, a victim reported her laptop was stolen from her home on the 6500 block of Segovia Road. The victim said she remembers seeing her computer on the couch as she left on Friday to go out for the evening. She said she did not return until 7 a.m. the following morning and discovered her laptop was gone.</p>\n<p>Another victim reported her bicycle was stolen from the 6700 block of Trigo Road on Sunday. The bike is described as a lime green, men’s, one-speed, Neco, “fixie” bike that was not registered with UCPD.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62409\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/weekend-wrap-up-april-10-12/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62409\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/weekend-wrap-up-april-10-12/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/weekend-wrap-up-april-10-12/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/weekend-wrap-up-april-10-12/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/weekend-wrap-up-april-10-12/","id":3782,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3781,3780,3779],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
