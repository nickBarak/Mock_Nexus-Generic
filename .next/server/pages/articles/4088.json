But the coronavirus pandemic has forced the group to convert its services into an online platform, according to Lori Goodman, the program’s director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, IVYP has pivoted to online materials, including activities and games that children and their parents can participate in together in lieu of IVYP’s normal services, Goodman said. But she added that bridging the digital divide has been a struggle for many families who use the online programs.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Not only do our families not have the kinds of computers they need and the Wi-Fi strength they need, they don’t have the computer literacy, and the same goes for some of our staff,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While facing challenges from the online-only format, IVYP is continuing to utilize online tools to support its families. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivyp.org/covid-19-resources.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online materials</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as “recreational activities, self-care, mindfulness and academic support” for elementary school-aged children are meant to help families who are struggling to adapt to at-home schooling for kids and remote work for parents, Goodman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the website offers articles in English and Spanish on how to talk to children who are struggling with social distancing and provides information on financial support resources for unemployed or furloughed workers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVYP is also implementing an online one-on-one tutoring program through Zoom for students whose parents might not have the skill sets to help them with homework, according to Goodman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to schooling resources, food insecurity has been “one of the largest issues” among families involved with IVYP, Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To support parents who are struggling to put food on the table, IVYP is delivering bagged, prepackaged food to families in I.V. By the third week of April, the program had delivered food to 200 families, and by the fourth week, over 300 families had been helped, according to Goodman. While this week’s numbers aren’t out yet, the growth of the program has been “exponential,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know people are struggling with food,” Goodman said, adding that being able to help people who need it “has been one of [our] biggest hopes.” Food donations are something that “always come up” when talking to families in I.V., she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman said that IVYP is also working with “extremely vulnerable” populations in the I.V. community, such as undocumented immigrants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since undocumented immigrants do not qualify to receive federal aid or stimulus checks, Goodman said that IVYP has been working with those families who are “out of a job, still paying taxes and becoming desperate” to provide them with community services and programs like the </span><a href=\"https://805undocufund.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">805 UndocuFund</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which can help provide financial assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While IVYP has seen success in helping those in need, other ventures from the community organization have been put on hold, Goodman said. Recent plans to host community events and other programs with the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) have been stalled, with no date in sight to resume, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll see how coronavirus impacts these plans, but we always want as much cooperation from the CSD as we can so we can put our resources together,” Goodman said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

The university has “no information on the details” of the fifth case, Yang said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD) is responsible for contact tracing for individuals with confirmed cases of coronavirus; the five cases confirmed in the research study have been referred to SBCPHD. It is unclear whether the three cases of coronavirus among I.V. residents announced by Yang overlap with three of the cases recently confirmed by Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County confirmed I.V.’s first case of coronavirus on March 30. Over two months later, the county confirmed the second case of coronavirus in I.V. on June 9.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judges of the 2019 UC Los Angeles Bollywood Fusion dance competition Jhoomti Shaam were about to announce the winners of that year’s competition. But the women of UCSB Taara — a dance team performing South Asian dance styles — had already decided they wouldn’t place at the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were so many amazing teams and we had accepted it. We were like, ‘You know what, we’re going to get last. And that’s okay,’” Natasha Nema, one of the group’s four founding members, said. “We were genuinely fine with getting last because we just couldn’t even believe that we were there in the first place against that many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group had been together for less than a year, and after scoping out the competition, they thought they didn’t stand a chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really weren’t even listening, cause we were like, ‘Oh, we don’t really care. Like, yeah, we’ll listen for second and first, sure. But third place, we don’t really care,” Nema recalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the judges announced the winners –– they placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t even comprehend that our name was being spoken, that we just paused for a little bit. And then we screamed, it was like two seconds later,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In less than a year since the group’s inception in June 2018, the four hopeful members became a winning team of 12 in their dream competition. That was in March 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year later, in February 2020, UCSB Taara took first place at Bollywood Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This June, the four original members of UCSB Taara –– Nema, Shivani Shah, Sejal Chandra and Jashanna Walia –– graduated from UCSB and said goodbye to the group they envisioned, nurtured and led to victory over two years. For those four women, leaving Taara “Gen One,” or what they call the first generation of UCSB Taara dancers, meant leaving a lasting legacy at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have our literal legacy on this campus and a part of us still at UCSB forever, I think, to me at least, is really, really special. It’s like a home you’ll always have when you visit campus and a bond you’ll always be a part of, no matter how old you get,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia recently passed the baton to a new generation of dancers, but they expect to watch the group progress for years to come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t even imagine being old enough to see Taara Gen 10 … It’s changed so much in just two years that I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like in another two years,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in the summer of 2018, the girls buckled down in brand building and recruiting efforts. They decided on their official name –– Taara, which means star in Hindi –– designed a logo, ordered team jerseys and hired a DJ to create a dance mix for their group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema handled the marketing side, which meant legitimizing the team, recruiting new members and defining their style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really wanted for people to take us seriously within the circuit because there were already so many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before creating Taara, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia were all in other Bollywood or Bhangra dance groups at UCSB but had frustrations with the groups’ leadership. So the four decided to create their own group: a competitive, all-female team that fused the styles of Bollywood, Bhangra, hip-hop and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But starting a new group meant that Taara didn’t have a proven reputation to help recruit dancers. New members would have to take a leap of faith, and the original four had to convince recruits  that Taara could go the distance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How do we get all these new people to trust us? How do we get these people to commit 20 hours a week, at least, of dancing, to get them to the next place where we can compete and where we can prove ourselves?” Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema took to social media, scouring Facebook pages for incoming freshmen and potential recruits, and even went as far as downloading dating apps. Some of the others made friends with dancers already in the competition circuit, Desi Dance Network, to learn insider tips. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At tryouts later that year, Taara accepted 12 new members, bringing the team to 18. But that number was quick to dwindle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Literally just two days later, girls would start dropping out” due to the time commitments,  Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time their first competition came around, their group was down to a solid 13 members, just one member more than the minimum required to compete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That year, UCSB Taara competed in back-to-back competitions for three straight weekends. After the first competition, one teammate dropped out on the drive back to UCSB. Now, they were down to 12, and the team had to rearrange dance formations for the next two weekends of competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders said that competition season was grueling for the team. Between balancing school schedules with dance practice, the four struggled to keep the team motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone’s grades are falling, no one is sleeping, everyone’s sick, you’re just practicing in parking lots,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taara didn’t have its own designated space to practice on campus, so the captains had to get creative in finding a space to dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would squeeze ourselves into tiny rooms,” Shah said. “We snuck into the theater building. We snuck into [the Humanities and Social Sciences Building]. We snuck into Rob Gym. We snuck into so many [buildings], just so that we could have some floor to dance on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the next weekend’s competition, Taara placed eighth –– last place. The girls used the week between that competition and their next to rearrange parts of their performance with feedback from the judges. At the last competition that season –– Jhoomti Shaam –– Taara placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Winning that, not only was it just amazing because it was our dream competition, but I think it finally showed the team that everything we did was for a reason,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team knew at that moment, claiming their trophy, that the tireless hours of practice, sleepless nights and long drives to competitions had paid off. For a team that wasn’t expecting to place at all, taking home third place was more than a victory — it was proof that Taara lived up to its name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a new generation of Taara prepares to take the reign, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia agree that Gen One created a precedent –– and a bond –– that will live on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gen One, especially, everyone just grew so close and over everything, it was just a family. I think even leaving it, I know that everyone’s still going to be a team forever, as cheesy as it sounds,” Walia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was no accident that Taara Gen One became a family since it was one of the group’s first goals when they set out to create Taara. They wanted to compete and impress, but mostly, they wanted to dance with people they loved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were 12 small girls, but we were the loudest girls in every room and we were just having the best time. And I think that like, like positive energy really just attracted others to us,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taara isn’t just a dance team. We’re also people, we’re good people. We want people to know that we’re friendly people and that is part of why we dance. It makes us happy. We want to share that happiness.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

It was a long off-season, one which featured the departures of thirteen Gauchos — just before the brand new lights of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium shone on grass that was once the home of Cleveland Indians starting pitcher Shane Bieber, whose rise to the top of the game has since coincided quite nicely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the five seniors UCSB waved off, Kevin Chandler and Alex Patterson were the pitchers. Chandler had already spent his first two years of college ball with the Gauchos before Patterson made the switch from San Joaquin Delta College. They pitched a combined 154.1 innings for UCSB. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outfielders Tevin Mitchell and Michael McAdoo are joined alongside catcher Thomas Rowan as the position players who have left their space for the next wave of exciting talent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell and Rowan are both currently playing for the Gulf Coast League (GCL) Marlins, a rookie-level affiliate of the Miami Marlins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With five seniors gone, that leaves eight, who are all playing professional baseball. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack Dashwood, Eric Yang and Tommy Jew all chose red.Dashwood is with the Angels, Yang is with the Reds and Jew is learning the Cardinal Way, out in a town just blistering with excitement after Jordan Binnington’s masterful run with the Blues for St Louis’ first cup. And they’re known as a baseball town too, so it’ll be nice to see him coming up in a great system with a great fanbase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Martinez, Ben Brecht and Shea Barry make up the rest of our Gauchos who have not only said goodbye to UCSB, but to California (for now at least). Martinez is with the Orioles, facing off against Mitchell and Rowan in the GCL. Ben Brecht is with Tampa Bay, playing in Hudson Valley while Shea Barry brought his ball to Houston. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, the locals. Chris Lincoln got picked up by the new-look San Diego Padres, who seem to have built the perfect farm system years into A.J. Preller’s reign as general manager. They look capable of providing a great network and system for Lincoln to thrive in. Armani Smith drove up the 101 just like he’s done the past two years, a native of Martinez, California. He’s playing for his hometown Giants.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And Shane Bieber’s an all-star! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here we are, past the introduction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season is officially underway as UCSB has since wrapped up a three-game series last Sunday at Sacramento State 2-1, batting a measly .181 over the entire series. They returned home Monday for the debut of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium’s brand new lights. It was the first night game in program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And their bats were sizzling as they rattled off a .447 clip at the plate to give them a 17-7 win over Cal in a one-off series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the break just about done, UCSB will host their first home series of the season as Abilene Christian University comes to town this weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wildcats hosted Utah Valley for a four-game series in which the Wildcats swept them 27-9 overall. They then hit the road for a one-off against TCU in which they lost 4-14. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’ll be an interesting series to say the least. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Friday and Saturday evening games will start at 5:30 p.m. and 4 p.m., respectively. Sunday’s match is set for noon, under what will hopefully be a clear sky after Saturday’s current rain projection. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/new-look-ucsb-baseball-ready-for-first-series-under-new-lights/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/new-look-ucsb-baseball-ready-for-first-series-under-new-lights/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/new-look-ucsb-baseball-ready-for-first-series-under-new-lights/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/new-look-ucsb-baseball-ready-for-first-series-under-new-lights/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/new-look-ucsb-baseball-ready-for-first-series-under-new-lights/","id":4087,"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro"},"related":[4086,4085,4084],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
