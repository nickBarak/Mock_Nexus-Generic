The GSA also plans to use part of its own budget to finalize said renovations, with the total cost estimated to slightly exceed $100,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Space really is a commodity on this campus,” Sorin said. “We were hoping… to reclaim [the lounge] publicly as ours, to demonstrate to the broader UCSB community that [it] is for grad students. We really don’t have anywhere else on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other renovations, the GSA intends to replace all the furniture in the lounge and patio, Sorin said, adding that accessibility for all students was considered, as the current furniture limits flexibility within the space. She said the intent with the new furniture is to make every student feel comfortable and welcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GSA Lounge will be open 24/7, but students will need to check out a keycard from the GSA to open the locked door, according to Sorin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lounge will also be receiving four egg chairs — spherical chairs with an overhead visor — courtesy of UCSB Health and Wellness, which has a budget set aside for graduate students. The chairs will be placed into a new relaxation room, formerly an infrequently used conference room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sorin, the last renovations to the lounge were made prior to Lubach’s appointment as advisor — over 14 years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The lounge is] a real hodgepodge, we couldn’t tell you where any of it came from,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovations began in the middle of August and are planned to be completed by the end of fall quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just excited to get it finished… really we just want grad students to feel like they have a place on campus where they are welcome constantly anytime, day or night, and that they can get support, even if that’s just kicking back on the couch,” Sorin said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/","id":3311,"author":{"id":52,"name":"Manuel Carlos"},"related":[3310,3309,3308],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":52,"name":"Manuel Carlos","biography":"Not available","articles":[3311,5760],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Why France Will Win the Euro 2016","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/uefa-pic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/uefa-pic.jpg?resize=980%2C630&ssl=1","description":"With the 2016 UEFA European Championship beginning yesterday June 10, staff writer Ryan Burns provides an early prediction that concludes with the hometown team winning it all.

France started five players under 23 in the match, and all five were playing in their debut World Cup.</p>\n<p>Since 2014, two of those five have developed into some of the most crucial members of France’s international setup: Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann. In the last two seasons, the trio has combined for two Serie A titles, two Ligue 1 wins, two Champions League final appearances and several domestic cups, making the Les Bleus youthful core some of the most experienced players at the Euro.</p>\n<p>Many experts have even been picking Pogba as an early favorite for player of the tournament, and for good reason as the center midfielder’s special talents propelled his club team Juventus to yet another league title. Whenever the Messi/Ronaldo Ballon d’Or era comes to an end, Pogba is one of the young players who will have an honest chance of getting their hands on the prized individual award, maybe even more than once.</p>\n<p>The best sign for France, however, is that he might not even be the best player in the national team’s midfield. West Ham’s Dimitri Payet, a player who has largely gone under the radar in the weeks leading up to summer’s headline competition, is coming off a truly breathtaking season in his debut Premier League season.</p>\n<p>The former Marseille virtuoso now plies his trade under Slaven Bilic’s West Ham and skyrocketed the perennial mid-table team into one of the most formidable sides in England. Payet’s 116 chances created (according to Squawka) were the second highest in the league, and the creative Frenchman has the ability to hit free kicks on a David Beckham level.</p>\n<p>His winner in the friendly against Cameroon a last month was a perfect example of Payet’s prowess from set pieces, but more importantly, it highlights France’s biggest strength as a team. Didier Deschamps, Les Bleus manager, selected a team that is chalk full of legitimately world-class talent capable of turning a game on its head, and match winners are the most important thing to have in a squad heading into a major tournament with hopes of hoisting the trophy.</p>\n<p>France’s goalkeeper, Hugo Loris (Tottenham) is one of the best shot stoppers in the world and was an unsung hero in his club team’s title run. Kingsley Coman of Bayern Munich came on as a substitute in the Champions League against his former team Juventus and put in one of the most impressive games by a winger in Europe this season, absolutely torturing the Juve defense.</p>\n<p>Down 2-1 in the 91st minute, the French winger sent in an inch-perfect cross that was clinically headed in by Thomas Müller to send the game into extra time. Three minutes after a Thiago Alcantara goal that gave Bayern a 3-2 lead, Coman worked his magic. The winger outpaced the Juventus defense as he dribbled from deep into his own half the length of the field, curling his weak-footed shot past Gianluigi Buffon to seal the tie.</p>\n<p>This French team has the individual talent to make a historic run at the Euro title on home soil — a feat they accomplished in 1984 — as well as a great team spirit about them, led by veterans like Patrice Evra and Laurent Koscielny, while enjoying an injection of top-class youth which has made them the most fearsome force heading into the tournament.</p>\n<p>They have an eye for the spectacular — the flicks and tricks to make the stadium gasp in awe — and if the pieces line up, Les Bleus could be in for a special night in Paris.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

attempts per game, both career highs. While possibly aberrational, Crowder displayed decent form and would benefit from a demotion in the offensive rotation.</p>\n<p>Avery Bradley showed a vastly improved offensive game, scoring a career high 15.2 points per contest with an effective field goal percentage of 52 percent, the best efficiency since his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>Bradley continued the Brad Stevens-induced trend of substituting three point jumpers for what had been long-twos, contributing to his uptick in scoring efficiency. The former Longhorn put forth another superior defensive season, which was highlighted in the Celtics’ two clashes with Golden State in which he starred in his audition as the league’s best Steph Curry defender.</p>\n<p>The development of Thomas, Crowder and Bradley asserted them as the above-average NBA starters. Paired with a rim-protector and another shot-creator, Boston has the beginning of an elite starting lineup. The flaws of one dimensional players such as Marcus Smart and Kelly Olynyk don’t look so glaring when they are relegated to bench roles.</p>\n<p>With free agency rolling around again this summer, the true question is: What additions will the Celtics make?</p>\n<p>The free agency market is ripe with players to fill the Celtics’ needs and the suitors will be beyond plentiful. Where Danny Ainge directs his attention in the early days of July will be fascinating. Without further ado, here are a few suggestions as to who Boston could possibly pursue:</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Position: Center </strong></p>\n<p>Flushed with cap space, the Celtics can afford to target the defensive presence at the rim they’ve sorely missed since the departure of Kevin Garnett. While the Raptors’ center has played himself into a max contract in the series against the Cavaliers, he will be worthy of an overpay to take a good defense built on effort and intelligence to an elite level.</p>\n<p>If the Celtics target the block machine, however, they will need to prioritize scoring and ball-handling on the wing as they will receive a little to no contribution from Bismack Biyombo on that end. Biyombo’s hands are bad, but the staff could help him develop a slightly better lob catch, turning him into a decent rim-runner.</p>\n<p>Though there is uncertainty concerning Biyombo’s age (23), he’s shown nothing to suggest his game will suffer a large drop off over the next four years. A team nestled up against the cap with one big move left would be remiss in putting all their eggs in Biyombo’s basket; a team like the Celtics, though, with several rookie scale and bargain veteran contracts extending through the cap boom, should feel comfortable targeting him.</p>\n<p>Ian Mahinmi is another option for the C’s, possibly at a slightly lower price tag as he is Biyombo’s senior by a decent margin at the age of 29, though he offers less mobility on the perimeter and functions more as a point-blank rim protector.</p>\n<p>Neither Hassan Whiteside nor Dwight Howard seem to fit the Celtics’ faster style of play, and too much uncertainty surrounds Festus Ezeli’s health for Ainge to lure him away from Golden State with a substantial offer. Joakim Noah would be a good fit on the floor, adding the best playmaking and defense Brad Stevens has had at the center spot during his coaching tenure.</p>\n<p>Timofey Mozgov and Donatas Motiejunas are possible reclamation projects, too. Mozgov could still flourish as a force in the lane with four shooters around him, and Motiejunas would allow the Celtics to go five-out for the entire game with Olynyk as his backup. Both players might be available on cheaper contracts after disappointing seasons, but with so much cap space around the league they could be bound for expensive deals that aren’t cost-effective for Boston.</p>\n<p>Miles Plumlee is also a viable option and would be a good target if the Celtics find this crop of centers unappealing compared to 2017 or 2018. The latter class has a great deal of star power at the five, including Derrick Favors, DeMarcus Cousins and Brook Lopez.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Position: Wing</strong></p>\n<p>The Celtics will make a pitch for Kevin Durant, but they can’t realistically offer him a better opportunity to win than the Thunder, making plans B, C and D very important.</p>\n<p>Jared Dudley should be a priority for Boston; they can spend heavily on a one or two year deal or get a bargain on a longer contract. Dudley, turning 31 this summer, should have four years of consistent basketball left in him, though injury concerns make a hefty deal doubtful.</p>\n<p>The Boston College alum would be best served coming off the bench as he is able to replace Crowder and also play alongside him in a smaller unit that could easily switch on defense, especially if paired with Marcus Smart at the shooting guard.</p>\n<p>Marvin Williams is appealing for similar reasons, as the four man offers a reliable three point shot and switching ability as a player who has been a small forward at times in his career. In a contract season, Williams was a top 10 power forward in ESPN’s real plus-minus rating, but whether or not that’s replicable is certainly up in the air. He is passing the age 30 threshold in 2016, making a long team deal his priority. However, he is a questionable proposition for a Celtics team looking to maintain future flexibility.</p>\n<p>From the restricted market, Solomon Hill would be a nice addition as a versatile defender, though the Celtics could use someone with more offensive gravity. Moe Harkless is another option, though the Blazers will be likely to match any offer within reason.</p>\n<p>The most impactful possibilities on the wing are Chandler Parsons, who will exercise his player option and become a free agent, and Nicolas Batum. The Mavericks’ small forward would bring juice to the Celtics offense as his silky shot and ball-handling ability would fit seamlessly with Stevens’ five-out aspirations.</p>\n<p>Batum would fit for similar reasons, though he seems committed to staying in Charlotte and carrying the offensive burden he received in his first year as a Hornet, the most substantial of his career.</p>\n<p>Both will hopefully hear from Ainge, as players of their ilk are to be coveted by every NBA team in 2016. Though there are no star players in this class apart from Durant, adding Parsons or Batum would still vault the Celtics meaningfully higher in the East hierarchy.</p>\n<p>With guards a complete non-priority for Boston, they will be free to focus their spending on the frontcourt while hopefully maintaining enough cap space to bring back Amir Johnson and Jonas Jerebko. Both have guarantee dates of July 3, two days after the free agency moratorium begins, giving the Celtics time to strike before deciding their fate.</p>\n<p>Adding Dudley and Biyombo on one- or two-year expensive contracts — allowing them to return to free agency while there’s an obscene amount of cap space available — would be a sound strategy for both sides. If long-term deals are necessary, both should be valuable enough to prove as trade assets during their first years in Boston, allowing the Celtics to welcome any star player made available for trade with open arms.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/","id":3309,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3308,3307,3306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Witnessing The “King” Prevail","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bron-bron.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bron-bron.jpg?resize=750%2C500&ssl=1","description":"Despite facing a 3-1 deficit, LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers managed to fulfill what no other team in NBA history has ever achieved by winning the series 4-3.

With a player like Bryant who modeled his game after “His Airness” and with James paving his own lane with a form of athleticism and versatility that we had never seen, it’s a debate that will still cause dispute when all is said and done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sunday night marked the end of his 13th</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NBA season, James’ chance to further etch his name as one of the game’s greatest is optimal as much more basketball lies ahead in his career. Whether that extra time entails more championship rings will be most enticing in helping judge the King’s legacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how James’ career ends, I’m sure we can all agree that we have never experienced a player with such a universal effect both on and off the court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the weight of the state of Ohio on his shoulders, James delivered in the most dire time which was reflected with tears at the end of a Game 7 victory; tears of a community, city, state … tears of the witnesses that have waited for so long.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/","id":3310,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3309,3308,3307],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
