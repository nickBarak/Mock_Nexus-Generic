We can say, ‘This experience happened to me. I felt unsafe. Can you explain to me why it happened or can we talk about this to work it through?’” Meijer said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others who joined Meijer included leaders of community and campus groups including Students Against Sexual Assault, the Isla Vista Community Services District, the Black Students Union and Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA-elect for the 2019-2020 school year. Members of the EVPLA office were also present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No law enforcement representatives attended this meeting. Meijer said it was due to the meeting’s preliminary nature in setting up a base and not conducting any official business yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preliminary draft of the agenda for meetings has introductions and guidelines for 10 minutes, public comment for 30 minutes, discussion for 30 minutes, identifying steps for 10 minutes and closed session without police officers for 10 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer based the new Police Collaborative Board’s structure off of an original police collaborative board proposal left behind by 2015-2016 EVPLA Paola Dela Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those present at the meeting suggested edits to the list of potential members of the board, such as law enforcement officers, A.S. entities and property owners. Changes were also made to the sample agenda, along with the goals and structure of meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emphasizing restorative justice and community policing as goals for the board was among the recommended changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara initially had a “Student Safety Panel” headed by former Lieutenant Raymond Vuillemainroy of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), according to the original proposal from Dela Cruz. The purpose of the panel was to create a collaborative relationship with community members and student leaders through open dialogue, but it was dissolved in 2013 when Lt. Vuillemainroy left the IVFP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was substantial debate on whether the presence of police officers was necessary during public comment for future meetings. While safety was considered imperative for community members who cited personal experiences and grievances with police officers, Meijer found it equally important for police officers to be present to listen to safety concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees settled on a compromise: People will be able to speak at meetings or submit written anonymous comments on paper or through a Google Form. People can also choose to comment privately later in the meeting without the presence of police officers in a closed session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A suggestion was made for the addition of a statement at the beginning of meetings stating police officers will not question people regarding their comments unless there is a present danger to others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertising and translating in other languages so that community members of different linguistic backgrounds can voice their concerns was proposed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Meijer is working to have the Police Collaborative Board added to A.S. Legal Code. The board would have to be voted and approved through A.S. Senate, according to Meijer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A finalized version of the proposal will be considered at the next collaborative board meeting on May 29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer hopes to have the structure prepared so the board is ready to begin official business by Fall Quarter 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy, believes the board will be able to foster a better relationship between the community and law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the board’s goal is to make an open line of communication… I think that’s a good thing. Student groups can raise concerns about things that are going on. We can answer those concerns in real-time, real-worded answers,” Schroeder said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

So with that in mind, as long as the students stay Cal Grant- and Pell Grant-eligible while they’re here, then why would we not promise them four years of federal packaging?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the condition that the Promise Scholar students remain </span><a href=\"https://www.csac.ca.gov/post/how-do-i-qualify-cal-grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– and </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pell Grant-eligible</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through their four years of college, they are guaranteed $120,000 in grants and scholarships when they first come to UCSB from the federal, state and institutional level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program requires students to sign contracts agreeing to maintain a 2.75 GPA upon arrival to UCSB, file their taxes on time, complete their FAFSA on time and take a handful of mandatory classes and workshops throughout their time at the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also have to agree to fill out surveys during and after their time at UCSB to help with the “continued funding and success” of the program, according to the program’s </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/promise-scholars-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the financial support, the program provides students with what Roose calls “wraparound services,” which include counseling and one-on-one support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program initially included only monetary aid when it was first started in 2015, but when Roose arrived in June 2016, it grew to include additional services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Mike Miller, who started the program, realized very quickly that you can’t just give low-income, first-generation, underrepresented students money and be like, ‘Here, go to college,’ and expect them to be able to survive,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose worked in the McNair Scholars Program at San Diego State before coming to UCSB, and said she drew from her experience there, particularly with programming, to help build the Promise Scholars Program into what it is today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose operates as a resource for students to go to with any problems and even keeps stacks of business cards for various UCSB entities on her desk so she can easily direct students to the services they need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with a small staff, Roose said it is difficult for her and her two part-time assistants to serve the needs of all 428 students in the program, especially since they have a policy of never turning a student away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose also recently started a mini-Promise Scholars Program with Joe O’Brien, assistant dean of the College of Letters &amp; Science Advising, in the form of INT 10: “Transitioning to Academic Excellence,” a course “to help students get acclimated to the university and to help build them a safety net,” Roose said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Roose runs a Scholar Retention Program, also created by Miller, to allow students who are academically disqualified and lose their financial aid to return during the summer and take classes. If they receive two B’s during their summer classes, they are able to get back into school, Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these various initiatives require more hours, and a larger staff would help Roose maintain these programs, serve the current cohort of Promise Scholars and expand the program to benefit as many students as possible, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once the students are admitted to UCSB, we just cull the most extreme low-income from that group and then we just narrow it down from there based on grades in high school and how promising of a student we think they’re gonna be,” Roose said about the selection process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t have enough money to bring in every low-income student. Otherwise we would.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose believes that college should be free for everybody and hopes the Promise Scholars Program expands to the rest of the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Merced has already picked up this program, and they’ve started offering their students Promise Scholars opportunities,” she said. “And I think Berkeley is considering picking it up. So it would be nice if we could get this program everywhere.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, Roose is taking a minute to celebrate the accomplishments of this first graduating class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have students that were admitted into USC, into Harvard, into Duke, UPenn, Michigan State and UCSB Ph.D. programs and Master’s programs. And then we have some that are going to be going directly into industries,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Roose, the best part of the program is being a part of the journey her students undergo in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s incredible because you just go through everything with them. I’ve met some of their families, I’ve been there for them when their whole world is falling apart, I’ve been there with them when they’ve won amazing awards and it’s just ups and downs all day long,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyna Nguyen, a Promise Scholars student and linguistics major who graduated this past weekend, said that without the program, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I may not have had a college career at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming from a single parent household, there was no way I could’ve afforded an education at UCSB without getting myself into a ridiculous amount of debt,” Nguyen said in an email.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89082\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89082\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89082\" data-attachment-id=\"89082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89082\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=278%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nguyen is part of the first graduating class from the Promise Scholars Program.<em> Courtesy of Lyna Nguyen</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the first graduating class, Nguyen has seen the program grow and take shape as Roose and Miller figured out what worked best for the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last four years, I’ve watched the program grow into stable home for students like me. I say “home” because it truly has become a place where students can find mentors who are like older siblings, staff who care like parents, and friends who understand your at-home life better than anyone else you could find at UCSB,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It started out as a baby program with a handful of students and is now a campus entity with [its] own organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen called the Promise Scholars Program “one of the best things” that has ever happened to her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were brought into college and left to fend for themselves. But when I was at my lowest and drowning, Promise Scholars didn’t abandon me. Quite the opposite; they never left my side. They reached out, and helped me get my life together,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program didn’t just throw money at us and say “here, graduate.” They provided us with skills for the future, and people we can always go back to for help. The Promise Scholars Program helps students like me have a fighting chance in college, and be successful afterwards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen compared the feeling of being part of the first graduating class to the feeling of being the first in one’s family to graduate from college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of pride in being the first group to graduate, because–although this sounds dramatic–I feel like we paved the way for future Promise Scholars.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Salcedo pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, the father of a Berkeley alumunus was charged with </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/13/father-of-uc-berkeley-alumnus-charged-in-college-admission-scandal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allegedly paying a test-taker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to take his son’s SAT test to help him gain admission to the university, as reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Cal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The father pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were no reported instances of backdoor admissions at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June’s audit is the first of two system-wide ECAS investigations into the UC admissions process; the second will be completed by the end of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit report made note of three specific suggestions to strengthen the UC application process: clearer documentation, improved verification protocols and stronger admissions procedures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure clear documentation, the audit suggests maintaining a “clear documentation trail” in order for admissions personnel to arrive at accurate admission decisions. The audit also calls for additional documentation for students applying on the basis of athletics or “special talent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the audit calls for a surveillance of donations and philanthropy to avoid admissions decisions “being made on the basis of expected financial gain to the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure an applicant’s truthfulness, the audit suggests the UC bolster its current vetting techniques to make it more difficult for third parties to frame an applicant’s “special talents” to gain an upper hand in the admissions process. Furthermore, the audit noted a lack of accountability in monitoring a student athlete’s engagement in their respective sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of strengthening procedures, the audit reported a lack of processes in place to manage conflicts of interest in the admissions process and the “reporting structure” of athletics compliance offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit suggests an improvement of these processes to “prevent bad actors from taking advantage of the system in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/current-issues/admissions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that while the UC believes its UC admissions process “works well and has significant and effective controls in place,” the UC “accept[s] all of the ECAS recommendations so we can continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take our zero tolerance policy extremely seriously — even one instance of admissions fraud is one too many,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano also implored each UC chancellor to develop their own “campus-specific” plans and tailor them to the ECAS’ recommendations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a specific plan for the UCSB campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of May, the California State Assembly took initial legislative steps towards improving university admissions processes with </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1383\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 1383</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which would deny any university within the UC system the power to grant students special admittance, or “admission by exception,” unless the admittance is approved by three college administrators. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Oftentimes, Meijer said she found it hard to check every box while also trying to “pass the baton” to the next person taking office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer noted two specific platforms she ran on last year — establishing an emergency housing grant and expanding parking in I.V. — which both progressed throughout her term but ultimately failed to completely flesh out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), Meijer constructed an outline for how an emergency housing grant would work but was not able to make it a reality. In the case of expanded parking, something that “basically every EVPLA has run on,” Meijer and her office were unable to resolve the problem — even after speaking with Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who told her there was little that could be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So when I talked to Joan Hartmann about [parking], she was basically saying the answer from county is that there’s no solution,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, other projects saw more success. Meijer’s term was highlighted by a common theme of community outreach and safety, evident by substantial progress in both areas through multiple projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of addressing sexual assault, Meijer participated in spearheading new sexual assault and survivor policies as well as bystander intervention trainings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Fall Quarter 2018, Meijer began working with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) to help create a foundation for future events and projects throughout the year. Meijer worked with Associated Students (A.S.) On Campus Senator Zion Solomon and SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford to provide funding and support for the SASA Survivor Healing events and bystander intervention trainings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bystander intervention trainings, which later made their way to the A.S. Senate table as a resolution, was created to assist </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newly-appointed Interpersonal Violence Investigator Kovena Avila</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by educating students on “how to report a sexual assault, what the reporting process is, what it looks like and what your rights are,” according to Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer collaborated with law enforcement in other instances as well, such as working to develop a new police collaborative board, a previous campaign platform. By doing so, the collaborative board, which held its first meeting on May 13, will hopefully function to maintain open and “direct communication” between students and law enforcement, according to Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer also hosted separate “eating events” with law enforcement during the year to continue fostering a better relationship between students and police. Meijer says the events — “Coffee with a Cop” and “Pizza with Police” — helped to provide students with information regarding road closures and parking restrictions during special events such as Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a hot-button topic in I.V., saw significant progress through Meijer and her offices’ combined efforts with the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and Lobby Corps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After compiling data collected from a group walk through I.V. Fall Quarter 2018, the I.V. CSD and External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office released a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">street lighting report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which underscored areas where new lights are required and which current lights are in need of upgrades. Meijer says it will take more than “a couple of weeks” for work to begin, likely dragging the street lighting project through Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer also collaborated with the Alcohol and Drug Program to provide </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overdose prevention trainings for students and community members</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. During the training, Meijer said attendees were instructed on how to properly distribute naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose. Although the event took place at a similar time to Deltopia, Meijer said it was actually planned months in advance, at the beginning of Winter Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Meijer is currently working to equip UCSB’s Community Service Officers with naloxone, as the drug is currently limited to local law enforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around Halloween of Fall Quarter 2018, “the EVPLA office and IVTU went to every house in I.V. and brought everyone a tote bag,” Meijer said. Within the tote bag, community members received cards which noted road closures, important phone numbers and relevant resources. The cards were written in both Spanish and English. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before her term ends, Meijer said she has two final events planned as EVPLA: a Beloved Community “common table” and a five-year anniversary of the 2014 shootings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 18, Meijer said community members will have the opportunity to gather at People’s Park for an event sponsored by the Beloved Community Project. The “common table” is similar to a small conference, according to Meijer. She said the “community-bonding” event is strictly about “breaking bread” and mingling with fellow community members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 23, the fifth anniversary of the 2014 I.V. shootings, Meijer hopes to bring back elements from the first anniversary in 2015, when students and community members walked through campus and I.V. and wrote messages on eight different chalkboards in honor of those who lost their lives or were injured. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our plan is to get those chalkboards duplicated… we’re going to have flowers and ask entities to donate bouquets,” Meijer said. After walking past Storke Tower and down Pardall Road, attendees will “stop at Remembrance Garden and leave the flowers on each of the six benches.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a liaison between the university and the surrounding community, Meijer’s involvement with various organizations and initiatives reflect just how many doors she and her office have their feet in — a vital component of the position of EVPLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried my hardest but it was very humbling … hopefully my passion shows in my work and people can tell I was passionate through what I did,” Meijer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Ornelas, a third-year environmental studies major currently serving as an off campus senator, will succeed Meijer for the 2019-2020 school year.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
