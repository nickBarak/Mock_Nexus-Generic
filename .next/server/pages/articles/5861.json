The Paper Towel Free Project provides a select group of residents with reusable cloth hand towels as an alternative to paper towels within the residence hall bathrooms. This project was created in collaboration with UCSB’s Zero Waste Committee, the Residential Hall Association and UCSB’s Housing &amp; Residential Services.</p>\n<p>While we, the co-chairs of the Zero Waste Committee, are open to criticism that is rooted in fact, we are not open to criticism that is based on misinformation and false accusations. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to address some of the claims that the author oh-so-boldly stated.</p>\n<p>First, we’d like to set the record straight on the details of our project: there are currently a little over 200 students from both the Environmental and Black Scholars floors in Santa Rosa, along with the entire Cuyama house at Manzanita, piloting the project. Mr. Yack was misinformed when he claimed that we were solely piloting this project on the Environmental floor. In fact, two out of three of the students sampled are not from environmentally themed floors, a conscious choice that was made in order to create a more diverse pool of participants. Additionally, we’d like to clarify the purpose of our pilot project, which is to provide students with a sustainable alternative to paper towels. While the environmental aspect of our project is undeniable, its economic and social aspects must be acknowledged as well.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A waste audit revealed that Santa Rosa sends about 50,400 gallons of used paper towels to a landfill every year. Considering the fact that there are six other residence halls that use paper towels in their bathrooms, the total volume of paper towels sent to the landfill by Housing is several times higher. UCSB as an institution has committed itself to the UC-wide goal of zero waste by 2020. Obviously, UCSB cannot achieve this goal while sending this volume of paper towels to the landfill. While Mr. Yack believes that this goal is “lofty and unrealistic,” it is only unrealistic if projects such as ours do not get implemented.</p>\n<p>If we have not yet convinced you about the significance of our project, maybe this next fact will: Housing has to spend an average of $43,351 per year on paper towels for the residence halls. On top of this expense, Housing also must pay for custodial services to supply the towels and collect and dispose of used paper towels, and for our waste hauler to take dumpsters full of paper towels to the landfill. These are all costs that could be eliminated immediately if the residence halls became paper towel free. The savings could instead be reallocated to other residence hall projects.</p>\n<p>There are several overlooked benefits that our project offers. First, how many times have you walked into a residence hall bathroom and cringed at the sight of discarded paper towels coating the floor? We have received direct feedback from project participants noting that there is a significant difference in the cleanliness of their bathrooms versus bathrooms that still have paper towels. This aesthetic reward comes with the additional benefit in that custodial staff no longer have to spend time installing, removing, and cleaning up the paper towels. That time can now be spent more efficiently elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Another issue that we would like to touch upon is the sanitation aspect of our project. There is no substantial evidence for a correlation between sickness and hand towel use. Mr. Yack argued that the inconveniences of washing their hand towels will prevent many students from doing so. Students are already responsible for washing their shower towels and sheets – adding a hand towel to this list should not be too inconvenient. Prior to move-in, participants were encouraged to come with extra hand towels so that they wouldn’t need to do laundry as frequently. Despite Mr. Yack’s bold accusation, our project does nothing to discourage personal hygiene.</p>\n<p>Mr. Yack also criticized us for not installing hand dryers or considering composting as an alternative to the project. In fact, last year there was a pilot project in the residence halls that tested the possibility of installing hand dryers within the bathrooms. Unfortunately, they were considered by residents to be too noisy, making them an unsuitable alternative to paper towels. As far as composting, the Zero Waste Committee piloted a project last year in Ellison to test the feasibility of composting used paper towels. After considering the extra labor required combined with the additional cost of compostable trash liners, we determined that this, too, is not a viable alternative.</p>\n<p>With this new information, we hope that Mr. Yack will acknowledge that we extensively explored all of his suggested options before deciding upon reusable hand towels.</p>\n<p>Still not convinced that this project can work successfully? Well then, you should talk to UC Santa Cruz and UC San Diego who are both paper towel free within their residence halls. UCSB considers itself a leader in sustainability, and if we want to maintain this title, we need to adopt projects such as this one, where the benefits greatly outweigh the inconveniences. Gabriela Romo, a first-year student living in Santa Rosa perfectly touched upon this aspect when she wrote: “Although being paper towel free may seem inconvenient at first, students after a while realize that paper towels are in fact an unnecessary and wasteful part of our everyday life.”</p>\n<p>In conclusion, for all of the many reasons stated above, we have no plans of tossing the project any time soon.</p>\n<p><em>Izzy Parnell-Wolfe and Arriana Rabago are the co-chairs of UCSB’s Zero Waste Committee.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Unlike other prequel series, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is brave enough to detach just enough from its enormously successful predecessor, introducing characters unlike that which we’ve seen before and tones that are at times hilarious and genuinely troubling. However, the film relies too much on its pre-established and well-realized setting and lore, losing its grip on executing anything original, fumbling around with its clashing tones and plots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fantastic Beasts” follows magical zoologist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, as he journeys to New York in the 1920s. Upon arrival, Newt immediately loses and unleashes his misunderstood creatures and heads out to find them with unlikely and newly found friends. All the while, a conflict between wizards and the No-Maj (American’s version of the Muggle, those who don’t practice magic) seems to be brewing, as a dark unknown force begins to terrorize Manhattan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of working together, the duel plots of “Fantastic Beasts” are constantly at odds. The first plot, which follows Newt and his friends, is at times charming and hilarious, focusing on the revealing of magical beasts or fantastic locales. Sadly, it never develops its characters and chooses to rely on the setting as a crux for its content. And while the concept of tracking down monsters is a rather fresh and intriguing one, it’s rarely utilized and mostly, disappointingly, absent from the film.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other plot, being far darker, verges on the macabre, and takes itself rather seriously, although it is never given enough time to be anything more than a tease for the eventual climactic reveal. However, some things accomplished during this tone are incredible and disturbing, a welcome risk into darker and controversial territory. The potential conflicts raised here are more compelling than what was seen at Hogwarts, but fortunately for the original series, and unfortunately for the audience, these conflicts are never really explored and are laughably resolved. In the same intensified way, it would have been nice to see the light-hearted moments push farther into the ridiculous and the comedic. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74511\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"68081505\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74494\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74511\" data-attachment-id=\"74511\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/movies-111816-square640/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"movies-111816-square640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74511 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=640%2C640\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Fantastic Beasts” follows magical zoologist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne (left), as he journeys to New York in the 1920s.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two tones work well on their own, but there is not much effort given to bring the two together, resulting in two separate films that are thin in content. In addition, any time spent with each plot is plagued by strange and counterproductive pacing. The film spends too much of its time in unimportant places and rushes right out of where it should be staying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best aspect of the film by far is its production design. From the adorable and inventive creatures, to the stunning magical sets, “Fantastic Beasts” establishes its world flawlessly, engrossing the audience for its entire running time. No doubt benefited by the world already established by the Potter franchise, “Fantastic Beasts” still manages to feel both refreshing and nostalgic. It’s pure bliss. This magical side of New York is just as much as an enjoyable spectacle as Hogwarts was, and with the added 1920s time period there’s a sense of style and maturity that demands to be taken in. The film is fun and makes you feel like you’re a part of the world around you. But while the setting and peacoat costumes may look incredible, the characters that tenant these designs are rather bland and shortchanged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand out performances by Dan Fogler and Colin Farrell do their best to provide the film with enjoyable characters. Fogler, who plays Jacob Kowalski, a hopeful No-Maj baker with his heart on his sleeve, is genuine and hilarious, eliciting a contrasting humor to the forced absurdity of his situation. Farrell, who plays Graves, director of magical security, provides an elusive, dark character that is mysterious in motivation thanks to his complex and seemingly honest presentation. These two easily steal every scene they’re in. The other characters, however, are not so great.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Waterston’s Tina is not only incredibly awkward, but awkwardly performed. Her gawky nature is rarely charming and her character never really clicks. In the same guise, Redmayne’s Newt is also awkward, but manages to provide a quiet and reserved charm. Even so, his quirks are too subtle and are rarely used to make him an interesting character. His lopsided grin and aversion to eye contact begin to mold him into a unique character, but his development stops there. Even with a 133-minute running time, none of these characters are given enough to be fleshed out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A creative, yet thin product, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is torn between far too many things to become anything outstanding in and of itself. It’s visually engaging, but incredibly hollow and directionless. It’s remarkably fun and comical, but by no means memorable. Without the Harry Potter backing, “Fantastic Beasts” could have become another failed attempt at creating a new fantasy franchise. There’s more good than bad to find here, but it’s definitely a personal weighing of pros and cons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters are undeveloped and the plot is barren, yet the ride is exciting, and at times quite a blast. The lack of content can even be overlooked for the film’s spectacular immersion. It’s a mindless blockbuster, but it has just enough quirk and creativity to keep it afloat and overcome most of its problems. Nonetheless, it’s not really about finding fantastic beasts or about anything else for that matter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s far from fantastic, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is by no means “The Phantom Menace,” and if you’re looking for a hollow yet visually stunning, well-produced and fun blockbuster, it is a must.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/","id":5858,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5857,5856,5855],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blowing Smoke at a Smoke and Tobacco Free UCSB","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Second-year political science major Austin Yack questions why the UC smoking ban wasn't put to a student vote.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>As of January 1, 2014, the smoke and tobacco free policy has been implemented on all University of California campuses.</em></p>\n<p>On January 9, 2012 former UC President Mark Yudof wrote a letter to all University of California chancellors asking for their support in making the UC campuses completely smoke and tobacco free within 24 months.

According to freshman Eric Lendrum, “The policy did not take into consideration students’ opinions. There was not even an opinion poll to see if students who pay to attend the university even want a policy like this.” Lendrum does not smoke or chew tobacco, yet his opinion is reflective of a general consensus among students that former President Yudof should have asked their opinions before making such a drastic move.</p>\n<p>Across the nation, the United States has tried to cut back smoking. In Europe, however, it is quite the contrary. Pietro Moro, a student at UCSB, lived in Italy until the age of 17. As he tells, “At my high school in Italy, students were allowed to smoke on campus as long as they were 16.” UCSB boasts about bringing students to the university through foreign exchange programs and educating students that move here from another country as Moro did, yet UC officials don’t take into consideration the needs that these students may have, coming from very different cultures.</p>\n<p>As a smoker, Moro explains, “The policy may not affect me now, but when it comes down to crunch time with midterms and finals, a smoker will always find a way to smoke. I am not sure why they didn’t find a middle ground such as putting in designated smoking areas.”</p>\n<p>Moro’s uncertainties are well-founded and justified. Why didn’t the policy implement designated smoking areas? Designated smoking areas would allow nicotine and tobacco users the freedom to use their product of choice while also reducing second-hand smoke on campus — everybody wins. But apparently allowing designated smoking areas or electronic cigarettes was not drastic enough for the UC system.</p>\n<p>During an interview with senior Ben Abrams, the question of electronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes) was addressed, “As for e-cigarettes and chewing tobacco, I think it is a ridiculous idea that we need to ban something because it is unhealthy for the user alone — by this logic they should also force out the on-campus candy and fast food sales.”</p>\n<p>E-cigarettes and chewing tobacco do not harm anyone but the person using the substance. As Abrams pointed out, this sounds an awful lot like fast food and candy. Yet we still have fast food and candy on campus because these items maximize profit to the university unlike tobacco products. Granted, the degree of harm differs between the two categories, but once the precedent of institutional restriction of self-harm is introduced, it is difficult to say when it has gone too far.</p>\n<p>A general consensus of students seems to agree: We should have a voice on matters like these. Because if the UC President has the authority to create a radical policy like this without any student consent, what policy is next to come?</p>\n<p><em>Austin Yack is a second-year political science major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Off-Campus Senator Arezu Hashemi is glad that the UC system is finally giving proper consideration to Jewish holidays .","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I remember visiting the doctor’s office during the holiday season. As I walked through the office, I noticed that it was decorated with twinkling Christmas lights, a fabulous tree and crafted figurines of the Nativity scene. As I glanced around the room, I spotted a menorah on the desk of the secretary. I pointed out the menorah to my mom, excited that my Jewish religion was actually being acknowledged in some way. When I was younger, I was satisfied that Hanukkah was even recognized at all. But as I grew up, I realized that being acknowledged in passing is not enough.</p>\n<p>Growing up in a predominantly Christian society, I realized that practicing Judaism was something I wanted to emphasize in my life. I felt as though it was even more important for me to observe Jewish holidays and customs since Judaism is not the chief religion of my country.</p>\n<p>I never realized how little opportunity the Jewish student community has in observing its important high holidays, though, until I came to UCSB. Yom Kippur, a holiday of atonement and the holiest day of the year for the Jewish people, falls during the first week of school. Nonetheless, I find it necessary to observe this holiday with my family. Skipping the first few days of school, although a personal decision, has always been a choice that I have made with disdain. This decision, although necessary for my personal beliefs, robs me of the equal chance to exceed in certain classes because by Week Two, I’ll have already missed key announcements, lectures and readings. Thus, I have been forced to choose between my religion and my studies on quite a few occasions. This is why I am extremely grateful to the UC system for deciding to push back the first week of school. Speaking to other Jewish students at UCSB, I can confidently say that as a community, most of us are appreciative for the change in schedule. We wish it had come sooner, but we are enormously thankful that it came at all.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I thought that my peers would admire this change, and that they would be excited to get a somewhat extended summer, even if it meant a shorter Winter Break. So I was absolutely shocked to read and hear some of the negative criticism that my peers expressed regarding the schedule change. I expected the negative sentiments towards the shortened winter break, but I did not expect the anti-Semitism that came along with some of these concerns.</p>\n<p>Facebook was a place where many of these disrespectful sentiments were publicly advertised. Students and non-students alike expressed outraged that the Jewish community was receiving “special treatment” and claimed that Jews were already an overly privileged group, dominating “half of Wall Street, not to mention the media, government, [and] the Nobel Prizes.”</p>\n<p>I am privileged. But, I speak for myself when I say that I am privileged. I am privileged to have a generous, supportive family. I am privileged to be studying at a world-class university. I am privileged to be a part of a religion that speaks to my soul. And I acknowledge these privileges.</p>\n<p>But I also acknowledge that Jewish people as a whole are not privileged. Jews have been historically oppressed and frankly, in this country, historically ignored. I’m not talking in terms of business or media, but rather culturally and religiously. There is an undeniable lack of consideration of the Jewish community when it comes to organizing the scholastic schedule. Winter Break is always centered on Christmas, while Hanukkah is ultimately expendable if it falls outside of the Christmas/New Year area. Also, Passover almost always falls during the school year. Now, finally, the two most important Jewish holidays — Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur — are being recognized. This recognition ultimately shows respect to the Jewish community, which is graciously and gratefully welcomed.</p>\n<p>The general reactions to the schedule change have made the lack of respect for Jews clear on campus. One student expressed disdain for the new schedule by writing a letter to Janet Napolitano and sharing it with the Facebook community. In the letter, Judaism is not explicitly mocked; instead, the author employs a highly passive-aggressive demeanor towards it throughout the entire piece. The author suggests that because one religion’s holiday is being considered when planning the schedule, so should the holidays of other religions. I agree with this one hundred percent. The author goes on to list religious holidays that he believes the UC system should, therefore, accommodate as well. At first, the suggestions are relevant and valid — he names Ramadan and Easter — but as the list goes on, the author names holidays such as “Robert E. Lee’s Birthday … a state holiday in Alabama and two other states”. By comparing the holiest day of the Jewish year with a holiday that the author clearly intends to be seen as comical, the post devalues and ridicules the Jewish community as a whole.</p>\n<p>To read that students feel the Jewish community has been “catered to” upsets and angers me. Being acknowledged by the UC system for the first significant time in several years, the Jewish community is not being “catered to” in any way. “Catered to” suggests a privilege that ignores the masses, when the schedule changes provide quite the opposite. The Jewish minority feels that this consideration of our holidays has been long overdue. Some arguments to this schedule change are relevant and backed with reasonable and valuable support, but I am personally offended when students and non-students alike choose to “blame” the schedule change on Jews when, in reality, it’s about time that the Jewish community was recognized.</p>\n<p><em>Arezu Hashemi is a second-year history major.</em></p>\n<h6>This is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
