Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’Oyo’ Park, Children’s Park and Estero Park are among other proposed locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould explained that electrical boxes have already been installed in the ground at People’s Park by Embarcadero Hall and I.V. Clinic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underground trenches to power two electrical panels have also been constructed that run from two cement access points in the ground.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gould, the electrical panels are scheduled to be installed in April and will allow bands to come and perform at People’s Park without needing to bring in a generator for power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The electrical lines installed will also help bring light to Perfect Park, which is located next to People’s Park, Gould added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding for these new improvements will be coming from Measure O that was on the ballot last May for I.V. voters for the 2017 Santa Barbara County Elections. Lebell said the measure was a response to the expiration of a “consolidated bond” established in 1999 that taxed each bedroom in I.V. an extra $28 a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the bond was paid off, instead of allowing this tax to expire, the IVRPD held a special election in June of 2017 that proposed keeping the tax at the same rate for an additional 10 years, but this time to have the money go toward park improvements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure O gives the IVRPD about $250,000 a year to apply towards park enhancements, Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD is also hoping to install new lighting on the basketball courts at Estero Park, located off of Camino Del Sur. This would “allow community members to play after sunset,” IVRDP Chairman Jacob Lebell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell said the new lighting proposals are “a response to the community’s desire for improvements.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the years, improved lighting has consistently ranked among Isla Vistan’s infrastructural issues that they would most like to see addressed and improved,” Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time, no concrete decisions have been made for expanding lighting, other than what has already been installed in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82051\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

it was changed for the preservation of local wildlife. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD Board convened on Feb. 22 to address comments and concerns from the staff about said dog park and to finalize a location, according to the IVRPD Special Meeting Agenda. The project is proposed to begin in Spring Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Board member Pegeen Soutar, the original proposed location for the park was Anisq’Oyo’ Park, next to I.V. Drip. However there were concerns that the presence of dogs could potentially disrupt the park’s pond and the birds that reside there. Because of this, they decided to move the park to Seuno. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soutar, who was accompanied by her own dog, Honeybear, revealed that both she and Jacob Lebell, the Chairman of the IVRPD board, are leading the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell referred to the park on Sueno as a “fairly nice park, but very underutilized.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the park consists of a big grass field with a children’s play structure and a couple of picnic tables. The IVRPD is currently considering the possibility of transferring the play structure to Children’s Park once the dog park is established, Lebell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovations to the park will be made, including surrounding the perimeter with a fence and possibly a “double-gate” to make it easy for dogs to get in and out. Lebell also expressed the IVRPD’s desire to eventually expand the area out in front of the park to include “more and nicer picnic tables.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to convert one of the parks to a dog park was proposed by Lebell after he took notice of the increased amount of dogs in Isla Vista since students have begun to be allowed to have emotional support animals. He also realized that a number of I.V. residences do not have yards that are equipped for dogs to run in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD has also discussed the possibility of including a drinking fountain for the dogs and structures like a hollowed log for the dogs to play on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell’s vision of the park would eventually include a reduced cost or free dog training classes there in an attempt to create a place where “there could be a more centrally located place for dog information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board will be reaching out to the houses in the neighboring vicinity once the project is underway to let them know the changes that will be occuring. The park would have a curfew, like most dog parks, to ensure that people and their dogs do not utilize it past daytime hours. However, a specific time has not yet been decided on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board currently does not have a definitive timeline for the finalized project. Lebell said the plan may be minorly delayed, depending on how impacted local construction companies are by the recent fires and flooding in the Montecito area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lebell, the park’s main purpose would be to create a place where dog owners could organize together and let their dogs run around freely and socialize.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print
