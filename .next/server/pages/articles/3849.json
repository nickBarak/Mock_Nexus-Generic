The deputies were happy to oblige.</p>\n<p>After stopping the 20-year-old, who was on his way to a large party at 6567 DP, the deputies asked the pugnacious partier to repeat himself.</p>\n<p>But with Isla Vista’s finest in his face, the smack talker suddenly fell silent. Reveling in the irony, the officers goaded the inebriated man, asking him if he were too drunk to realize what he had said.</p>\n<p>“No, I didn’t say anything,” he said, but the deputies were quick to refresh his memory. After some convincing, the man finally admitted to his actions, saying “I’ve had a lot to drink.”</p>\n<p>The cops, however, were not sympathetic and arrested the man for public intoxication. A quick search revealed the man was also carrying a small baggie filled with leafy marijuana, like icing on the cake.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>No Burritos After Two<br>\nFri., March 24, 2:26 a.m. – Deputies working the late shift were put to work when a late-night Bill’s Bus arrived in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as one particularly inebriated man exited the bus, made his away across the adjacent park and unzipped his pants. Unaware he was being watched, the 23-year-old let it flow, dousing the building he was next to in his own pungent smell.</p>\n<p>Even though he hadn’t yet finished spelling his name in urine, the officers spoke up and kindly asked him to stop peeing on the building.</p>\n<p>The aging UCSB student had a retort ready and told the officers it was okay, “because I keep this business going by purchasing burritos from them.”</p>\n<p>Despite his stellar logic, there was one serious problem with his argument: He was peeing on the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic – a distinctly burrito-free establishment.</p>\n<p>This fact notwithstanding, the man finished his business with the wall and then nearly fell over, prompting the deputies to arrest him and transport him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., March 25, 11:48 p.m. – Officers were called to the corner of El Colegio and Los Carnernos Roads after an inebriated man refused to pay for his taxi.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and learned that the 24-year-old owed 60 dollars to the cab driver, who had tried collecting the tab repeatedly without success. However, after talking with the young man – who was sporting a suit and pink tie – the officers determined that he did not have any money to pay the driver.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Los Angeles native appeared to have no idea where he was. When asked where he had been picked up, the ride snatcher said he had left from Isla Vista. Then, when asked where he had wanted to be dropped off, he told the deputies Isla Vista, again.</p>\n<p>As the officers processed his paperwork, the man became increasingly confused, at one point asking the officer where his car was and whether it had been towed. He seemed not to remember any car ride, however, and later refused to pay.</p>\n<p>His reason: The cab driver was not in the country legally. The validity of this statement notwithstanding, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/","id":3849,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3848,3847,3846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Breaking and Undressing\nSun., Jan. 25, 12:37 a.m. - Officers stationed on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by an unidentified male who told them an unknown female had entered his home...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Breaking and Undressing<br>\nSun., Jan. 25, 12:37 a.m. – Officers stationed on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by an unidentified male who told them an unknown female had entered his home at 6614 DP.</p>\n<p>According to the resident, the inebriated woman – whom he had never met before – had entered his house, taken off all her clothing and vomited on the floor of his bathroom. As an afterthought, the man told the officers the sickly squatter was also bleeding from the forehead.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, the deputies followed the man to his house and into the bathroom. There, they found an 18-year old girl sitting atop a pile of her own puke, completely in the nude, blood trickling down from an eyebrow piercing.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the drunken CSU Northridge student if she knew where she was or whose house she was in, but she didn’t have any idea. Furthermore, the puking princess could not tell the deputies where she staying nor where she lived.</p>\n<p>When asked how much alcohol she had consumed, she said five shots and told the officers she was feeling “drunk.” She did not know how she had caused her piercing to bleed, though the deputies suspected a tumble had caused the injury.</p>\n<p>Fearing that the nude Northridger would end up somewhere she would regret, the officers decided to arrest her for public intoxication. After collecting her clothing, the deputies transported the out-of-towner to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., Jan. 31, 10:03 p.m. – Officers on 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were alerted to possible trouble by the sound of a car horn.</p>\n<p>Looking down the street, the deputies spotted a young man staggering down the center of the street, with a yellow taxi right on his heels. The taxi driver was unable to get around the sloppy stroller and, out of frustration, had reverted to repeated use of his horn.</p>\n<p>Despite the ruckus behind him, the inebriated 21-year old refused to step aside. When the officers approached and told the young man to get out of the street, he replied, “Well, you’re walking in the road.”</p>\n<p>The deputies, brushing the failed attempt at argument aside, escorted the man, and the girl that was with him, to the sidewalk. The officers then informed the drunken reveler of the dangers associated with walking down the middle of the street and told him to head straight home. His female counterpart, who the officers learned was his girlfriend, ensured the deputies he would do so and they walked off in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, less than a minute later an argument ensued and the officers watched as the childlike 21-year old pulled away from his girlfriend, shouting that he wasn’t going to go home.</p>\n<p>Having escaped the grasp of his woman, the young man fell right into the hands of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who arrested him for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Wild Alaska<br>\nSun., Feb. 1, 2:05 a.m. – A young woman walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive – swaying as she went – caught the eye of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the clearly intoxicated female stumbled down the center of the street, cell phone in hand. The 19-year old then made for the sidewalk, but when she attempted to step up onto the curb, her foot got caught on the curb and she face-planted onto the cement. The deputies then watched as she sat up and promptly returned to her phone conversation.</p>\n<p>   The officers approached the sidewalk sitter and asked her if she knew where she was. She replied she was either in Las Vegas or Alaska, but could not decide which.</p>\n<p>Somewhat befuddled, the deputies asked if there was anyone she could call to come and get her, and the inebriated UCSB student was quick to dial a number. Explaining it was her brother, and that he would take care of her, she handed the phone to the officer, who introduced himself.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the line, the brother informed the officer that he could not come and get his sister since he was in his home state of Alaska.</p>\n<p>With no other option, the deputies arrested the severely misplaced women and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, however, the Las Vegas native vomited in the back seat of the car. Once out of the car, she fell over, hit her head, and temporarily lost consciousness.</p>\n<p>A nurse attended to the fallen reveler and determined she was too drunk to spend the night in jail and the young woman was subsequently transported to the hospital.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18233\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18233\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-04/police-blotter-35/","id":3846,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3845,3844,3843],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 8, 1:55 a.m. - Officers working the red-eye were called to action when they spotted an inebriated man struggling to walk down the 800 block of Camino del Sur.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>23 Flavors<br>\nSun., Feb. 8, 1:55 a.m. – Officers working the red-eye were called to action when they spotted an inebriated man struggling to walk down the 800 block of Camino del Sur.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the young man, who was carrying a half-full Dr. Pepper bottle, and asked him how he was doing. The out-of-towner quickly put a halt to his swaying saunter and mumbled something incoherent in response.</p>\n<p>The lack of a comprehensible reply was enough of an answer for the officers and they proceeded to ask the 19-year-old what he was drinking. This time the officers didn’t get any response, and instead the young man hung his head low and stared at the street while snot dripped down from his nose.</p>\n<p>At one point, however, the late-night reveler attempted to look up at the officers, but the movement was too much for his alcohol-laden body and he nearly toppled over from a lack of balance.</p>\n<p>With the prospect of constructive conversation out of the question, the officers asked to smell the contents of the bottle. Without saying a word, the young man handed it over and the deputies quickly determined that the beverage was not just Dr. Pepper but an intoxicating cousin of the good doctor.</p>\n<p>Suspecting that the underage partier may have more than a spiked Dr. Pepper on his person, the officers asked the busted whippersnapper if they could check his pockets, which he unfortunately agreed to. A quick frisk later, the officers discovered two pill bottles filled with marijuana and another small box with additional herb and a small white pill, later identified as Xanax.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the sloppy stoner didn’t have a prescription for the pot or the Xanax and was arrested for public intoxication as well as possession of a controlled substance. He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Witch Made Me Do It<br>\nThurs., Feb. 5, 1:59 a.m. – Deputies rounding the Embarcadero loop early Thursday morning suddenly found themselves in a Technicolor adventure, Isla Vista style.</p>\n<p>There, in front of the Isla Vista Medical Center, was a yellow brick road of sorts. Only instead of bricks, the path consisted of urine-stained cement. With the musk of human waste in the air, Isla Vista’s finest were off.</p>\n<p>Following the sodden trail to its headwaters, the deputies discovered the source: an intoxicated transient asleep at the door of the medical center. Only there was no man behind the curtain; what they saw was what they got, and the officers quickly determined the river of human piss was coming from the pants of the sleeping squatter.</p>\n<p>Since “camping” on a public sidewalk is illegal, the deputies awoke the passed-out pisser and told him to stand up. The 47-year-old did as he was told, but had to rely heavily on the support of the door to maintain his balance.</p>\n<p>The deputies noted that his pants were soaked in his own bodily fluids, yet nonetheless searched the man – with his consent – for any drugs or weapons.</p>\n<p>Having failed to produce any contraband, the officers arrested the trespassing transient for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The University of Santa California, Barbara<br>\nSat., Feb. 7, 12:34 a.m. – Officers braving a cold and wet Isla Vista night spotted a young male snooping around a fenced yard and decided to investigate.</p>\n<p>The UCSB student was staggering around a fence on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Rd., clearly intoxicated. So unsure was his footing that he had to resort to crouching by the fence to keep from falling over.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the sloppy squatter and asked him if he was all right. Caught off guard, the 20-year-old turned to walk towards the officers but instead slipped and ate it.</p>\n<p>Now on the ground, the intoxicated man assured the officers that he was fine and that he was simply waiting for a friend to arrive.</p>\n<p>The deputy reached down and gave the fallen soldier a hand getting to his feet, and kept his arm there in case his balance gave out a second time.</p>\n<p>The officers then proceeded to ask the standard array of questions – name, address, age – but when they got to his school, the drunken student had some problems. “U-S-C-B,” was his first attempt, quickly followed by “U-C-B-S.”</p>\n<p>With all the evidence they needed, the deputies arrested the tipsy, tongue-tied traveler for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-11/police-blotter-36/","id":3847,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3846,3845,3844],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The City of Love?<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 10:20 p.m. – Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.</p>\n<p>Deputies working the Valentine’s Day shift were pulled away from their romantic dreams when a clearly intoxicated individual stumbled out of the apartment complex at 6653 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>The 18-year-old – who was, not surprisingly, alone and completely hammered – was having a difficult time navigating the parking lot. The officers watched as he stumbled into a parked car, then into a filthy dumpster, back into another parked car and finally out onto the street. There, the pinball wizard continued to run into cars, nearly eating it with every step.</p>\n<p>Stepping in, the deputies contacted the lonely partier and escorted him to the curb. There they tried to talk to the young man, who was not from Isla Vista, but quickly ran into a hurdle: the man could barely speak English.</p>\n<p>Slightly aghast that he was alone on Valentine’s Day, the officers ascertained that the severely drunk man was French. Lucky for them, a random passerby happened to speak the lovely language and started to translate for the deputies.</p>\n<p>The conservation was cut short, however, when the f’ed-up Frenchman leaned over and started to vomit profusely on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the officers arrested the lover-less lover-boy and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Under Intoxicated<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 12:40 a.m. – A man carrying a full glass of amber-colored liquid stepped out onto the 6700 block of Trigo Road and into the sights of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>Having broken a cardinal rule of drinking in I.V., the inebriated individual made an easy target for the Foot Patrol, who quickly approached him and inquired into the glass’ contents.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the 22-year-old turned and started to pour the beverage onto the ground. Unfortunately for him, he was not quick enough and the officer reached out and grabbed the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked the visiting Burbank resident what was in the glass, and he claimed he didn’t know. Taking him for a liar, the officers then asked if it was beer or hard alcohol, and, with his back to the corner, he said, “Probably beer.”</p>\n<p>Having solved the beverage issue, the deputies then noticed that the man’s shirt was torn from the neckline down, and that his bare, hairless chest was exposed for all to see. The deputies, relying on their deft deduction skills, asked if he had been in a fight and he nodded in agreement, but refused to say with whom.</p>\n<p>Moving on, the officers asked the out-of-towner how much he had had to drink, to which he replied, “Honestly, too much.” Taking that as their cue, they arrested the intoxicated reveler. With the cuffs on, they asked if he knew why he had been arrested and he answered, matter-of-factly, “Because I am under intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>The deputies then proceeded to escort the man to the station, during which time the -year-old looked down at his shirt, and with a puzzled look, asked how it got torn. The officers told him it was that way when they found him, but he said he didn’t believe them.</p>\n<p>The officers didn’t really mind though, because shortly after he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/","id":3848,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3847,3846,3845],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
