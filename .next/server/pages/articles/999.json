Throughout this past week’s It’s On Us Week of Action campaign, students signed pledges and wore buttons to demonstrate their support. <br><em>Photo courtesy of UCSB CARE Twitter account @ucsbcare </em></p></div>\n<p>Campus Advocacy for Resources and Education (CARE) led a rally Friday as part of the national It’s On Us initiative, a campaign led by President Barack Obama’s administration to prevent sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>The rally marked the end of the It’s On Us Week of Action, which ended this past Friday, during which students signed pledges and wore buttons to demonstrate their support for the campaign. Student a-cappella group InterVals opened the rally with a performance, followed by speeches by CARE staff members Hannah Brown and Emily Potter on the social complexities of sexual violence and how the university can take action to prevent sexual abuse. They were joined by co-chair of Take Back the Night Gema Hernandez, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming and California Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson staff member Liora Goodman.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Hannah Brown, a CARE staff member and one of the main organizers of the event, said she wants the campaign to inform students about what CARE can do for those who have been sexually assaulted or for those who know someone who has been a victim of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Our main message for survivors is that we want to create an environment that’s accepting and not shameful,” Brown said. “We want survivors to know that they aren’t alone and we are here to support them. As for people who aren’t survivors – if you see something we hope you will step in and protect your friends and people you see on the street.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year sociology major and event organizer Emily Potter, the university officially registered with the It’s On Us campaign last month and said while the CARE program has been addressing college sexual assault for years, the issue itself is getting more substantial attention nationally.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been trying to raise awareness of the issues surrounding sexual assault for years and I think it’s finally, nationally, getting the attention it deserves,” Potter said. “Nothing groundbreaking, but it’s picking up.”</p>\n<p>Potter said people have a difficult time believing victims of sexual assault, which leaves victims feeling insecure and unsupported.</p>\n<p>“I was raped when I was 15,” Potter said. “The first person I told said to me ‘Don’t even pull that shit on me when you admit that you had sex.’ That was when the seed of doubt was planted in me.”</p>\n<p>Brown said she believes the event was a success considering the large participation CARE saw throughout the week.</p>\n<p>“I think people are standing up and saying ‘Hey, this is something I really want to support,’” Brown said. “Especially because we’ve been doing our pledge drive this week and tons of people – hundreds of people – have come in and signed our pledge. It’s really great to see the support from all the students once they’ve seen what the issue is.”</p>\n<p>According to Potter, who opened her speech with the It’s On Us pledge, the campaign is important in light of the lack of support society gives survivors.</p>\n<p>“I pledge to create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported,” Potter said. “Currently we do not have that environment. For some reason, we seem to find it easier to believe the perpetrator over the survivor.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film major Timmy Linetsky attended the It’s On Us rally and said he was proud of the speakers and campaign organizers for sharing their stories and advice.</p>\n<p>“I thought some of the stories people shared were really brave,” Linetsky said. “My best friend gave a speech today and I thought that was incredible.”</p>\n<p><em>[<strong>CORRECTION</strong>: A previous version of this article switched Emily Potter and Hannah Brown’s quotes, attributing Brown’s quotes to Potter’s and Potter’s quotes to Brown.

Soon enough next season will be here, and a new class of rookies will be eager to take the league by storm. This draft class has been labeled as loaded from the lottery to the second round and it will be fascinating to see if it lives up to the hype. Here are my thoughts on some of the draft’s important selections and storylines.</p>\n<p><strong>Rookie of the Year:</strong> Marvin Bagley</p>\n<p>Even with the number two pick in the draft this year, the Kings will still probably find themselves near the bottom of the western conference standings again while they continue to develop their young talent. With that being said, Marvin Bagley will surely be looked to as the Kings go-to scorer and he’ll have many opportunities to put up big numbers. The Kings will be facing no pressure to win games this season which will allow Bagley to play freely and take his lumps while adjusting to the NBA game. With a brand new focal point of their offense, the Kings will hopefully begin to develop some sort of identity moving forward with their collection of promising young players. If Bagley took home Rookie of the Year honors that would be a step in the right direction for their franchise.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Luka Doncic</p>\n<p>Doncic’s stats will most likely be less impressive than Bagley’s, but if he and the Mavs are able to improve enough to squeak into the playoffs, his efforts just might be rewarded handsomely.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Value Pick: </strong>Robert Williams</p>\n<p>Robert Williams, out of Texas A&amp;M, was projected by some to go as high as the late lottery due to his size and athleticism but concerns about his work ethic and off-court problems caused him to fall into the late first round on draft night. So, when the Celtics swiped him up at 27 it was considered a steal and a low-risk pick for that late in the round. Williams is potentially a great fit for Boston, a team that has proven to be great defensively and could easily insert him into a backup center role behind Al Horford. They have enough offensive tools that he will only have to worry about playing defense, running the floor, and catching lobs, all of which he currently excels at. Coach Brad Stevens has been noted for his ability to work with headcases and turn them into productive players, and he will more than likely turn the physical tools of Williams into production for Boston.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Michael Porter Jr.</p>\n<p>His injuries are a massive question mark, but if Porter can live up to his potential, he could prove to be the piece that launches Denver from fringe-playoff team to contender.</p>\n<p><strong>Riskiest Pick: </strong>Trae Young</p>\n<p>Trae Young undoubtedly put up a historic season last year at Oklahoma, leading the county in both points and assists as a freshman. This being said, he did struggle in the latter half of the season when teams game-planned for him and took him out of his rhythm. Young is small in stature and it is possible that he struggles initially with the physicality of the NBA. Also, the fact that the Hawks had Luka Doncic and swapped him for Young on draft night puts some added pressure on him. Hawks fans better hope that Young lives up to expectations because if Doncic shines and Young disappoints, that draft night trade will haunt their franchise forever.</p>\n<p><em>Runner up:</em> Mo Bamba</p>\n<p>Orlando currently lacks any promising playmakers on offense so adding another defensive big with players like Collin Sexton and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander left on the board could prove costly going into the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Second Round Pick: </strong>Keita Bates Diop</p>\n<p>Bates-Diop was projected to go as high as mid-first round in many mock drafts, so it was very surprising when Minnesota was able to scoop him up with the 48th pick. KBD has all of the tools to be an effective NBA player such as defensive length, shooting ability, and experience from four years of college ball. This is an extremely low-risk pick for the T Wolves this late in the draft because he has the ability to come in and contribute right away for a team looking to return to the playoffs. Bates-Diop could also serve as a possible Andrew Wiggins replacement if the Wolves go in and seek out a deal to unload the massive contract of Wiggins, who many say does not have a good relationship with the Minnesota front office.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Jevon Carter</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies roster last year was a nightly who’s-who of former G-League and overseas players, so Carter is likely to get a decent number of minutes backing up Mike Conley.  Plus, I could not think of a better player to fit in with Memphis’s “Grit and Grind” style of play than the defensive-minded Carter.</p>\n<p><strong>Best under the radar pick: </strong>Omari Spellman</p>\n<p>Omari Spellman is probably not a well-known name to casual basketball fans because he was overshadowed by his great teammates at Villanova last year. Recognition aside, Spellman is built out of a Draymond Green-type mold and could find success early on in his career because of this. He is a proven rebounder and defender with the skill to knock down the three-ball at an efficient clip (43% in college).

It took only eight games into Pasternack’s first season for the team to notch the same win total, but that was just the beginning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, one summer later, the Gauchos are looking to build off their refreshing 23-9 season that saw the breakout performance of guard Max Heidegger and a revitalization of the Thunderdome.

While King II, who averaged a double-double of 15.6 points and 10.2 boards per contest, won’t be on the court with the Gauchos this season, his production demonstrates the immediate impact that recruited transfers can have for a team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be especially important for UCSB. Despite losing four senior starters and seven seniors in total, Pasternack has brought in another talented class of recruits, highlighted by game-ready transfers capable of keeping Santa Barbara’s momentum alive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had the biggest turnaround in NCAA history last year from six wins to 23 wins, and a big part of that is the students,” Pasternack continued. “When I first got here April 4, 2017, I said I wanted to build this program where everyone in the community of Santa Barbara and, most importantly, the students would make this their home court advantage.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger’s lights-out shooting will surely bring fans to their feet again this season, filling the Thunderdome with new life. Home court advantage was real for the Gauchos last season, as they won 11 straight at the Thunderdome to start the season and ended 12-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Pasternack hopes to see the same kind of energy at home this season and will likely be putting together more enticing giveaways closer to the start of the regular season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Towards the end of the year, whether it was Irvine at home or the last game of the year, specifically Cal Poly, there was nothing like it; the energy and excitement in the Thunderdome was unbelievable. It was definitely a sixth man for us and I can’t tell you how important that is for our players to have the Thunderdome packed every night no matter who we’re playing. For our program, that’s our goal: to fill the Thunderdome each night,” said Pasternack. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no substitute for a packed Thunderdome when the Gauchos hit a three in transition, so it says a lot for Pasternack and his staff to be so invested in the students and fans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While another 17-win jump is simply impossible, the culture of the Thunderdome is back. And with momentum from last year’s success, the Gauchos are prepared for another remarkable season.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83888\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83888\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/","id":997,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[996,995,994],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Athlete Spotlight: Sophomore Guard Devearl Ramsey","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Devearl-Ramsey-edit.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Devearl-Ramsey-edit.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Max Kelton explores the long-awaited potential of 2-time gold medalist point guard Devearl Ramsey.

The sophomore guard spent last year on the sidelines nursing a stress fracture as a redshirt after he made the move from the University of Nevada to Santa Barbara.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year I tried to watch what the guys were doing and see where I could fit in, how I could make my impact,” Ramsey recalled about his transition. “When I was [recruited] here, Coach P. talked to me a lot about how the offense ran … coming out to play with these guys, we all feel like we have a chip on our shoulders and we all just want to be the best.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramsey headlines a myriad of Gaucho transfers this season, including graduate Alabama guard Ar’mond Davis and former Oregon State point guard JaQuori McLaughlin. Coach Joe Pasternack, now on his second season with the team, has made a significant shift in the program’s recruiting tactics with a greater emphasis on bringing in transfer students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Pasternack took over after the 2016-17 season, only one player on the roster was a transfer recruit while the rest of the team was noticeably young. Pasternack rostered three transfers in his first year, all of whom played a significant role in the 16-win turnaround season following an abysmal 2016. Now in Pasternack’s second year, the Gauchos sport five transfer athletes on their roster, which is now composed of an abundance of experienced veteran players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He really just wants the best from you; he’s really detailed oriented,” Ramsey said with a grin. “[Pasternack] has some of the qualities that the USA coaches had … I feel like he’s getting the best out of all of us and he’s doing a great job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devearl Ramsey is no stranger to successful basketball programs. Ramsey played high school ball at Sierra Canyon located in Los Angeles, Calif., ranking No. 5 in California and No. 21 nationwide in his final year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his sophomore and junior seasons, the point guard was a gold medalist. Ramsey won the FIBA Under-17 World Cup while playing on the same team as Jayson Tatum, Marvin Bagley III and Josh Jackson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People like that, they always work hard. They make you want to get in the gym, too; you guys push each other,” Ramsey said. “It’s been great working out with Marvin, he works out with my brother … I’ve been in the gym with a lot of guys like that; it’s good to go at each other.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Battling back from an injury last season, Devearl zoned in on what aspects of his game could develop with his time off. His older brother Earl works as a trainer in Los Angeles, and together they made significant strides forward during his redshirt year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My brother is like my right hand … he’s the reason I went and started playing basketball. He’s been with me every step of the way,” Ramsey expressed about his recent training focus. “Once I started being able to play, I began working on my jump shot … I feel like I’ve really improved my jump shot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into his first season as a Gaucho, the sophomore has high expectations for the offense under Coach Pasternack. His transition has been somewhat seamless, and now that the point guard is at 100 percent physically, UCSB will run its high-powered attack through Devearl Ramsey. Expect to hear Ramsey’s voice commanding the floor come game time — it’ll be the loudest noise on the court.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A version of this story appeared on page 6 in the Oct. 11 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"text-indent: 12.25pt; line-height: normal; text-align: left;\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/athlete-spotlight-sophomore-guard-devearl-ramsey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/athlete-spotlight-sophomore-guard-devearl-ramsey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/athlete-spotlight-sophomore-guard-devearl-ramsey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/athlete-spotlight-sophomore-guard-devearl-ramsey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/athlete-spotlight-sophomore-guard-devearl-ramsey/","id":998,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[997,996,995],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
