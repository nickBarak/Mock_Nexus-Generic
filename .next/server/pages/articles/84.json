Dubavets and Stojic also went undefeated during the Gauchos BWC title run just a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>The Jayhawks had a tough time during the Big 12 championships, defeating No. 40 Baylor 4-2 in the second round of the conference tournament. In the semifinals, however, Kansas was swept by eventual Big 12 champion No. 12 Oklahoma State. Despite falling short in the semis, Kansas still managed to clinch a No. 2 seed in this year’s NCAAs.</p>\n<p>Set for a fresh sleight after earning its first NCAA Tournament bid in 17 years and led by Head Coach Todd Chapman, who was recently named the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s (ITA) Central Region Coach of the Year on Tuesday, Kansas’ program is revitalized with youthful talent that could potentially achieve an opening round upset.</p>\n<p>Kansas’s standout freshman and the school’s first ever ITA Central Region Freshman of the Year is Anastasiya Rychagova. The young Russian from Moscow is currently ranked 77th in the ITA singles rankings after ending the season with a 15-5 singles and 28-6 doubles record.</p>\n<p>Rychagova has yet to play against other nationally ranked opposition, but that does not mean she has played easy competition. The true freshman has gone to the third set on seven different occasions this season and has gone 3-4 when forced to play three. Rychagova has come into the program without losing a step under Chapman in his third year at the helm.</p>\n<p>Chapman has elevated the program back to the success it has seen in years past, earning an NCAA berth for the first time since 1999, and it was the first time since 2002 that the Jayhawks moved on to the Big 12 semifinals.</p>\n<p>Both teams have the element of a good coach in common with each other. With Head Coach Simon Thibodeau at the forefront of the Santa Barbara program, the Gauchos have not only earned a spot at the NCAAs, but have also claimed a Big West Conference title along the way.</p>\n<p>The Jayhawks and the Gauchos will play this Friday, May 13 at Cal’s Hellman Tennis Complex at 10 a.m. The winner will advance to the next round and face the winner of No. 1 Cal versus the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70878\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70878\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-return-to-ncaa-postseason-take-on-jayhawks/","id":84,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[83,82,81],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas","biography":"Not available","articles":[82,83,84,89,97,99,100,102,104,112,117,118,119,1014,1048,1051,1052,1074,1085,1087,1090,1105,1108,1109,3300],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Wins Final Home Match Of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos improve to 6-1 in conference after another win.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 50 UC Santa Barbara Men’s Tennis team celebrated its Senior Day this past Friday in its last home match with a big 6-1 win over Big West Conference opponent, UC Davis.

During that time the Gauchos were riding the momentum of a five year championship dynasty spearheaded by coach Chris Russell from 1991-1995.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This past weekend however, Santa Barbara took the first step needed to have another string of championships that this program has not had since the nineties.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Winning the first title in 20 for UCSB feels amazing, especially coming here and doing it from the first year, it is a wonderful feeling to be in the program,” Dubavets, the first year gaucho, said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB earned its seventh Big West title in school history after defeating the Aggies of UC Davis, CSU Northridge, and Hawaii.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The championship run began with a quick sweep of the seventh seeded UC Davis on Friday morning.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No.21 sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic made easy work of senior Tiffany Pham and junior Alex Huie by beating them 6-1 on court one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomores Lou Adler and fellow gaucho Amanda Atanasson swept their opponents 6-0 and clinched the doubles point for UCSB.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After establishing a one point lead the Gauchos went on to win the next three singles matches to close out the contest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Palina Dubavets beat sophomore Kristy Jorgensen in two sets 6-0 &amp; 6-1. Junior Jaimee Gilbertson and sophomore Natalie Da Silveira won their matches in consecutive sets as well.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The following day Santa Barbara faced off against CSUN and extended its win streak to seven by defeating the Matadors 4-1.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the Gauchos continued breezed through the first two rounds, Hawaii was upsetting last years’ Big West champion LBSU in a close 4-3 win.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Long Beach was heavily favored and expected to meet UCSB at the finals for a rematch of the last years conference finals matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We expected to play with Long Beach in the final, but we did not forget that Hawaii brought us a lot of problems a few months ago when we played against them, so it was also expectable.” Dubavets explained.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, thanks to freshman Marina Hruba and junior Cindy Nguyen on courts one and two, and the rest of the Rainbow Wahine they managed to earn themselves a ticket to the finals.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Saturday morning at the Indian Well Tennis Garden, Santa Barbara swept Hawaii 4-0 in a closely contested match, despite what the score may have indicated. Yet the Gauchos would not be denied a title after a long season of narrow defeats.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic wrapped up their undefeated weekend by putting six past senior Paulina Petriskova and sophomore Klara Pribylova.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On court two Hawaii won a set of its own 6-3 by beating junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All eyes were on court three as Atanasson and Adler engaged in a back and forth contest against senior Sarah Gealer and freshman Marina Hruba in order to clinch the doubles point and establish a crucial lead.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Earlier in the season during their first encounter, Adler and Atanasson fell to a different combination of Rainbow Warriors but after a series of close exchanges the young gauchos found redemption by winning the set 6-4, and the opening point.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB continued the onslaught and went on to win the next three singles matches. Excluding Da Silveira’s dominant singles performance against Petriskova all the matches were decided by two points.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The UCSB women’s tennis team has earned a bid to the NCAA championships following their conference victory and its first round opponent will be revealed Tuesday, May 3rd which will be streamed at <em>NCAA.com</em>. Its first round match-up will take place on May 13.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-claims-first-big-west-title-in-twenty-years/","id":82,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[81,80,79],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Greatness Comes in Pairs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2193.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2193.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Looking to take each of their playing careers to a higher level, the UCSB women's tennis team's transfer athletes in Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic have brought a refreshing element to the Gauchos...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time and time again we are told that hard work pays off, to keep our nose on the grindstone and to continue to move forward.

At only 19 and 21, respectively, the duo has already experienced much more than many of us hope to, traveling to parts of the world many of us might never see all thanks to a sport that has now brought them stateside. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tennis, much like many other sports, requires a passion, dedication and vision to compete at a high level. For these two, competing at a high level is nothing new, and playing at a Division I NCAA level is just another accolade, another bullet point on their highly impressive resumes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For these emerging tennis stars, playing the sport of tennis began around the same age most of us were first learning our arithmetic or how to tie our shoes. Even as children, Dubavets and Stojic knew that delivering a potent serve or a strong swing would be more than just a pastime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dubavets, originally from Minsk, Belarus, began playing tennis at the age of seven. A few short years later, she realized what the sport could possibly mean for her and her family.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Tennis became the goal for me when I was around 10, then at 12 my parents moved to another city because of tennis, so it became really serious for me. It was taking up a lot of time,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With her family rallying behind her, Dubavets did not take long to prove that their sacrifices would not be in vain. She was selected to represent her native country of Belarus in the 2011 Junior European Championships, and to this day, it continues to be one of the most memorable moments of her tennis career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her first time around, she made it to the third round in singles before eventually falling to current professional tennis player Viktoriya Tomova from Bulgaria. In doubles, it was a similar story as she lost to a Ukraine native in the third round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following year, Dubavets and her partner, Iryna Shymanovich, made it to the semifinals of the same tournament. However, thanks to her persistence, and with the help of her fellow compatriots, Belarus reached a world stage by qualifying for a world tournament for the first time in nearly 20 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, despite what she was able to provide for her country, she did not receive the backing of her federation to the degree others were.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It came to a point around 16 years old when there was trouble with money and the federation was helping only the best of the best,”Dubavets explained. “That made it hard to make it to a lot of the tournaments, so that’s when I decided to go to college.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new target was set in between her sights, and after a couple of goodbyes were exchanged,Dubavets took a risk and found herself surrounded by new people in a new country playing the same game she has always known.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was brought to Texas Christian University’s team, a program that was ranked No. 17 in the nation at the time, by first-year Coach Lee Taylor Walker and Assistant Coach Ben Stapp.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dubavets’ time was brief, but she still managed to play in a total of 60 matches in her first year in both singles and doubles play. In singles, she recorded a 17-10 overall record along with recording a 19-14 doubles record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After just one year at TCU, Palina decided it would be in her best interest to look for a fresh start out West. Her search for a new place to call home came to a close once she became acquainted with UCSB’s elite coaching staff, stellar academics and sunny California weather.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Two main reasons to come here: the coaches and academics. I had to be really sure that the coaches were really good because they take a lot of time from your life, so I had to make sure there was a good chemistry,”Dubavets said. “Academics are definitely a lot better here at UCSB than TCU, and the location and climate is really good for tennis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Able to complete the transfer process and be welcomed to the UCSB women’s tennis program with open arms, Dubavets became another international asset to Santa Barbara’s program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering UCSB with similar intentions of a fresh start, Australia native Stojic was determined to contribute to the Gauchos’ recruiting progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stojic picked up the tennis racket at an early age and has yet to put it down. Since then, she has made quite an impact in the tennis community by creating an extensive resume of her own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I started when I was seven. It got pretty serious, and then from there it was just playing under Australia and representing Australia through all those International Tennis Federation and junior tournaments,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After years of training, her junior career culminated during the 2011 Australian Open whenStojic faced some of today’s tennis stars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the main draw of the girl singles competition, she was pitted against Klara Fabikova from the Czech Republic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Fabikova plays for the Golden Bears of Cal and is ranked No. 12 in the nation according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. Stefani managed to demonstrate what she is capable of by defeating a young Fabikova 6-3 in two consecutive sets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following round, Stojic competed against Monica Puig who is currently ranked top 40 in the world in the pro circuit, and the experience that Stefani had with her is something she has yet to forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After participating in junior competitions, Stojic, like her fellow Gaucho transfer teammate Dubavets, made a decision to go to college because of the financial hardships that come with participating in tournaments at an elite level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So instead of going pro right after high school, she decided to pursue tennis at one of the best tennis programs in the country, the University of Florida, is currently ranked third in the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I didn’t know I was going to go to college,” Stojic said. “I thought I was going to jump into professional tennis, but financially it was too hard to travel. So, I came to college looking to get better and get a degree.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like most professional athletes can attest to, the journey is not a simple one, it is a process of stumbling and overcoming any obstacles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two years of being underutilized at the University of Florida, Stojic decided to take her talents to Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t get to play much, and we had a really strong team at the University of Florida,” Stojic explained. “We had eight players and it was always hard to get into the lineup. I personally want to go pro after college, so for me, it was important to get a load of matches and playing so I can go pro. So I was trying to find a school that I knew I would be playing top in line and get good quality matches every week consistently.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing time and opportunity have definitely been afforded to both Stojic and Dubavets here at UCSB. Regardless of all the chances that might be offered, it is up to the athlete to ensure that their production equals or even surpasses expectation in order to ensure a spot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two definitely have not disappointed as they have helped the Gauchos amass their season-high national ranking of No. 65 earlier in the season. They have been an important staple for UCSB’s young roster as the two are currently the team’s leaders in wins in singles and doubles at the one slot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to doubles action,Stojic and Dubavets have been a force to be reckoned with, losing only twice this season. They also have had an undefeated record against other top ranked doubles duos, having defeated No. 7 Gabby Smith and Giuliana Olmos of USC earlier in the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus far, Stojic and Dubavets have thrived at the collegiate level, reaching a high doubles ranking albeit playing together for just one year. Competing together has come naturally as the two have meshed quite well with an impeccable chemistry on and off the courts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are both aggressive players with a good serve, and it’s just a really good mix, so it’s all been pretty easy,” Dubavets said. “There is a lot of chemistry and confidence between us”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been pretty easy, because our game styles are pretty similar and our personalities as well. It’s been chill, all very chill when we play together,” Stojic agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two, along with the rest of the currently No. 74 ranked UCSB women’s tennis team, are players to keep an eye on as they prepare for the Big West Championships beginning this Thursday, April 28th, with hopes of making it to the NCAA Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from excelling at the collegiate level, Stojic and Dubavets are aiming to do what their competitors have already done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I still definitely want to turn pro afterwards, give it a good two years and hopefully get a sponsor that can help me work and travel and make it on the pro side” Stojic said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outlook for both players is tremendous as they have another year to work together. As long as they maintain the faith in the process, they will only continue to grow as athletes in the sport of tennis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not every year that two talented individual players with similar backgrounds and expectations of the sport can come together and play with something to prove. But sometimes, just sometimes, greatness comes in pairs.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/greatness-comes-in-pairs/","id":83,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[82,81,80],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
