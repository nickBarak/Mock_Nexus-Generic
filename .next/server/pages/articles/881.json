History seemed to repeat itself, as that was again the same story.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was heated, with both teams going blow for blow. In a quarter that was a fast-paced battle consisting of back-and-forth basketball, neither team led by more than four points.</p>\n<p>Looking at the scoreboard, it was 45-44 after the third – UCSB clinging on to their one-point advantage going into the last quarter of regulation.</p>\n<p>The visitors opened their last quarter with a subpar performance, scoring just three points over the first seven minutes. During that same time, UC Davis outscored their opponents 15-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos attempted to stomp their way back into the game to get the win, but ultimately their attempt was futile. The Aggies outscored UCSB 25-18 in the last quarter of regulation, solidifying their second win against Santa Barbara in just a few days.</p>\n<p>UCSB Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a monster game, leading all scorers with 25 points – equaling her career-high. Bates was on fire from long range, draining seven of twelve from downtown.</p>\n<p>The only other players scoring double digits for the visiting Gauchos were redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman who scored 13 points, and senior guard Makala Roper who notched 12 points of her own.</p>\n<p>Edelman had her fifth double-double of the season, seasoning 10 rebounds to go along with her 13 points. And Roper’s 12 points were scored as she came off the bench, and she impressively went four of five from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos who scored in double digits were seemingly the only gleaming spot for the visiting team, as the rest of the team went only went 4 for 27 from the field. The Aggies had four of their starters contribute double digits in the matchup, with redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch leading her team, scoring 16 points.</p>\n<p>Senior combo guard/forward Dani Nafekh came through in the clutch and made her presence known for the home team in the fourth quarter, splashing eight of her ten points in the final quarter.</p>\n<p>Nafekh drained two three-pointers in a crucial time of the game and gave the Aggies a five-point lead, getting them out of their late two-point deficit.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face another important battle, as they are set to go face-to-face with the Cal State Northridge Matadors at home in the Thunderdome on Wednesday, January 31, at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/gauchos-struggle-to-knock-off-unbeaten-uc-davis-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/gauchos-struggle-to-knock-off-unbeaten-uc-davis-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/gauchos-struggle-to-knock-off-unbeaten-uc-davis-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/gauchos-struggle-to-knock-off-unbeaten-uc-davis-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/gauchos-struggle-to-knock-off-unbeaten-uc-davis-on-the-road/","id":881,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[880,879,878],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson","biography":"Not available","articles":[131,204,215,657,663,711,766,844,881,895,896,942,943,948,949,974,1877,3388,3400],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Take Down Aggies in OT","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Junior guard Orlando Johnson scored a career-high 39 points and junior forward James Nunnally added 23 of his own in the UCSB men’s basketball team’s 93-86 overtime win over UC Davis at the Thunde...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Junior guard Orlando Johnson scored a career-high 39 points and junior forward James Nunnally added 23 of his own in the UCSB men’s basketball team’s 93-86 overtime win over UC Davis at the Thunderdome on Saturday night.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=20281 align=”alignright” width=”136″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-02-06/gauchos-aggies-ot/wade_mbball/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-32909\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wade_Mbball-136x250.jpg?resize=136%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"136\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32909\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>The Aggies’ Mark Payne, a 6’8” point guard, scored a career-high 33 points for Davis, which fell to 3-7 in the Big West.

But what I love is [our] response.”</p>\n<p>Down by nine points with just under four minutes remaining in regulation, UCSB went on a 13-4 run heading into overtime, triggered by two free throws and a contested layup by Johnson.</p>\n<p>At 78-73 with 1:30 to play, senior forward Jon Pastorek was fouled in the backcourt. He split the free throws, but junior guard Christian Peterson — who played in the four spot against Davis — grabbed the offensive board. After calling a timeout, the Gauchos drew up another play for Johnson, who was fouled on the layup attempt. He made both free throws to bring the Aggies’ lead down to three.</p>\n<p>“Christian was big for us in this ball game tonight,” Johnson said. “Three offensive rebounds [and] he’s only 6’2”. He really just played his heart out. When we get that consistent effort from everybody, we can show what kind of team we could be.”</p>\n<p>Near the end of regulation, Williams began substituting Johnson and Nunnally out on the Gauchos’ defensive possessions in order to keep his two best players rested. Still, the small Gaucho backcourt of senior guards Justin Joyner and Jordan Weiner forced a traveling violation against the Aggies with 47.2 seconds left in regulation.</p>\n<p>“Jordan and [Joyner], those two are just ballhawks,” Johnson said. “They really helped me and James [pressure the] wings and create turnovers.”</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos down 78-76, Johnson hit another contested layup to tie the game with 37.8 seconds to play. After another Gaucho timeout, Williams substituted Nunnally and Johnson out again on defense, calling for a full-court press. The Aggies’ Eddie Miller drew the foul on the ground in the front court with 33.4 seconds to play, but missed the first free throw of a one-and-one and Weiner grabbed the rebound. With 17 seconds on the clock, Nunnally hit a pull-up bank shot in the lane to give UCSB an 80-78 lead.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to get to the rim,” Nunnally said. “I knew I was either going to get fouled or going to make it.”</p>\n<p>In the ensuing possession, Payne drove down the court and made a jumper from inside the free-throw line, tying the game at 80 with 5.7 seconds left. In the last possession of regulation, Weiner found himself open for a sideline three-pointer but the shot fell short, sending the game to overtime.</p>\n<p>With the score tied 86-86 in overtime, Johnson hit two more free throws to give the Gauchos the lead. At 89-86, the Aggies called a timeout and drew up a play for Payne, who drove into the lane for a shot that Johnson swatted away.</p>\n<p>“I [saw] him coming and he looked like he was going off balance, [so I knew] I’m not taking a charge right here, I’m going for the block,” Johnson said. “I felt like Greg Somogyi.”</p>\n<p>UCSB heads to UC Riverside this Thursday to take on the Highlanders and to UC Irvine this Saturday in a matchup  against the Anteaters.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32907\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-06/gauchos-aggies-ot/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32907\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-06/gauchos-aggies-ot/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-06/gauchos-aggies-ot/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-06/gauchos-aggies-ot/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-06/gauchos-aggies-ot/","id":878,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[877,876,875],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hot-Shooting Aggies Top UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite a second consecutive strong performance from junior guard Emilie Johnson, the UCSB women’s basketball team lost at UC Davis 74-70 on Saturday.

Senior post player Paige Mintun added 13 points for the Aggies while junior wing player Lauren Juric had 11 points.</p>\n<p>Valentine said that every remaining game would be a challenge for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We need a good start going into the conference tournament,” Valentine said. “We need to learn to be consistent and come prepared every game ready to win.”</p>\n<p>With only seven games left in the season, time is running short for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“The big picture is that we need to keep getting better,” Gottlieb said. “The team that keeps getting better will win in Anaheim. When we are at our best, we are tough to beat.”</p>\n<p>The next game for UCSB is on Thursday Feb. 10 when they host Irvine.

the backup point guard for UCSB, has already become a game-changer in her first year and has provided the Gauchos with consistently solid play.</p>\n<p>“Nicole brings an entirely different element to our team,” Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb said of the freshman. “She has an explosiveness and an ability to get to the paint that not only helps her generate points, but also get looks for other people.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction

athleticism.</p>\n<p>“[Nicole] brings a ton of energy,” Gottlieb added. “At this level, to have someone that comes off the bench that can change the game is such a big advantage for us.”</p>\n<p>Growing up, Nesbit was a dancer rather than a point guard, but once she was introduced to basketball as a nine-year-old, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>“The first time I went to a tryout, it felt like it fit,” Nesbit said. “I had so much fun. My parents told me that it took me a couple of days to take off my basketball shoes. I fell in love with the game.”</p>\n<p>Nicole is always one of the smaller players on her teams, but that has not stopped her from finding success.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that size limits anything,” Nesbit said. “You just have to work a little bit harder or be a little tougher than the players you go up against.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the player who had the biggest influence on Nesbit growing up was former NBA all-star Allen Iverson. His small size and ability to attack the basket over larger defenders provided the guard with a source of inspiration.</p>\n<p>With energy off the bench, Nesbit’s role on the team this year has constantly grown, progressing into an especially important one for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It’s been so fun to watch her grow this year,” junior guard Emilie Johnson said. “From the first game until now, she has learned so much and improved her game. I’m excited to see how that pays off in a year and how good we can be next year.”</p>\n<p>Johnson has been a mentor to Nesbit, helping her to become more mature with her game. The influence goes the other way, too.</p>\n<p>“Her play has definitely opened up my game,” Johnson said. “She draws so many defenders because she is so quick and that gives me an extra second to focus and make my shot.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the season, Nesbit has proved that she is ready to go out and conquer any challenges thrown her way. Despite the struggles that come with adjusting to college, Nesbit has managed to excel, thanks largely to her family.</p>\n<p>“I think they have been to every one of my games,” Nesbit said. “It’s a huge transition from high school, school-wise and basketball-wise. Having my parents here has been a huge help and I really appreciate them for that.”</p>\n<p>Fellow UCSB players have helped Nesbit adjust to college as well, as Nesbit has grown incredibly close to her teammates.</p>\n<p>“Our team is like one big happy family,” Nesbit said. “Being with the team is my most exciting time of the day. When we leave practice, we miss each other.”</p>\n<p>In particular, Nesbit has grown close to fellow freshman guard Melissa Zornig.</p>\n<p>“We are really tight off the court and I think I am closest with her,” Zornig said. “I’m really excited to be able to play with her over the next three years.”</p>\n<p>Along with the rest of the team, Nesbit has one goal in mind for the 2011 season.</p>\n<p>“As far as basketball, winning the state championship in high school was my biggest accomplishment,” Nesbit said. “That was one of the proudest moments of my life, and that’s why I want a Big West championship, because I would be on that stage on a different level and with different people.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit and UCSB host UC Irvine tonight at the Thunderdome, with a scheduled tip-off of 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/","id":880,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[879,878,877],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
