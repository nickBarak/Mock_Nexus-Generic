Man, you’re probably the oldest person here.” Ouch. Like big wooden splinter in the soft spot between your toes kind of ouch. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I went on a frat’s Las Vegas / Lake Havasu date party recently, and while the weekend offered enough stories to fuel a two-story house boat, one of the more memorable comments came from the frosh crowd I shacked up with: “Oh wow, you’re a senior? Man, you’re probably the oldest person here.” Ouch. Like big wooden splinter in the soft spot between your toes kind of ouch. Let’s just ignore the fact that there were a plethora of seniors besides myself present and focus instead on the problem facing younger generations today (besides the economy and the rapidly rising rates of venereal disease): they’re freshmen. Anyone with a sixth sense and mediocre eavesdropping skills can verify that many teeny bopper college kids rank somewhere on the one to 10 virgin scale — one being the only insertion is tampon-related, and 10 being, “well, it almost went all the way in.” These varying levels of inexperience are pretty effective deterrents against gaining the respect and nudity these kids so desire from the upper classes.</p>\n<p>For some seniors, age is but a number. For others, freshman-fucking is more apt to be found on the fuckit list than the bucket list. Four years ago I ranked about a seven on that scale (use your imagination), but I have to admit that hooking up with the youngest members of our collegiate tribe didn’t appeal to me even then. My objection came from my desire for someone who knew what to do with their hands and tongue and hips… all at the same time. I know, I know. Huge expectations.</p>\n<p>After the fratastic foreplay festival, however, my perspective on the younger classes widened a bit. The girls I met weren’t catty, just kooky. And the boys? The boys were kind enough to bring along their ripped abs and freshly-packed nug-jugs (note the lack of beer bellies — a work of art mastered only after years of dedicated pong). It wasn’t until I shared a bed with a younger, shorter Channing Tatum lookalike that I considered the upside of robbing the cradle. Despite his age and our adorably PG cuddle session, I think we had the potential for a scandalous remake of “The Graduate.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of my hottest senior citizen friends (who will make an excellent cougar some day, if she so chooses) has a knack for finding suitably scruffy, nicely muscled youngins’. Seriously, I think 90 percent of her play dates past have been two years her junior. I recently realized that this girl’s relationships / hookups / outreach programs have provided her with a far more lucrative sex life compared to my friends who only date up. The younger generations are not dramatic baby mamas and do not possess neuroticisms about monogamy.  They are as well-endowed as their brothers from other mothers and eager to learn the tricks of the trade.</p>\n<p>They’re also well-prepared, probably because they’re so excited by the prospect of sex. In Lake Havasu, stories circulated about a boy who pulled a condom out of his board shorts. Do you think he’d have gotten laid if he left the steamy shower in search of a condom dispenser? No. And not because there were no condom dispensers hidden among the rocks at the lake, but because he came prepared. And then he just came.</p>\n<p>Semi-corrupting, willing and mutually-attracted Ashton Kutcher or Catherine Zeta Jones types can be undeniably sexy, as Demi Moore and Michael Douglas have demonstrated. It is not, however, acceptable for a 24-year-old to seduce a pair of 17-year-old twins with big smiles and perky hoo-has. There’s a fine line between “Here’s to you, Mrs. Robinson” and “What time is your curfew?” Lawsuits are unpleasant, as are stage five clingers, so before you storm FT hoping to act out your Freshman Fantasy, make extra sure it’s on the legal side of El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to battle my roommates for the baby-faced skater boy across the street… oh shit. That’s a girl.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23489\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-19/robbing-cradle-added-senior-bucket-list/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23489\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-19/robbing-cradle-added-senior-bucket-list/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-19/robbing-cradle-added-senior-bucket-list/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-19/robbing-cradle-added-senior-bucket-list/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-19/robbing-cradle-added-senior-bucket-list/","id":6446,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6445,6444,6443],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[5709,5710,5717,6012,6093,6095,6096,6123,6125,6127,6128,6132,6151,6152,6160,6165,6172,6174,6175,6176,6178,6182,6187,6194,6195,6211,6215,6216,6218,6232,6247,6248,6252,6253,6260,6261,6314,6331,6343,6358,6393,6394,6396,6401,6412,6416,6423,6424,6439,6441,6446,6447,6456,6458],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Disciplined Religious Chastity Captivates the Promiscuous","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The life of an exchange student is a constant influx of new experiences, knowledge, food, ideas and people — basically whatever you can put into your mouth, grab by the hand or both.

Nothing, however, could have prepared me for what a new class project partner said to me this week.

I’ll take ‘conservative religion’ for 500, Alex.

Although I have chosen this particular spiritual path, I am of course aware that credence in religion is the foundation of many people’s lives. Likewise, sexuality, either the performance or restraint thereof, is as important in personality determination. The choice this young man has made about his sexuality is a determining factor of who he is, and this is all rooted in his faith.</p>\n<p>If religion plays a major role in one’s sexuality, and sexuality is a key component to one’s lifestyle, where does that leave the body’s desire to seek pleasure in the eyes of religion? Sex, kissing, touching or at the very least flirtation is how we mingle. It’s our way to break the ice and test compatibility. Could my perfect sexual match pass me by because he’s waiting and I’m not pure enough? How can we ever find someone to marry and have all this ‘sinless’ sex with if we are taught to be ashamed of that desire in the first place? Could faith and the learned avoidance of earthly pleasures be keeping us from finding love?</p>\n<p>In the book of Genesis, before Adam’s rib-baby gives into temptation and fucks up any chance we future generations may have had at sexuality free of remorse or disdain, a fascinating sentiment felt by both Eve and her male counterpart is highlighted. To quote the Old Testament following the creation of Eve, “And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed” (Genesis 1.2-25). It is not until paradise is lost that any shame is felt between the two unclothed individuals. Thus, there is a moment when bodily sexuality and spiritual sensuality are completely at one, and neither is something to be embarrassed about.</p>\n<p>I admire the steadfast devotion many of my friends have for their faiths, so I truly mean no disrespect when I say that if I were religious, I would like to believe in a higher power that would want me to be proud of the body I have been given and not feel ashamed about the way I consent to use it. I do not choose to see my sexuality as inherently evil. Perhaps this is why I could not imagine subjecting myself to the life of self-restraint my colleague and so many others have chosen.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I am utterly captivated by such discipline. The fact that someone can feel so strongly about what he/she believes as to completely cut out a part of human nature is pretty incredible. So I’m thinking it’s time for secular and devout communities to come to a major compromise, because if there’s one thing I do believe, it’s that a religious debate between believer and nonbeliever cannot be won.</p>\n<p>When it comes to sexuality and religion, it’s as simple as this: withhold judgment. My promiscuity should be of as much concern to you as your repression is to me — none at all. The majority of the population isn’t making sexual decisions to personally offend another party. Just be who you are and let everyone else do the same.<br>\nAnd if there is a God, I can tell you that he’s getting a whole lot of ironic attention from my orgasms. Now, do climax screaming fits count as prayer?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35401\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35401\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/disciplined-religious-chastity-captivates-promiscuous/","id":6443,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6442,6441,6440],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stereotypes of Sexual Abstinence Harm Healthy Sexuality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"My name is SF and I am celibate.

It has been a ridiculously long time since my last penetration, and I am here to defend my choice of abstinence.<br>\nI would first like to clarify that I am in no way claiming any kind of born-again virtuosity. I am merely confronting my lack-of-sack and presenting an argument in my defense. To be entirely honest, the thing is, I am sick of being treated like shit and then being expected to get on my knees and suck it up just so I can get laid.<br>\nYes, sex is amazing. But it definitely hasn’t been amazing with some of the people I have been with, and I’m starting to realize that I have no interest in reliving past mistakes. In order to have no regrets, one must wash, rinse and never repeat.<br>\nPopular, hypersexualized culture would have me believe that this humping hiatus I’m experiencing is a “dry spell” — as if I have become some kind of barren landscape victim to Mother Nature’s withholding of fertilization. When we choose to abstain until marriage, we are labeled virgins-in-waiting, but when we choose to abstain from sex post-cherry pop, we are cursed as victims of a drought. So I’m supposed to feel ashamed when I’m having “too much” sex and even more embarrassed when I’m not having any?<br>\nAs much as I hate giving in to gender stereotypes, this situation is so different for women than it is for men. I’m not saying that men are slaves to their animal urges and have no coital filter. What I am suggesting is that women are usually presented with more situations where saying no and fighting off sex with someone they aren’t down to sleep with is necessary.<br>\nAt risk of sounding like a bitter old maid, how the hell do guys expect intercourse to be the end result of these horrible, offensive “moves” they’re putting on? Mind you, I live in Europe, which means the men I deal with on a day-to-night basis are instantly creepier. Last weekend I literally had a guy applaud, whistle and say “bravo” to me in passing. If you are wearing skin-tight women’s pants and enough gel in your hair to lubricate Andre the Giant’s penis, you are not allowed to up the ante on your sliminess by being a douchebag.<br>\nOK, so I.V. boys don’t necessarily spank your ass in place of shaking your hand like Euro-men do. I’ll give you that. But enough of the cause and back to the not-so-erect effect.<br>\nFor whatever reason, many people choose not to fornicate, and these people are called prudes. I hooked up with a guy my friend introduced me to last week, chose not to have sex with him and was called a prude for that decision. Me? A prude? This is crazy!<br>\nSo I’m either a slut or a prude. Are these my only choices? I feel like Goldilocks. I can be too hot and too cold, but how much sex is just right for a woman to have?<br>\nThis is not a ‘dry spell’ or a ‘slow season.’ I could go home with some loser tonight and get laid. The point is that right now, I’m actually enjoying not having meaningless, respectless sex. And when I decide that no-strings-attached arrangements are what I want again, I’ll do that. Just stop labeling me, because I’m never going to find the perfect sexual formula.<br>\nOne of my best friends is a virgin, and she is one of the hottest, sexiest chicks I know. She’s not waiting for marriage or Prince Charming. She’s going to have sex when it happens and feels right, and I think that is absolutely wonderful. And even though she’s never been penetrated, she is an extremely sexual person. The number of dicks you’ve hosted for the night has nothing to do with how in tune you are with your sexual self.<br>\nThere may be some prudes who exist out there, but I sure as hell have never met one. Sexuality is so much more than whether your daiquiri is virgin or not. I know some olive oil bottles that have got it going on but are denounced because of their ‘extra virgin’ labels.<br>\nSo until someone decides what amount of sex is the perfect amount, and until someone treats me like a human being rather than a set of fleshy holes, I’ll be standing by and waiting. And yes, I’m as horny as a housecat in heat; but in retrospect, sometimes it feels really good to wake up alone.</p>\n<p><em></em><em><br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36656\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36656\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/stereotypes-sexual-abstinence-harm-healthy-sexuality/","id":6444,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6443,6442,6441],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bedroom Etiquette for Dummies","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Communication about sex is by default neither easy nor common for parents, so excuse their embarrassment and take it upon yourself to be learn how to be polite.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>We all grow up receiving our parents instructions about good manners (well in theory), yet their teachings only cover their respectable domains – the dining room, church, etc. But I’m willing to bet you were not taught basic bedroom etiquette at the dinner table. Communication about sex is by default neither easy nor common for parents, so excuse their embarrassment and take it upon yourself to be learn how to be polite.</p>\n<p>Come 5th grade, everyone wanted to learn about sex, and naturally you sought your education from 30 year old perverts in AOL chat rooms (think chat roulette circa 1999). This may have taught you how to politely ask for nudes, but not quite the fundamentals of being a respectful partner in the bedroom. So unless your mother encouraged you to make new friends followed with, “and don’t make fun of how someone tastes,” most of you are clueless of what manners should be followed. </p>\n<p>Being a polite sexual partner isn’t moving the tea party into the bedroom. Aside from the occasional “please” and “thank you,” it’s more about having consideration for the other person.  It doesn’t matter if it’s a hook-up or a relationship; half the fun is pleasing the other person.  By following some basic rules you can avoid offending, hurting or making someone feel uncomfortable during those potentially daunting tasks.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First off, one should never assume that the other person is down, pun intended, as some people have contrary values or religious beliefs (well not anyone in IV, but maybe you’re going abroad..) Pressuring someone is best left in middle school.</p>\n<p>Secondly, once you know you’ve bedded a willing partner, you can continue being a considerate member of society by remembering to never push on your buddy’s head…unless you’d like to mutually excite yourself and their gag reflex.  There’s a time and place to have your hands down there, but in the meantime, the pushing can make someone feel taken advantage of. If you can’t sympathize with that, maybe a canine piercing your privates will stop you from dribbling your partner’s head like a basketball.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, without going into great detail: before a sticky situation should arise, you should talk about where that sticky situation should end up… and I’ll give you a hint – it’s not on the sheets.</p>\n<p>This should not be news to a fine, young and educated individual like yourself, but a respectable, well mannered person should always use a condom.  Pregnancy and STDs can happen to anyone, and they do all the time.  Next time someone would like to nix the condom, ask yourself if you would enjoy having herpes outbreaks or a child for the rest of your life. Another bonus for those that go bear backed – the guy may even come twice as fast!  But with all things considered, condoms can make a guy last longer, keep parenthood at bay and your body STD free, so why is anyone complaining?</p>\n<p>And lastly, the Golden Rule: do to others as you want them to do to you.  This applies to all aspects of life, including your sexy time.  Nobody likes a hypocrite, so even if you’re the biggest douche bag to ever walk DP, you must always respect your partner in the bedroom and remember to make it fun for the both of you.</p>\n<p>A basic shroud of complete cluelessness surrounds our first sexual experiences, but like how we graduated from eating with our hands to using utensils, there comes a time when we learn about bedroom etiquette and use it for the benefit of ourselves and those we eat and sleep with.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25501\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-25/bedroom-etiquette-dummies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25501\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-25/bedroom-etiquette-dummies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-25/bedroom-etiquette-dummies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-25/bedroom-etiquette-dummies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-25/bedroom-etiquette-dummies/","id":6445,"author":{"id":509,"name":"Haley Snyder"},"related":[6444,6443,6442],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
