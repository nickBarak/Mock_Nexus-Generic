The shop, located at 6549 Pardall Rd., debuted on Tuesday and is both the newest and only barbershop in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before making the decision to open a second shop in I.V., Ramirez took a grassroots style approach to best figure out the location of his second shop, asking students in the community about their thoughts on having a barbershop in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I came out here, there was no barbershop, so I was like, ‘Geesh, where are these kids going [for a haircut]?’ So I started talking to kids, asking them where they get their haircut … [I found out that] a lot of them wait to go back home to get their haircut because there’s nowhere to go, and they don’t trust anybody,” Ramirez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the lack of barber shops may have posed an inconvenience to residents in the past, Ramirez believes his new shop in I.V. will remedy these problems by offering a prime location in I.V. as well as a unique customer experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For $25, many shops offer quality haircuts, but not many offer a quality experience, which Ramirez finds to be a defining characteristic in successful barbershops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accompany the debut of his new shop, Ramirez opted to include a pool table, multiple flat-screen TVs, back massagers and refreshments for patrons — all of which he is confident will contribute to the “experience” of coming to his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Getting a haircut, you shouldn’t have to be like, ‘Oh, I have to get a haircut,’ you should be stoked to get a haircut. You get to come, hangout, get here an hour early, watch the game,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s more than a barbershop. It’s an experience, and that’s what we’re providing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other ideas, Ramirez plans to make use of the large white walls surrounding the inside of the shop, flirting with the idea of featuring student-generated art. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the amenities, Ramirez’s idea of the barbershop “experience” did not occur to him overnight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before he began working as a barber, Ramirez used to frequent barbershops as often as once a week, where he was attracted to its overall atmosphere and ambiance.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86655\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86655\" data-attachment-id=\"86655\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/barbershop-debut-sparks-new-buzz-in-i-v/barber-shop-iv_ida-kazerani_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1428&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1428\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Barber Shop IV_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86655 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ramirez wants his barbershop to be a place where people come to have a good time. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was the type of guy, back then, who’d get a haircut once a week because I liked going to the barbershop. I liked hanging out, I liked talking with the boys and watching the games,”  he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With multiple shops of his own, Ramirez aims to replicate the same qualities that initially attracted him to become a regular at barbershops he frequented before he began cutting hair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cutting hair in high school, Ramirez was formally introduced to the barbershop world when he was 20, after his best friend convinced him to get his barber license and work at his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I started at a shop in Pismo Beach, came out to Santa Barbara, cut hair at a shop called Montecito Barbers, was there for five years, broke off and built my own shop. And now we’re here, number two,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently dividing his time between both locations, Ramirez used to spend all of his time at the Montecito location after opening it in 2010. Things were going smoothly for Ramirez until the massive flood ravaged through Montecito last January, making it impossible for him and his barbers to work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than waiting it out, Ramirez devised a plan to work around the flooding by setting up a pop-up shop in the back room of a wine store.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were out of work and the village was shut down, so we did a pop-up shop over at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie Slone Wines. We had this little space in the back where we put up four chairs, people came in and got their haircut … it was just a cool thing for the community to come together and help everybody out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For businesses such as Ramirez’s, mudslides can have a devastating impact on revenue, keeping customers away and making barbers unable to reach the shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the pop-up shop helped Ramirez appreciate the power of community, something he hopes to carry with him to his new location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you put a barber shop in, you become a hub of the town … We like to integrate ourselves into the community, we like to do things, have events, after-hour events,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re gonna do as much for the students as possible — this shop is for the students.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Customers pay a deposit to use a reusable cup, which is repaid when the cup is returned.</p>\n<p>“We have an exchange program, so it is $5 for a hot cup and $2 for a Mason jar, and you pay that deposit and you get your order in a reusable cup,” Yamasaki said. “If you give it back to us, we give you [the deposit] back.”</p>\n<p>In contrast to the I.V. location, the downtown location will be a Prohibition-era themed bar beginning at 5 p.m. The bar, called Lab Social, is a speakeasy-style bar, meaning that it is hidden from public view.</p>\n<p>“[The bar] is supposed to be slightly incognito,” Yamasaki said. “It is a trend that a lot of bigger cities are doing, where instead of just being a bar with the front door open, it’s a bar that is kind of hidden within another store or hidden from plain sight.”</p>\n<p>The front door will be locked at nights, and customers will have to find their way into the bar through the back entrance, according to Yamasaki.</p>\n<p>Other differences between the I.V. location and the new Cajé downtown revolve around the menu.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, we have bagels, acai bowls and smoothies,” Yamasaki said. “[Downtown], our menu right now is consisting of a tortilla española and an avocado toast, which is different than the location in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the downtown Cajé has formed a collaboration with Sama Sama Kitchen, an Asian fusion restaurant, to diversify Cajé’s menu. According to Yamasaki, the menu is expected to grow, with the full version to be rolled out come grand opening, pending a time and date to be determined.</p>\n<p>“The space is beautiful, and we are really excited to provide a downtown haven for our regulars in Cajé Isla Vista as well,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate all the love and support we have received so far. It’s actually been ridiculous how many regulars from our current location came out to show some love and some support. There is just a lot of gratitude here for that loyalty.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

apartment building. </span><em>Courtesy of I.V. CSD</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BigSpeak CEO Jonathan Wygant and Anacapa Development owner Terry Huggins are interested in redeveloping the area to increase the amount of affordable housing in I.V. as well as to create more startup/incubator spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant, whose family owns Embarcadero Hall and has a financial agreement with UC Santa Barbara that ends in 2026, said he and his siblings felt that the building could be better utilized than as just a lecture hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant and Huggins were both familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/ceo/successor-agency/isla-vista-master-plan.sbc\">Isla Vista Master Plan</a>, “a planning document for the Isla Vista area which sets forth community goals and policies to guide the future growth of Isla Vista,” and felt there was an opportunity to further develop the community, starting with the Loop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After surveying the area, the two said they wanted to create “something that could serve the community at a higher level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed renovations involve turning the Embarcadero Hall lot into an apartment building. The two would then renovate the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naan Stop, Dumpling King, Deja Vu and Rosarito </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to a multi-story building with a lecture hall, restaurants, co-working offices and startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building where the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) currently holds its meetings, 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, would become another multi-use building, housing a new I.V. Community Center and the I.V. CSD offices on the bottom floor and apartments on the upper floors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final building that Wygant and Huggins want to renovate is the current I.V. Community Center building, which is already under renovation by the I.V. CSD. Wygant and Huggins would relocate the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic to the first floor of this building, and then fill the rest of the bottom floor with restaurants. The upper floors would be more startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think that with everything that’s going on, particularly in the hard sciences out of UCSB, it could be a great place to start a business in collaboration with one of the departments or several of the departments over at UCSB,” Huggins said. “And there really isn’t anything like that in Isla Vista right now. But we’d like to provide it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins added that the new spaces would incentivize recently graduated students to stay in I.V. because of the businesses as well, although Board Director Jay Freeman questioned whether the two had actually done research on the demand for tech companies in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two envision all of the buildings to be four stories tall, but said none of them would exceed 45 feet in height. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between the three buildings located on the Embarcadero Del Mar side of the Loop, Huggins envisions a considerable amount of patio space, where students can “sit outside and have a cup of coffee.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant don’t currently own the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar, Huggins said he was “working on something.” Since the proposal is still in very early stages, Huggins said he didn’t want to take action on possibly purchasing other buildings in the Loop just yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not trying to replace the established places that people like to go in Isla Vista to eat or drink. We just want to redevelop this in a way that adds to the community rather than takes away from other people’s businesses,” Huggins added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two also believe that retail around this area would be “really revitalize[d]” by the renovations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant stressed the community benefits of the renovations, the proposal met backlash from the packed room, with several long-term residents and community members expressing concern about the potential loss of public spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Someone’s gotta say something you guys,” Pegeen Soutar, vice chairperson of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District and a resident of I.V. for 35 years, said, kicking off public comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spent some time with both these gentlemen and I’ve tried to go into things with an open mind and my concern is always for the community, but I have concerns about even this variation of the plan,” Soutar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a community center finally; after many, many years, it’s going to be open in August. We’ve been waiting 40 years for this and I think it’s going to be beautiful…I think it’s going to be what we need and it’s a great start for us. If somewhere in the future we decide we need more space, when we’ve proven that we’ve burst out of the doors of that one, then I think that’s something that we as a community can discuss,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So, I’m not, right now, seeing a benefit to the community to put things on hold or to change things that already exist right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soutar also pointed out the lack of parking allocation in the plan or any research on the environmental impact of having more people frequenting the Loop. Soutar said she respected the two for reaching out and asking the community for feedback, but said “at this point, I’m so excited for what we have already.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen echoed Soutar’s comments, pointing out that having that many UCSB students on that side of the Loop would cause a slew of traffic problems for cars, bikers and pedestrians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another community member stood up, pointed at the proposal sketch and dryly said, “Welcome to Los Angeles, eventually.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once public comment was over, the I.V. CSD returned to its discussion and questioning. All the board members expressed concern with I.V. losing the public spaces that it very recently created for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSD Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said he was uncomfortable with the idea of people coming in from the outside and changing the landscape of I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of this is a process of questions, and questions are important. But there is also a visceral reaction that I’m sure some of us in this room have which is somehow beyond those questions,” Hedges said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At least three of us remaining on the board sit here because… one of our taglines was ‘nothing for us without us.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Visioning is something best done by those who will live out that vision rather than those who have good ideas from the outside.
