Across the UC system and here at UCSB, the university’s insufficient support for student mental health services makes this far from a reality. According to the American College Health Association, 30 percent of college students report being too depressed to function. One in five college students will be diagnosed with depression during their undergraduate career. For the past three years, the number of new students seen by UCSB’s Counseling And Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has increased by an average of 26 percent. While C.A.P.S. has expanded and continues to support an increasing number of students, the amount of funding provided to our mental health services at UCSB does not meet the needs of our student body. This disconnect between C.A.P.S.’s needs and its capacity has been damaging.<br>\nStudents have expressed dissatisfaction in the wait times for appointments. Clinicians are not provided adequate space and room accommodations. In a setting where we want to promote racial and gender equity, our counseling staff does not adequately reflect the diversity of our student body. Furthermore, the culture of our campus is not yet one that entirely fosters mental health.<br>\n“#HowAreYou: A Call to Reform Student Mental Health Services” is a UC Student Association (UCSA) campaign working to improve the accessibility, diversity and outreach in mental health services at each UC. UCSA has created an expansive rubric in order to grade mental health services on each campus. The rubric measures certain aspects of our counseling services, such as wait times, the trend in intake appointments, the diversity of clinicians, Full Time Equivalent (FTE)-to-student ratio, etc. in order to diagnose areas in which C.A.P.S. can improve. As a result of this study, UCSA awarded UCSB’s C.A.P.S. a grade of C+.<br>\nThis grade is not to criticize C.A.P.S. or C.A.P.S. Staff, who have worked innovatively to improve services with the limited resources they have, but rather to bring to light the damage that comes when such vital student resources are allowed to be under resourced. We hope that this serves as a call to action, both for the community to be more aware of the services and its necessary changes and for UCSB administration to do more about improving this vital service on campus.<br>\nUCSB’s C.A.P.S. excels as they allow students to be seen the same day that they come and express they need help. Other campuses have same day appointments, but only for students exhibiting signs of crisis, and some have no kinds of same day appointments at all. These walk-in appointments are a unique innovation — started at UCSB — that maximize the potential of our clinical staff while also setting our campus up to be one that provides resources on a needs basis. However, this does not support students who require long-term care, because follow-up appointments must still be scheduled weeks in advance.<br>\nUCSB also leads in counseling services, compared to the other UCs, with our mental health peer program, in which students work with C.A.P.S. to provide resources to others in need. C.A.P.S. has excelled in preventing suicide with our #SaySomething campaign, and has made great strides in supporting our black students in response to a series of demands made by the Black Student Union in 2013.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68781\" style=\"width: 593px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68781\" data-attachment-id=\"68781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/ucsb-caps-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"594,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB CAPS 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2-250x161.png?resize=583%2C376\" alt=\"Image courtesy of UCSA\" width=\"583\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?w=594&amp;ssl=1 594w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of UCSA</p></div>\n<p>These are the things that we must do to ensure that students will receive adequate mental health services:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

\r\n</script> \n<p><strong>1. The hiring of more diverse and culturally competent clinicians:</strong></p>\n<p>National trends indicate that people of color use mental health services at a lower rate than their white counterparts. African Americans and Chican@/Latin@ Americans used mental health services at about one half the rate of Caucasian Americans in the past year. In the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) community, that rate shrank to one third. Studies have shown that matching the race and sex of the therapist to that of the client increases the acceptability and effectiveness of treatment services. As a Hispanic Serving Institution, UCSB should not be this drastically lacking Hispanic serving clinicians. Thus, the hiring of API, Chican@/Latin@, South Asian, Middle Eastern and North African serving clinicians is a must.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The expansion and improvement of the C.A.P.S. building:</strong></p>\n<p>Accessibility and comfort are necessary for fostering an environment that supports mental health. Our current facility is struggling for space. With a new state of the art facility at UCSB, students will be able to receive care with more comfort and convenience. Climate controlled, spacious and confidential spaces have proven to help students in therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The integration of mental health services in academic and student life:</strong></p>\n<p>Placing a therapist in the residence halls provides more benefits than just the ease in accessibility. When therapists are in the residence halls, it contributes to an environment in which the residents understand that support is around them and accessible to them when they need it. For this reason, therapists should be placed wherever there is a high density of students, including residence halls, university apartments and areas on campus where stigma around mental health can be greater, like the S.T.E.M. buildings.<br>\nThe university should be a place where students thrive, not just endure. The changes we are calling for will allow us to address long wait times and short staffing and can create an environment on campus where we can truly care for all of us, especially those populations that are most vulnerable. This past summer, a group of UC students who were tired of week-long waiting times for their friends, frustrated with C.A.P.S. centers that didn’t have therapists that came from their communities and who believed deeply in the need to create a culture of compassion launched the #HowAreYou campaign. As students, we made improving our mental health services our priority; it’s time our administration did the same.</p>\n<p>Signed,<br>\nSiavash Zohoori, Mental Health Coordinator<br>\nLillian Cain, Policy Analyst<br>\nMohsin Mirza, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs<br>\nAnumita Kaur, Campus Organizing Director</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/","id":5762,"author":{"id":402,"name":"Siavash Zohoori"},"related":[5761,5760,5759],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":402,"name":"Siavash Zohoori","biography":"Not available","articles":[5762],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"‘Halloween’: In Review","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/halloween-2018-1536161981.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/halloween-2018-1536161981.jpg?resize=480%2C240&ssl=1","description":"“Halloween” having yet another sequel at this point kind of just sounds like having another “Paranormal Activity.”","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Netflix, Hulu and all the other streaming services, during the month of October I would scroll through all the cable channels to find a new horror film. The two that stood out most, and that were constantly played, were “A Nightmare On Elm Street” and “Halloween.” Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers are two of the most timeless classic horror villains, and both have had iconic original films that impacted audiences around the world and left imprints in the nightmares of both children and adults. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common element among these films is that they both seem to have taken on exhaustingly long quests by creating an abundance of sequels which, oftentimes, did not land as well as the original. Now another trend has risen where films premier during the Halloween season hoping to become blockbusters. While the numbers in attendance may be flattering, most fail to become cult classics. I write this critique in a tentative manner after watching the latest installment of the “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series, which, although not perfect, was undoubtedly a fun, nostalgia-filled, slasher film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” having yet another sequel at this point kind of just sounds like having another “Paranormal Activity.” Nevertheless, hearing that wretched opening music, combined with the word “Halloween” in dripping, bright orange letters brought out a childlike reaction that had me wanting more. The “Halloween” series built itself by delivering murder scenes fueled with cynicism and other elements that are the quintessence of horror filmmaking. On the surface, Michael Myers can be seen as the average person, a slow-paced walking man wearing a mask. But it’s these details, combined with the idea that he is basically immortal (based on the many times he’s either shot in the face or burned alive), that make Myers, or the notion of him, an uncomfortable, deep-seated fear in the hearts of many. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween” sticks to its guns and hovers through some of the original filmmaking tactics and classic murder sequences honed throughout the series. It’s the deadly nighttime appearances by Michael Myers and the lack of a purpose behind his rampant killing spree as he sticks his legendary chef’s knife through a random woman’s throat that keeps the audience jumping in their seats. What pushed horror films like “Halloween” out of the mainstream was the use of enhanced technology and horrific costume designs combined with the too many jump scares. This new “Halloween” undoubtedly shows director David Gordon Green’s appreciation for old-school cinematography and screenwriting. The fact that Green has chosen to stray from integrating more modern takes on horror into this new “Halloween” film is indeed ambitious, but it can also create quite a few setbacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dialogue in some of the scenes of this movie are incredibly cringeworthy. Awkward pauses and panel switches feel somewhat outdated, which can be a result of Green’s choice to keep the film’s aesthetic much like the original’s. While watching “Halloween,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could not help but dwell on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliché</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> plot holes about a lame high school dance and teenage romance, which are made out to be at the forefront of the film. This is all too common in slasher films — we get a variety of disposable characters and multiple plotlines that cut into the runtime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best parts about this rendition, if not</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best, is the return of Jamie Lee Curtis and her portrayal of  Laurie Strode. Oct. 26 marks the 40-year anniversary since the initial release of the original “Halloween” film, and she has not aged a bit. We are brought into Strode’s present life after being haunted by the traumatic experiences from her past with Myers, and she is rightfully transformed into a deadly assassin looking for vengeance. While it seems like her granddaughter (Andi Matichak) is supposed to be at the forefront of the film, Curtis steals the show. Her presence could have been utilized much more, considering most people who watched the film have a closer connection with Laurie Strode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from Jamie Lee Curtis, the performances in “Halloween” are not incredible, and the movie is far from being phenomenal. However, it was entertaining and fun to have the new generation understand, at least somewhat, the importance of a character such as Michael Myers during the Halloween season. “Halloween”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is meant to be a simple film, with no complex plot that requires an in-depth analysis. The hardest thing to figure out, though … is Michael Myers actually dead this time?</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Venom’s comic book origin story. The question is, can Venom hold his own movie without his better third? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venom has Spider-Man’s eyes. Venom has powers that are mostly Spider-Man’s. I mean, come on! In Venom’s appearances in comic books, animated movie and other forms of media, he has a spider symbol on his chest just like Spider-Man!

Shockingly enough, these aliens can’t survive in a foreign, oxygen-rich environment like Earth. Unfortunately, symbiotes can’t just bond to any organism à la blood types and organ transplants; they need to find an exact match, or the host will die within minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our reluctant hero, journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), just so happens to be an exact match. Hardy delivers an immersive experience both as Eddie Brock and Venom and also voices the titular symbiote/symbiote-human pairing. The film delves into several inconsistently paced and edited themes. At times the film is portrayed as a horror film, as a thriller and, perhaps most frequently, as an action film. Despite the sometimes inconsistent editing of the film’s themes, Hardy manifests these themes and immerses the audience in them exceptionally well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s antagonist, CEO of the Life Foundation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), sees a world “on the brink of collapse” and wants to use these symbiotes to forcibly evolve humanity. Though his goal is somewhat noble, Drake leaves behind no moral ambiguity, considering human beings as “disposable” and willingly subjecting humans to disturbing deaths as he tries to find the key to achieving his goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigating the Life Foundation, the Venom symbiote bonds with Brock. Brock, while attempting to manage his “guest,”  is hunted down by Drake’s men as he simultaneously assesses what the symbiote is doing to him with the help of his former girlfriend, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams). As the symbiote and Brock bond physically and socially, Drake bonds with another symbiote, Riot. Brock and Venom seek to stop Drake and Riot, who set out to obtain millions of symbiotes so that Riot may take over the Earth and Drake may evolve humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fight between Venom and Riot breaks out, featuring excellent cinematography, choreography and, above all, superb special effects, all of which can be seen previously in the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, there are some editing and pacing issues (sometimes creating logic holes in the film), as well as a lack of character development, but these issues are ultimately overshadowed by Tom Hardy’s stellar performance, general direction of the film, spectacular effects, choreography and cinematography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don’t particularly enjoy the film, I’d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recommend staying for the scene during the closing credits.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/","id":5760,"author":{"id":52,"name":"Manuel Carlos"},"related":[5759,5758,5757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Statement From Inter-Fraternity Council President Regarding Allegations of Bribery in A.S.

This includes the recent Associated Students Elections. In order to encourage our members to perform their civic responsibility as students, IFC offered grants to chapters that achieved high voter turnout, which the chapter is required to use towards their philanthropic purposes. The IFC viewed this as a way to further two of its core principles- student participation and philanthropy in the local community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IFC has been unequivocally transparent about these grants. When it was brought to our attention that Associated Students Election Board was investigating the grants, the IFC issued a formal letter to Elections Board to dispel any rumors or misinformation that they may have received. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IFC felt comfortable doing so because we know that we have not broken any rules or regulations. There is absolutely no clause in Associated Students Legal Code that prohibits such programs. Nor is there any such clause in Office of Student Life (OSL) Statement of Regulations, which every campus organization is required to follow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IFC did not develop this program without consultation from our advisor who also serves as the Director of OSL. He recalled that many other UCSB campus organizations have used similar programs to incentivize voter turnout in AS elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many other administrative staff, who have extensive knowledge of AS Legal Code and the OSL Statement of Regulations, are well aware of the grant and have absolutely no concerns about it being a violation of existing policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Inter-Fraternity Council will not engage with people who call our organization’s integrity into question. Again, my only hope from this statement is that the students hear the truth and are able to see that the Inter-Fraternity Council has not broken any rules, nor is it afraid to be 100 percent transparent and truthful about what has transpired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, I will be attending AS Senate meeting tonight at 6:30 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion, so that Senate can hear the truth and the facts, rather than the rumors and misconceptions that have been spread around campus over the past 24 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sincerely,</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brendan D.
