The Rainbow Wahine defeated UCSB 25-13, 25-14, 25-19. The beginning of Big West play symbolized a clean slate for Santa Barbara, but unfortunately the team’s losing slump extended to seven games. UCSB is now 4-8, 0-1 in conference play and were swept for the fourth time in its last five games. The Gauchos’ offensive errors served as a setback against a dominant Hawaii team. UCSB recorded a total of 17 attacking errors against the University of Hawaii’s six.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58068\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"169675182\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64882\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58068\" data-attachment-id=\"58068\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/weekend-sweep-places-ucsb-into-contention/w-volleyball-v-uc-irvine-by-eric-swenson_for-11-09-2014/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=1200%2C807&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,807\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415480609\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"W Volleyball v UC Irvine by Eric Swenson_for 11.09.2014-\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=888%2C597&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58068\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=294%2C198\" alt=\"Senior oustide hitter Ali Barbeau attempting to make a block at the net.

We did that at times, we just didn’t sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Last season marked the end of the Rainbow Wahine’s illustrious streak of 19 consecutive conference championships, a winning stretch that combined their success in both the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and Big West conferences, respectively. With this year’s pre-season prediction to earn a first-place finish in the Big West poll, it was a prominent first step for a Hawaii team that is determined to regain its conference notoriety. The Rainbow Wahine improved to 12-1 and are now 2-0 versus Big West opponents after sweeps of UCSB and Cal Poly this weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nearly 7,000 people filled Hawaii’s Stan Sheriff Center on Friday, indicating the long-awaited conference opener. Despite the daunting atmosphere, UCSB managed to hold its ground in the match’s beginning.</p>\n<p>A combination of kills, one service ace and one assisted block helped Santa Barbara go on an early 5-2 run. Still, a mentally well-equipped team like Hawaii did not panic as it rallied back with a 4-0 run of its own, taking a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s lead remained at a tight margin, but a kill by junior opposite Nikki Taylor triggered the team’s offensive surge to close the set. Up 15-12, Taylor’s attack sparked Hawaii’s 10-1 run to win the game’s first set, taking the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the one-set deficit, UCSB continued to trade points with Hawaii in the opening of the second set. Yet, tied 7-7, Santa Barbra’s inability to limit its self-inflicted mistakes contributed to the Rainbow Wahine having a match-best .452 hitting clip. Hawaii surely benefited from its attacking success as it went on two 6-0 runs, the second scoring spurt gave the Rainbow Wahine a 23-12 lead. Helping capture the 25-14 set win were two kills by junior setter Tayler Higgins and sophomore middle hitter Emily Maglio.</p>\n<p>UCSB remained motivated in its quest to trim Hawaii’s lead. While the Gauchos’ ongoing errors persisted in the match’s last set, their offense improved to a team-high .258 hitting percentage. Three different Gauchos tallied a total of six kills, while sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman led UCSB in kills for the fourth straight match with seven.</p>\n<p>Still, Hawaii’s outstanding hitting stretch continued as it registered a .433 clip. Leading the Rainbow Wahine was an imposing performance by Higgins. Last week’s espnW Player of the Week, Higgins tallied a match-high 14 kills to go along with a .464 hitting night.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii outhit UCSB, freshman libero Emilia Petrachi logged a match-high 19 digs. However, it was Santa Barbara’s insufficiency at the net that plagued its defense. While UCSB had no blocking errors, the Gauchos blocked just six of Hawaii’s attacking attempts. Not only were the Rainbow Wahine able to capitalize offensively, but they also strived on defense with a total of 19 blocks. In addition to Maglio’s eight kills and .615 hitting clip, she notched a match-high of six blocks to help Hawaii win the final set, 25-19.</p>\n<p>Certainly the Rainbow Wahines’ performance on both sides of the net must be acknowledged, but UCSB’s errors proved too costly against a powerhouse program like Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I think Hawaii is a great team. They have no real weakness and they had a huge size advantage on us,” Lantagne Welch said. “I actually thought we played better than the score indicated. If you hit .300 against just about any team you’re gonna win. We just didn’t put enough pressure on them or their offense. We didn’t serve tough at all and we let them off the hook that way.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to the Thunderdome this Friday, Oct. 2nd to host its conference home opener versus Cal State Northridge at 7:00 p.m. UCSB continues its home stand with a match versus No. 25 Long Beach State on Saturday, Oct. 3rd at 7:00 p.m. as well.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/","id":5097,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5096,5095,5094],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Goes For Six Straight Games Saturday Vs.

We were all really confident so hopefully we will continue to win against Hawaii on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>When Hawaii comes to town, it will bring with it one of the most outstanding offensive duos in the country in sophomore attacker Paula Chillida Esforzado and senior utility Danielle Lewis. Esforzado leads her team both in goals (38) and assists (29) in just 19 games while Lewis has scored 37 goals on a team-high 49.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re really hoping to play very similar to what we did last weekend,” sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw said. “We’re a super young team and we were kind of scattered at the beginning of the year but now we’re all developing and knowing each other’s strengths so we can work together really well. We’re excited.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense has carried them in the last month. After allowing over 9.1 goals per game through their first 16 games, the Gauchos have decreased that number down to just 4.6 per game in their last five wins.</p>\n<p>“We want to play exactly how we played against Davis. That was our best game by far and if we continue to play like that then we shouldn’t have a problem beating Hawaii,” Smith said. “Each game we play we hit another milestone, and every game we get a little bit better. We’re just continuing to progress and that’s really exciting to be able to watch the team change and see that all the hard work is paying off.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Hawaii this Saturday at noon at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54576\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54576\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-goes-for-six-straight-games-saturday-vs-hawaii/","id":5094,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5093,5092,5091],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Hawaii in Conference Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB dropped its second match of the Big West portion of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After riding a four-game winning streak into the weekend, the UCSB women’s water polo team fell short against No. 9 Hawaii in its tightly contested Big West home opener.

The Rainbow Wahine scored four goals in the first period compared to three by UCSB and eventually took a 7-4 lead into the half.</p>\n<p>After a disappointing first half defensively, the Gauchos put together their most impressive defensive half of the season.</p>\n<p>“In the second half our defense was really strong. We were all working really well together,” sophomore utility Holly Smith said. “That was the strongest defense we’ve played thus far this season. A lot of people stepped up, and Miranda Schrader and Jenna Solberg scored vital goals.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defensive intensity rose to another level in the second half and trailed by just two after outscoring Hawaii 2-1 in the third quarter. The Gauchos were able to score another goal in the fourth quarter, cutting the lead to 8-7.</p>\n<p>“Our defense really stepped it up and we all really clicked in the third and fourth,” Hudson said. “We all rallied and came together. We are super young and just getting better every single game.”</p>\n<p>Trailing by one goal in the final seconds of regulation, UCSB was denied on two separate point-blank chances by Hawaii’s senior goalie Amy Carlson, preserving the win for the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>“We were very disappointed to lose this game but it showed us exactly what we need to improve on and how we can take on the coming teams,” Smith said. “We are confident going into our next game because each game we’re continuing to improve and working together really well.”</p>\n<p>With just three more conference games remaining this season, the Gauchos will now look forward to a match with No. 6 UC Irvine Anteaters, the team tied atop the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We learned a lot from this loss,” Hudson said. “If we run into Hawaii at [the Big West Championships], it’ll definitely be a different outcome.”</p>\n<p>The match with Irvine will begin at noon this Saturday at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54676\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54676\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/","id":5095,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5094,5093,5092],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose Third Straight Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=826%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to UC Irvine 6-3 and Long beach State 9-5.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team entered the weekend disappointed about a home loss to No. 9 Hawaii the prior week and failed to redeem itself after falling to UC Irvine in a 6-3 loss on Saturday.

Long Beach split its two games by losing to Northridge and defeating the Gauchos and is now 18-9 overall and 2-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“At this point our confidence level is pretty high,” sophomore utility Jessie Porter said. “We know we can play with any of the other teams in Big West and give them a good game.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In Saturday’s game against the Anteaters, the Gauchos fell behind early due to a lack of offensive flow.</p>\n<p>“We needed to improve on our shots,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “We didn’t score at all until the second half, but we were able to close the gap to just three goals. Next time we need to make our goals from the start so we don’t get behind.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was finally able to break the seal on the goal in the fourth quarter when freshman attacker Taylor Shore put in a goal, but the 5-0 deficit through three periods was too big a deficit to come back from.</p>\n<p>Freshman and sophomore attackers Carly Christian and Bryn Hudson also added goals in the final period, but the Gauchos fell short by a final of 6-3.</p>\n<p>Getting the start at goalkeeper for UCSB was freshman Nikki Quinn, who put together a good effort with six saves as she and the rest of the defense held the Anteaters well under their season scoring average.</p>\n<p>“We actually did play well today,” Martin said. “During the first half we were communicating pretty well on defense. We drew a lot of ejections and we were working well as a team, but the shots that we took were not going in. Our offense in our 6-on-5 needs to improve because we made all three goals from a man up.”</p>\n<p>In their road match against Long Beach State on Sunday, the Gauchos came out with a little more offensive firepower, scoring two goals in the first half. However, the 49ers took a 4-2 lead into halftime thanks to a dominant performance by senior defender Coriann Snyder, who ended the game with a hat trick.</p>\n<p>“Today I felt our defense was our strong point even though the score didn’t show that,” Porter said. “What could have been better was our communication on both ends of the pool.”</p>\n<p>The third period saw the least amount of defense from both teams as Long Beach senior attacker Chelsea Parks put in a pair of goals to match UCSB’s two third quarter goals. Trailing 8-4 heading into the final frame, the Gauchos ran out of time on their way to a 9-5 loss.</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Samantha Murphy led UCSB with two goals against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>With just one game remaining in the regular season against No. 7 Cal State Northridge, the Gauchos aren’t worried about a 1-3 record in Big West games at this point.</p>\n<p>“We are confident that we will do well,” Martin said. “Everyone for the most part is pretty even. Going into conference we need to have the mindset that we have nothing to lose and we definitely have the potential to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home for its final match of the regular season against Northridge at 4 p.m. on Friday in Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/","id":5096,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5095,5094,5093],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
