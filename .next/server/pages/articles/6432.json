Over the span of a lifetime, we will all follow rules, take risks and develop strategies in order to reach our endgame. However, we’re only human. And sometimes, we get so caught up in the competition that we forget to enjoy the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we enter a new stage in our life, college is a time when it seems like we have to learn the rules all over again. Halfway through my third year at UCSB, I can say with certainty that, although I have a better understanding of the rules, the game itself is no less challenging because of it. As we are presented with more opportunities — opportunities to make new connections, join different organizations, pursue new leadership roles or take on a job or internship — the pressure builds. How do I do it all? How do I do it all with a full course load? How do I do it all while maintaining some form of a social life — and does sitting across from my friends in silence in the library count?</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86460\" style=\"width: 534px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86460\" data-attachment-id=\"86460\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-02/the-game-of-life-why-you-should-play-by-your-own-rules/game-of-life-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/game-of-life-art-e1551220614642.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"game of life art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/game-of-life-art-e1551220614642.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/game-of-life-art-e1551220614642.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86460\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/game-of-life-art-e1551220614642.jpg?resize=524%2C524\" alt=\"\" width=\"524\" height=\"524\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86460\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kate Ryan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming in as a freshman, wide-eyed and ready for new experiences, I decided to go through sorority recruitment because it seemed like the perfect way to meet new people and make a large school feel a little bit smaller.

Unfortunately for me, there was no instruction manual to be seen. Over the course of that week, I eventually came to the conclusion that I possessed the physical allure and social graces of a potato. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than halfway done with college and the threat of entering the “Real World” on the horizon, I’m realizing how, although the board may continuously change, the nature of the game always seems to stay the same. Comparing preference night outfits and bids are a thing of the past —  irrelevant and juvenile, even. Now the stakes suddenly seem more real when I instead find myself comparing summer plans and LinkedIn profiles. Another friend has just landed the internship of his dreams, but I still have no idea what I’m doing this summer. What am I lacking? Am I falling behind? No one wants to be a sore loser and, at your core, you know that’s not who you are because you still feel genuinely happy for him. But being happy for your friend’s success isn’t enough to stop the sinking feeling in your stomach.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may not be able to control the external pressures of society but we can ease the burden by choosing not to add to the weight ourselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In times of stress and uncertainty, I’ve found that for most people, it’s almost impossible not to compare yourself to those around you. Maybe we start out looking for guidance or reassurance that other people feel just as lost as we do. Other times, we use our peers as markers to measure our achievements, or lack thereof. Although habits like these are hard to break, the longer we allow ourselves to stay in this mentality of constant comparison, the more we’ll hurt ourselves in the end. After all, when you’re competing against the world, you’re rarely going to come out on top.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We may not be able to control the external pressures of society — pressures to excel at academics and extracurriculars, pressures from family members and friends — but we can ease the burden by choosing not to add to the weight ourselves. Much of the stress, anxiety and despair we feel comes from trying in vain to meet unrealistic expectations created by our perceptions of others. Despite convincing outward appearances, no one has their whole life figured out. Although it can be easy to be consumed by the desire to keep up with our peers and “do it all,” doing so will only lead to an inevitable spiral of negativity and self-doubt. Instead, take a step back and choose a different path for yourself. Your success doesn’t have to be measured by someone else’s. Although humans may be competitive by nature, remember: the game of life doesn’t have to be a competition.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu wants you to take a deep breath — you’re doing great!</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

Even if you claim that drunk you is just an enhanced version of normal you, reevaluate how awesome you really are, and take into account that you may or may not be completely batshit crazy.</p>\n<p>But you know that awkward moment when you feel like you’ve taken up celibacy as your inadvertent New Year’s resolution? That’s a dangerous moment. That is when you may or may not start booty calling your friends, because you’re calling them anyway, and you’re walkin’ around with a conviction to slay that cannot be matched, and boom. Friend zone has turned to complete and utter shit. Welcome to the “I’ve seen you naked and can fully access this image in my mind whenever I want to” zone.</p>\n<p>The awkward conversation that goes down in the morning when you’ve hooked up with one of your friends is horrendous. “So what are you doing today?” “Probably going home and showering and um, hanging out here.” Because shit, all of a sudden you realize that you spend 98 percent of your time with this person and you’re fucked. Literally and freshly. See you later/tonight/at that party/in class/for that dinner I planned to cook you before I knew we were going to wrestle naked. Yeah. Hashtag that shit.</p>\n<p>The other horrible forced booty call is when all of a sudden at 1:49 in the morning you remember you left a ladle or something equally as useless at someone’s house that you’re trying to hook up with. All of a sudden it’s as if the world will stop turning if you can’t make a very complicated (from scratch) soup recipe rightfuckingnow. If you finally convince them to let your drunk ass into their house, be prepared to be shown the door and to please walk out it so that you don’t become a stage five lingerer. If they saw this opportunity in the same way you did, they probably would’ve made a really bad sexual joke with the word ladle in it. God, I really wish I didn’t pick ladle for this example.</p>\n<p>Everyone loves receiving booty calls for the same reason: the predictability of seeing that name flash on your screen and (regardless of the gender) thinking, “Ha. This bitch.” Tell me that’s not the first thought that pops into your head. Get at me, bro.</p>\n<p>Just make sure not to train your tired fingers to text back “I’m down” as your go-to late night response. While this may be appropriate when hitting up late night nachos (which is also not the greatest idea), there’s nothing worse than falling back to sleep and finding out the next morning that your booty caller showed up and you were passed the fuck out.</p>\n<p>Be wary of making the mistake of not checking to make sure you have all of the necessary words in your text. Response to a joke: Are you fucking with me right now? Take out the word “with”, and, well … Shit. Just. Got. Weird.</p>\n<p>And finally, always keep in mind that everything in I.V. tends to come full circle. With house hunting going on, you never know if your booty call may end up moving in next door.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks says there are exceptions to the post-10 p.m. rule of thumb:. Namely Extravaganza and Floatopia, where the drunk texting grace period begins at 11 a.m. and continues through the following day.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/","id":6429,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6428,6427,6426],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"More Than Friends, Less Than Fun","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Aristotle once said, “Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.” A poetic, moving assessment, but I have to wonder: Did Aristotle ever decide to fuck one of these friends he was renting ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Aristotle once said, “Friendship is a single soul dwelling in<br>\ntwo bodies.” A poetic, moving assessment, but I have to wonder:<br>\nDid Aristotle ever decide to fuck one of these friends he<br>\nwas renting half of his soul out to?

Must we have our friends and eat them out<br>\ntoo?<br>\nIt’s a grey area, a sexual limbo of sorts. If he’s having a bad<br>\nday, you’re not sure if you should give him a hug or head. And<br>\nif it’s that time of the month, you don’t know whether to lend<br>\nher some Advil or ask her if she’s down anyway. It’s a danger<br>\nzone, people, and it ain’t easy getting out of it.<br>\nThe alleged “benefit” of having a friend with benefits is<br>\nsexual stimulation and release without the responsibilities of<br>\nan emotional relationship — which generally implies sacrifice<br>\nof self, commitment, emotional exchange and of course,<br>\nmonogamy. You may be thinking: “I can get my dick wet with<br>\nsomeone I like hanging out with, no attachment necessary?<br>\nWhat’s the catch?” Answer: Contrary to the popular belief<br>\nthat you have a cock for a brain, you’re a human with feelings.<br>\nSorry to pop your “I’m so strong I can fuck like a primal beast<br>\nprogrammed to inseminate without attachment” cherry, but<br>\nwith coitus comes closeness. No ifs, ands or best friends’ butts<br>\nabout it.<br>\nSo what are we so afraid of that we opt for the nearest<br>\nphysical contact over a committed relationship? Well, let’s look<br>\nat what a relationship entails: couple-y activities, pillow talk,<br>\nfamily functions, calling the morning after, stress, making<br>\nplans for the future, moving into the out-loud farting zone, oh<br>\ndear this sounds horrible. Okay, okay; you win. Pal pooning<br>\ndefinitely takes the prize. Just do me a favor and be cautious<br>\nof which homedogs you’re dogging.<br>\nBottom line, if you are comfortable enough to consider<br>\nsomeone a good friend, then you are vulnerable enough<br>\naround them to give in emotionally. This is not to say that<br>\nbeautiful, healthy relationships can’t form out of friendships.<br>\nOn the contrary, they do all the time. My point is in the distinction<br>\nbetween building a sexual relationship and fucking.<br>\nYou can date a buddy you have sex with, but it just doesn’t<br>\nwork with a fuck buddy. See the difference?<br>\nHaving a secret crush on someone you’re already sleeping<br>\nwith is dangerous territory. It’s like craving your favorite food<br>\nwhile you’re chewing it — seriously confusing. It doesn’t take<br>\na Facebook update to know that if it feels complicated, it’s<br>\ncomplicated, even if “casually fucking my friend” isn’t a relationship<br>\nstatus as of yet.<br>\nSo why fuel the friendly fling fire? Two options: This<br>\nperson either secretly loves you and wants to use sexual intimacy<br>\nas a crutch on the way to something more serious, or is<br>\na commitment-phobe and wants to use your body as a hollow<br>\nshell to fuck his/her problems away. Do yourself a favor and<br>\nstep away from the insecure trap of loneliness and draw the<br>\nline between people you hang with and people you bang with.<br>\nMy advice: Become friends with the people you fuck, not<br>\nthe other way around. And to all of you strangers out there<br>\nwho have “friended” me, take note on where I stand.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36256\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-03/friends-fun-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36256\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-03/friends-fun-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-03/friends-fun-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-03/friends-fun-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-03/friends-fun-2/","id":6430,"author":{"id":351,"name":"Multimedia Editor"},"related":[6429,6428,6427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Healthcare in College is a Total Headache","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opinion Editor Hannah Jackson dissects the difficulty of dealing with medical side effects while also being a full-time student.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pain was blinding and seemingly came out of nowhere.

However, more serious migraines have made it so that at times I am on the verge of vomiting, sensitive to the faintest light, sound or smell and even partly lose the ability to see.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86729\" style=\"width: 349px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86729\" data-attachment-id=\"86729\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/healthcare-in-college-is-a-total-headache/opinionhealthcare-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?fit=2000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"OpinionHealthCare-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86729\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01-250x250.png?resize=339%2C339\" alt=\"\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OpinionHealthCare-01.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86729\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elaborate new treatments for migraines are always popping up, with tantalizing FDA-approved labels and seductive promises of reduced and less severe headache days. Sometimes, the treatments seem ridiculous: Botox injections to the head, menthol-infused patches, weird-looking headbands that contain electrodes. But recently, when the FDA approved one out of just three injectable migraine drugs on the market, I immediately knew that I wanted to get my hands on it.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To absolutely nobody’s surprise, the American healthcare system is a dense jungle of red tape, and getting a prescription for the injectable medication turned out to be borderline impossible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You aren’t a good candidate for this drug,” my neurologist told me, as he handed me a prescription for an anti-seizure drug called Topamax instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You haven’t tried enough medications for your insurance company to cover this one,” which essentially meant that if I wanted the injection, I would have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket every month  — just to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potentially </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel okay. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus began yet another seemingly endless trial-and-error run with a foreign medication, and for the third year in a row, I resigned myself to physical pain and chemical cocktails, hoping that the side effects wouldn’t be all-consuming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This fear of side effects didn’t emerge from nowhere; it had happened before and I was positive that it could happen again. During my freshman year of college, I switched brands of birth control from a standard 21-days-on/seven-days-off cycle to one that increased my hormone levels every week —  dually managing to make my painful periods even worse </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slamming me with a blindsiding depression.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent the first two quarters of my second year in a tailspin. Crying fits would spring up out of nowhere and an increasingly volatile relationship with the person I had considered my best friend was making it all the worse. It took until spring break to admit to myself that what had once been rattled off as a potential side effect had grown into an autonomous beast, encompassing my entire existence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My personal experience with Prozac has been ideal. On the first sunny day, a few weeks into spring quarter, I found myself imbued with a newfound appreciation for life and sat on the Arbor lawn for over an hour basking in my gratitude. While that initial burst of euphoria doesn’t last forever, Prozac has done wonders in anchoring me to the world — a trait that was very much appreciated when a death in the family during spring quarter hit and I realized that had I not been on antidepressants, my grief would have been exponentially more explosive.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To absolutely nobody’s surprise, the American healthcare system is a dense jungle of red tape, and getting a prescription for the injectable medication turned out to be borderline impossible.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every experience can be as simple and as painless as my trial with Prozac, which was ironically needed to curb a side effect gone rogue. The migraine medication I take now, Topamax, has catapulted both my body and my mind through a never-ending loop of misery: numbness of the extremities, indigestion so severe that I can barely stomach any food that isn’t unexciting and bland, severe dehydration, tiredness, sluggishness, nervousness, loss of appetite, weight loss. But worst of all, beyond any of the frustrating physical symptoms, is what it has done to my mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being on an anti-seizure medication inhibits brain function and having this knowledge is infuriating when there isn’t a damn thing to do about it. I can feel my thoughts forming slowly, like a late 90s computer would load a webpage on Internet Explorer. I feel myself slipping academically, and I have to consciously choose whether or not to produce my optimal standard of work or open myself up to the possibility of earth-shattering migraines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no support available for these kinds of problems in university because, quite frankly, there is nothing to be done. Healthcare is a personal choice to make and ultimately, I am the only person who can decide for myself if these horrible side effects are worth the head-splitting pain I’ve experienced on a weekly basis for the past twelve years of my life. And I still don’t know. That being said though, dealing with side effects that affect academic performance is an incredibly isolating experience — especially when the typical response from friends, counselors, TAs, doctors and professors alike is, “Wow, that sucks.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiencing medical crises or medication-induced side effects that have impacted my academic career has been a lonely experience. Friends who do not experience similar health issues rarely sympathize, and I have regularly feared that sharing these problems with my TAs and professors will mark me as a complainer, an excuse-maker or someone who just isn’t trying hard enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be there for the people in your life who are facing academic struggles due to health problems. Make an effort to get dinner with them, plan study dates, or even just ask them how they’re </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doing</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Feeling like a stranger in your own body is jarring enough, and the added stress of falling behind in school can only make your sense of self more removed. While it’s certainly nobody else’s job or obligation to deal with that, having a good support system makes an insurmountable difference. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Jackson wants to hear something better than, “Wow, that sucks.” </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
