Despite an incredible second-half comeback, the fact of the matter remains that the UCSB women’s basketball team lost 58-57 to UC Davis in the first round of the Big West Tournament tonight and its season is done.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of this team,” Mitchell said. “That was not an 8-22 team that just ended those last 20 minutes.”</p>\n<p>All season long, the thorn in Santa Barbara’s side has been consistency. 20 minutes of solid basketball isn’t enough and it came back to bite the eighth-seed Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After starting the game 3-7 from the field, UCSB began settling for too many jumpers against the Aggies’ zone defense. With the score tied at nine, Davis went on a 12-0 run, which was extended to 19 points with less than a minute to go before halftime. After its solid start, Santa Barbara shot just 5-23 the rest of the half.</p>\n<p>“100 percent [it was a matter of settling for too many jumpers],” Mitchell said. “I think once one or two didn’t fall, they continued to show that we could get in a flow with the jumpers.”</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms down 35-18, the Gauchos mounted a comeback. Led by the three seniors, guards Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason, the lead was chopped to four points with 13:10 to go.</p>\n<p>“It were no x’s and o’s (at halftime),” Mitchell said. “I just told them that actions speak louder than words. You can look in people’s eyes sometimes and know whether they’re going to come back out and battle or whether they’re ready to call it quits. Not once this year have these guys ever given in.”</p>\n<p>Play on both ends of the floor was nearly flawless. While UCSB has struggled this season defensively at times, any team under Mitchell prides itself on its defense. Using its press, Santa Barbara forced the Aggies into 11 second-half turnovers, which resulted in 24 points on the other end. In total, the Gauchos held UCD to 23 points in the final 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Our focus is always defense,” Zornig said. “Coach Mitch told us not to worry about the scoring and just to focus on the defense. In the second half, we came out with so much energy. We pressed them and trapped them and caused them to force turnovers. Our defense got us back in the game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also aided by the fact that sophomore forward Alyson Doherty went down with an injury approximately midway through the second half. She was unable to return after posting 14 points.</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB tallied 39 second-half points, shooting a phenomenal 60.7 percent from the field by attacking and getting to the rim. All season long, the seniors have put the team on their backs, but they took the saying to a new level last night, totaling every single point Santa Barbara scored in the second half.</p>\n<p>Zornig led the team with 21 points on 9-15 shooting while Mason added 16 points on 8-13 shooting. Nesbit also contributed 16 points.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been talking about how it’s March Madness. It’s one and done,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, it took us until the second half to get that run going, but we knew that if we didn’t give it all we had, we’d be going home.”</p>\n<p>With just under two minutes to play, Davis’ lead had been sliced to one at 56-55 by a layup from Mason in transition.</p>\n<p>“[It] was a really exciting basketball game,” UC Davis Head Coach Jennifer Gross said. “I thought we came our tremendously in the first half with great energy, executed offensively and played some of the best defense we’ve played this year, but we knew Santa Barbara wasn’t going away. They have tremendous players. I wasn’t surprised when they got it going.”</p>\n<p>However, with 65 seconds left, Zornig was called for an offensive foul. Mitchell, a coach not known for jabbing at the referees, immediately headed toward the nearest official. She was immediately given a technical foul, which resulted in two free throws for Davis on the other end, both of which were converted.</p>\n<p>“I’m disappointed for the seniors that they had to go out this way. I’ve already apologized to them,” Mitchell said. “It’s something I can’t take back; I can’t give them another game. Would we have won? I don’t know. I think at some point, you want the players to know you have their back and I just voiced it too loud in a critical moment in the game.”</p>\n<p>Rather than trying to tie the game with a three, Nesbit attacked, making a layup to bring the game within one once again at 58-57. On the other end, Santa Barbara earned the stop it needed defensively, causing a 30 second shot clock violation on Davis, but that left UCSB with just 4.0 seconds.</p>\n<p>Needing to go the length of the court, the Gauchos found their quickest player, Jemerigbe. In the short amount of time remaining, Jemerigbe was able to get all the way to the right elbow before she was forced to throw up the runner. It bounced off the back of the iron, sending UCSB home.</p>\n<p>“They did a good job trying to deny Nic and Mel,” Mitchell said. “We were trying to get it across half court and [run] a quick play. It is what it is and it’s never the last play that wins or loses the game.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ends its season at 8-22 overall and 3-14 in Big West play. UC Davis, meanwhile, improves to 15-15 overall and will play UC Irvine in the quarterfinals tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“I can’t say enough about their players. Their seniors in particular were exceptional tonight,” Gross said. “We beat a very, very good basketball team tonight. The records don’t show a whole lot in our conference. Whether you have three or ten losses, every game is a battle. We knew regardless of record, we were playing a tough team today.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/","id":520,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[519,518,517],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Porter Etches Name in UCSB and Big West History in UCSB Quarterfinal Win Over UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-1.48.07-PM.png?resize=798%2C402&ssl=1","description":"Big-time player show up in big-time games.

Porter attempted and made each of her field goals from beyond the arc, going 9-of-11 from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The nine made three-pointers also set a new program single-game record, surpassing former Gaucho Erin Alexander’s previous mark of eight.</p>\n<p>UCSB has made at least eight three-pointers in four consecutive games.</p>\n<p>Porter scored 20 of her 31 points in the first quarter. Whether when coming off screens, off the dribble or even contested, Porter’s hot shooting hand was consistent as she made 6-of-6 three-pointers and two free-throws in the game’s first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Balancing Porter’s three-point shooting was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a dominant performance in the paint. For a third time this season, Edelman tied her career-high of 22 points. Also, Edelman’s game-high 14 rebounds led to her tallying her eighth double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Signs of Porter’s career night began with her scoring the game’s first basket form long range. From that point on, both teams exchanged scores. Responding on UCR’s behalf was Malou Thiebaut De Kergret with a made three-pointer to give the Highlanders a 10-8 lead. The sophomore forward had 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting before fouling out later on.</p>\n<p>The one-point deficit was the last time UCSB trailed before responding with a 15-0 run. Sparking the run was Porter with her third-straight three-pointer at the 4:53 mark of the first. The Gauchos’ lead increased from a layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler to 23-10, leading to UCR calling a timeout as it had been held scoreless for a little over five minutes.</p>\n<p>Toler concluded Wednesday night with 13 points, eight assists, and two steals.</p>\n<p>Breaking the Highlanders’ scoring slump was a jumpshot by junior guard Michelle Curry. Junior guard Lauren Holt scored on UCR’s next possession to cut their deficit to single digits at 14-23.</p>\n<p>But another three-pointer by Porter in the final five second of the first quarter gave UCSB a 26-14 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being down to start the second quarter, Curry took matters into her own hands, embarking on an individual 8-2 run that cut UCSB’s lead to 28-22. She scored 11 of her team-high 22 points in the period.</p>\n<p>Although Riverside managed to contain Porter’s perimeter shooting during the quarter, holding her to just one missed shot attempt, UCSB responded with a 7-2 run of its own. The scoring stretch built its lead to 35-24.</p>\n<p>UCR cut the Gaucho’s lead to a five-point deficit three times during the period as a made free-throw by Curry left the Highlanders down 37-42 entering halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 40-26 advantage in both rebounds and points in the paint. The outcome of both values led to Edelman’s big night, which picked up at the start of the second half as she scored the Gauchos first six points of the third.</p>\n<p>Still, the Highlanders continued to claw away at Santa Barbara’s lead. After Curry’s jumpshot brought UCR within three at 48-51 before a layup by UCSB’s Toler, Kergret knocked down a three-pointer on Riverside’s next possession that resulted in a 51-53 deficit with 4:49 remaining in the third.</p>\n<p>As UCSB was in a position of possibly losing its lead, emerging was Porter from beyond the arc to give it a 56-51 lead. Igniting the Gaucho’s 11-4 run to end the period was a three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. Toler scored the team’s last field goal with a layup, helping UCSB enter the fourth with a 67-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Similar to how the game began, Edelman and Porter scored UCSB’s first points in the game’s final period to put the Gauchos up 72-61.</p>\n<p>Porter scored her coveted ninth three-pointer of the game with 5:18 remaining, giving UCSB a 77-63 lead. Both teams would end up trading baskets and taking trips to the free-throw line with Edelman scoring the Gauchos’ last field goal of the game to eventually lock up their victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Davis this Friday, March 10 in the semifinal round of the Big West Tournament at noon.

The Gauchos, however, dropped a game at UC Irvine last Thursday, a victory which propelled the Anteaters to first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>While UCSB clinched a position in the conference tournament long ago, the team’s seeding is still in question. Theoretically, the Gauchos could finish with anywhere from the No. 1 to No. 4 seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have to take care of business, we feel this week, because you never know. We think Irvine has a tough game with Fullerton on Thursday,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “You never know what can happen, and we do not want to live with the what-if scenario and we need to win a game this week to assure the No. 2 seed.”</p>\n<p>Leading the effort to regain momentum entering the tournament is junior center Alan ‘Big Al’ Williams. Big Al ranks eighth in the nation in scoring and is second in the country in rebounds per game. Against Hawaii, Big Al powered the Gauchos with game-highs of 20 points and 17 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Equally as impressive has been the play of junior point guard Zalmico Harmon, who ranks second in the nation in assist to turnover ratio as well as second in the conference in assists per game.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will certainly present a challenge to the Gauchos, both down low and on the perimeter. Senior forward Christian Standhardinger is one of the premier big men in the conference, ranking fifth in points and rebounds per game in the conference. Sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Freshman of the Year, ranks 10th in the conference in points and rebounds, giving the Rainbow Warriors a talented low post combo.</p>\n<p>“We actually feel Fotu and Standhardinger are the best 5-4 combo in the league because they do everything,” Coach Williams said. “These two, they have to carry the heavy load scoring, they have to carry the heavy load rebounding and they defend the other team’s bigs, obviously. I think these two kids have as big an impact as any two kids on any team in the league.”</p>\n<p>As for the two Gaucho seniors who will be honored tonight, both have had important impacts on the team both on the court and off the court.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot, these guys have put in so much work into the program. It’s a huge thing for us to be able to get our seniors out of here on a good note,” Big Al said. “We definitely want a lot of fan support because we want to send our seniors out right. If we can get everybody to the game, it’d be really awesome. It’s a televised ESPNU game, big time game for us and we want everybody to be there to support us.”</p>\n<p>Boswell ranks third in UCSB history in three-pointers made, finishing last season as the Big West Sixth Man of the Year and All-Big West Honorable Mention. This past week, the mechanical engineering major was named as UCSB’s male Big West Scholar of the Year for the second consecutive time.</p>\n<p>“Kyle is one of the all-time three-point leaders in our school’s history,” Coach Williams said. “He’s a guy, in the last two years, has drawn an awful lot of attention from everybody we’ve played. People try to make sure that Bos doesn’t get an open look.”</p>\n<p>Moore began his career as a transfer walk-on player last season before earning a scholarship this past season. The forward certainly produced both on the court with his physical and smart play, and in the classroom as he will secure his degree this spring.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting because it’s nice to be honored and I get to do it with my best friend here, my roommate (Boswell),” Moore said. “But it’s a little sad, we’ve been here so long and spent so much time in this gym that it’s a little sad, it’s bittersweet. I think that we’re pretty focused to win. Last two games, senior night, it’s something that you have to win on.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 6 p.m. at the Thunderdome. The game will be broadcasted on ESPNU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54387\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54387\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/","id":518,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[517,516,515],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Arrested Following Confrontation With Hawaii Coach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PART_1394243031794_IMG952090.jpg.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PART_1394243031794_IMG952090.jpg.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is receiving negative attention following an incident at Thursday night's men's basketball game.

Instead of the Gauchos’ victory garnering attention, UCSB is receiving national coverage for an incident of a UCSB student running onto the court and confronting Hawaii head coach Gib Arnold.</p>\n<p>With UCSB leading 30-16 with 6:02 remaining in the first half, Hawaii senior guard Brandon Spearman was assessed a technical foul for complaining to officials. Arnold then rushed to half-court to argue with referees before being restrained by a Hawaii player, receiving a technical foul in the process.</p>\n<p>That is when the student rushed onto the court, angrily confronting Arnold and yelling in the coach’s face. Hawaii players Christian Standhardinger and Garrett Nevels quickly pushed the fan away before anything else happened. The fan backpedaled to his seat, gesturing for Hawaii players to come after him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I apologized to Hawaii during the game, I apologized to Gib at halftime. He came over to me and we chatted,” UCSB head coach Bob Williams said. “I apologized to the officials, they should never have to deal with anything like that.”</p>\n<p>The student returned to his midcourt seat in student section, high-fiving friends in the vicinity. Bob Brontsema, Assistant Athletics Director of Events, Facilities and Operations immediately followed the student into the stands, calmly escorting the student out of the Thunderdome without using force. The student complied, grabbing his jacket before receiving a few high-fives as he walked out of the arena.</p>\n<p>Following his ejection, the student was arrested by campus police and spent the night in a local police holding cell before friends picked him up Friday morning. The student was wearing a navy UCSB Class of 2014 shirt, and was yelling and jumping up and down throughout the duration of the first half, obviously excited about the game.</p>\n<p>“It’s embarrassing. That’s a bad foot to be putting forward that represents all of UCSB,” Williams said. “That’s just wrong. Flat out wrong and it should never happen.”</p>\n<p>According to Bill Mahoney, Assistant Athletics Director of Communications, the student will face disciplinary action from the university following a hearing from Judicial Affairs, one of the possible actions being expulsion.</p>\n<p>Many members of the UCSB Athletics Department expressed regret at the conclusion of the game regarding the embarrassment UCSB would receive from the actions of this one student.</p>\n<p>This incident certainly placed a negative light on UCSB, with the story receiving national attention, including a headline on the front page of ESPN.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-student-confronts-hawaii-coach/","id":519,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[518,517,516],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
