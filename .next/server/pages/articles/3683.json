In addition to the 35 residential burglaries in the month of July, the IVFP also received 28 reports of miscellaneous burglary and two reports of auto burglary, Vuillemainroy said.</p>\n<p>“The biggest crimes we have been seeing this summer are burglaries,” Vuillemainroy said. “A lot of this happens while kids are out partying and having fun, forgetting to lock their doors and take their keys. … Students need to make sure that they have the keys to their residences every time they leave in order to prevent crime.”</p>\n<p>One of the first burglaries of the month took place on July 3, when a victim awoke to the sound of footsteps in his apartment on the 800 block of Embarcadero del Norte. The resident saw a thief using the light of a cell phone to navigate the apartment before making off with a flat screen television and a computer.</p>\n<p>Similar incidents continued throughout the month, including an instance of thieves striking two apartments in the same building on the 900 block of Camino del Sur.</p>\n<p>In addition to investigating residential burglaries, Foot Patrol deputies also responded to several violent crimes during the month of July, including two cases of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Foot Patrol officers were called to the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive on July 25 after a 19-year-old man reportedly raped a woman. Vuillemainroy said the survivor was assaulted after her roommates had allowed the man into their apartment.</p>\n<p>“He then stepped into the woman’s bedroom where he forcibly raped her,” Vuillemainroy said. “She yelled for help and her roommates rushed to her and pulled him off.”</p>\n<p>Authorities later identified and arrested the man in an in-field line-up.</p>\n<p>Other cases of physical assault were reported, including an incident on the evening of July 24 where three men harassed people with a stun gun at three separate parties.</p>\n<p>“The men were threatening to stun people with a stun gun,” Vuillemainroy said. “One person was actually stunned but is okay now.”</p>\n<p>Authorities successfully arrested the assailants.</p>\n<p>Deputies also responded to a standard number of vandalisms and alcohol-related crimes during July. Officers wrote 28 drunk in public citations during the month and took reports of nine vandalisms.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Zaveeni Khan-Marcus, who has been the director for the MultiCultural Center (MCC) since its founding, is the “heart and soul” of the center, according to Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life.</p>\n<p>Armistead works with the center in an administrative capacity and has known Khan-Marcus since they were both undergraduate students at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), when the center was first introduced.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of history with Zaveeni and I and with me watching the center grow,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>The MCC was a small room on the other side of campus when it was first founded in 1987 after students of color protested their lack of inclusion within the university. When the University Center expansion was commissioned in 1994, the organization’s current space by Ortega Dining Commons was created.</p>\n<p>Now the center holds a theater, a meeting room and lounge. While the MCC has suffered from limited funding, it has been able to maintain its 24-25 programs each quarter while also increasing the scale on which it operates.</p>\n<p>“Last quarter, we had Kimberle Crenshaw who gave a talk at Campbell Hall, and even though Campbell Hall holds only about 800 seats, we had 1,200 people who showed up for that event,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>She sees this as tangible proof there is demand, and an expectation, for the MCC to continue to host speakers or put on events that create a “platform for conversation about race, class, social justice [and] equality.”</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also works with faculty to create awareness on campus; some faculty members even offer extra credit to students who attend these events.</p>\n<p>The spaces within the MCC are also open to cultural organizations affiliated with the center, which often host meetings or events there.</p>\n<p>“We provide opportunities for UCSB students [to immerse themselves in] other cultural experiences. MCC is definitely the best place to provide such international and cultural communications,” said Takafumi Igarashi, director of social activities for the International Student Association.</p>\n<p>Beyond its existence as an event space, the MCC is focused on giving voice to students.</p>\n<p>“Throughout our 30-year existence currently, centralizing the students is one of the most important things we do,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>The MCC is led by a board of students, staff and faculty. Student representatives come from various cultural organizations that are affiliated with the center.</p>\n<p>“They come together and they have conversations, inform us about what their needs are, but also represent to the campus the needs of … the marginalized students,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>These students are able to have challenging conversations and come together to support each other and advance student activism during a difficult campus climate, according to Armistead.</p>\n<p>While the MCC is typically known as a home away from home for students of color, the center has also opened itself up to transgender students on campus with its Trans* Initiative.</p>\n<p>“In the last couple of years, transgender students have felt comfortable with this space … so that’s saying a lot – it’s a huge statement that they feel comfortable within the walls of this center,” said Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing resources and working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to make UCSB a more inclusive campus, the MCC hosts weekly meetings for “all trans folks and supportive allies,” according to its website.</p>\n<p>However, while the MCC is entering its 30th year of existence, this center is not the norm nationwide.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge statement, that UCSB has had a MultiCultural Center for 30 years. A lot of my colleagues from other campuses feel strongly that this MultiCultural Center is a very important, transformative space,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Other universities trying to follow in UCSB’s footsteps might face pushback from administration or minimal funding and staffing because multicultural centers are identity-based spaces, but Khan-Marcus advises them to continuously advocate for their students.</p>\n<p>“Social justice work is challenging, because it’s not easy work, but it’s absolutely needed at every campus. Even in this day and age, if you go and talk to some students of color, they will share with you that at times that they feel invisible at UCSB,” she said.</p>\n<p>For Lily Pham, Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) co-president, it is heartening to know that there’s someone out there who cares about centers like the MCC.</p>\n<p>“There’s some statistic that if you look it up, it’ll say we’re pretty up there in diversity. But that’s not always prevalent when you’re just walking around and seeing, at a face value, what the campus is,” Pham said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Sept. 20 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Wiggins has since been released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first report of a residential burglary came in around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) Sergeant Daniel Calderon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the police arrived at the location, the woman who reported the burglary also “located items stolen from her home inside of a Dodge Ram truck that was parked in front of her residence.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After approaching Wiggins, Scypino and Williams, who were near the truck, police arrested the three. Police then located more of the woman’s stolen property in the three suspects’ backpacks, along with additional property that had been stolen in a separate burglary earlier that morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victims of the early morning burglary “reported that they were at home asleep while that crime occured.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Sunday night, police tied together four burglaries that happened in I.V. over the course of the weekend, according to SBSO Sergeant Jarom Kemp. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When deputies started inventorying recovered property, they were able to link many of the burglaries together,” Kemp said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In some cases, entry into the dwelling was forced. In others, they gained entry by knowing ‘friends of friends.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the items stolen were electronics, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of the burglaries raised concern about the chaos of move-out weekend in I.V., as many students tend to leave their doors unlocked during the process and out-of-town visitors are not uncommon due to graduation ceremonies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students took to the Facebook group Free &amp; For Sale to warn people about the burglaries, while others discussed the hectic nature that comes with UCSB’s graduation since many students’ leases in I.V. end around that same weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One I.V. landlord who runs </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/from-dp-rentals-to-playa-life-i-v-40-isla-vista-properties-under-new-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playa Life I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Erin Eliza, posted on Facebook about move-out weekend, calling it a “toxic environment” and “Christmas for Criminals.” She also called for UCSB to have more authority over move-in weekend, referencing the university’s restrictions during Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted in the comments on her post that “1⁄2 the homes we own have had their bikes etc stolen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stolen property collected by police from the three suspects is being held at the I.V.

Simren Verma / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Steinhorn, a third-year communication major, and Adri Davies, a third-year political science major, have been close friends since their freshman year when they were matched as roommates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two got the idea to start a podcast about the lack of knowledge students have about A.S. during a class they took together last quarter: Writing for Public Discourse (105PD), an upper-division writing class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final project in the class was to put together an advocacy campaign, and Steinhorn and Davies decided to create a 30-minute podcast titled “Apathy Unveiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, this first episode of “Apathy Unveiled” is the only podcast the two have created but they plan to make more about A.S. and even expand to new topics, such as UCSB’s Greek system and national politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know a lot of the stuff that we ended up reporting on and covering until we started doing the research,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I think a lot of it also stemmed from our own curiosity about A.S. elections and how A.S. works.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the beginning of the podcast, Steinhorn spoke to how UCSB students seem to care about national politics, but not A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has one of the highest student voting populations out of public universities,” Steinhorn said. “But somehow, we have failed… to even get half the student body to vote in any recent [A.S.] elections.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn’s and Davies’ perspectives differ from that of current A.S. elected officials and candidates. Many students – including those currently running in the Spring Quarter 2019 elections – emphasize that the student body is unaware of A.S.’s budget due to a lack of transparency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies disagree. They find the root of the problem to be apathetic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Steinhorn and Davies began researching for the podcast, they decided to look into A.S.’s level of transparency for themselves and ended up finding A.S.’s budget almost immediately, Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue is not that we don’t have information or that it’s not transparent,” Davies said in the podcast. “You Google UCSB A.S. budget and it’s like the second link.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because students have no idea what’s going on, students that do run for positions know that they can get away with whatever they want basically.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies then went on in the podcast to discuss the disqualification of former External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA)-elect Mayela Morales and the subsequently vacant EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has tried to elect a new representative, and we have continually not been able to get enough student voters to allow that representative into their position,” Steinhorn said in the podcast, referring to the failed A.S. special elections held this past school year in an attempt to elect an EVPSA.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn re-emphasized that she believes the reason behind the vacant EVPSA position is largely due to apathetic students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies spent a bulk of the podcast, however, arguing that many students do not know the reality of how much money A.S. controls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy to attribute inaction to the lack of transparency, but then when we found that there was a lot of transparency… it’s like, okay then, what is the actual problem?” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “That kind of led us to talking to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies clarified that she believes it is hard to understand what happens inside of A.S. and what exactly is on A.S. elected officials’ agendas, noting that it is the budget and the financial information that she thinks is transparent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn and Davies asked UCSB students what they knew about A.S. and how much money they thought the A.S. budget was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student guessed $20,000, and another guessed $500,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of them missed the mark by a longshot. Steinhorn and Davies told each student they interviewed that A.S.’s budget for this school year was $13.8 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students responded with gasps, one exclaimed “Oh my god!” and one even said, “For what? What do they do?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies also asked the students if they knew how much each student individually pays A.S. with their fees and asked the students if they knew that the A.S. executive elected officials get most of their tuition paid through honoraria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with interviewing students not involved in A.S., they also interviewed an A.S. insider, who wanted to remain anonymous, and asked the insider to explain what exactly A.S. is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I’ve noticed on this campus is there is a small group of people who are politically engaged, and they end up determining a lot of student-wide issues… that not necessarily a majority of students would want,” the A.S. insider said during the podcast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the theme of apathy, Steinhorn and Davies stressed that they believe there is an issue of accessibility to A.S. Although they think that students can do more, they also believe that A.S. can do more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people probably view university government as more of a club than a body that actually makes decisions,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “It’s kind of like this selective group. It seems, at least from the outside, hard to break in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies then joined in on expressing her frustration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How are these people being picked? Who’s doing this? Is it like… you have to do this fellowship, and then you’re kind of bred in? It’s really strange. I’ve always just been… questioning it all,” Davies added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Steinhorn and Davies believe all students should feel obligated to make their voices heard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By saying that students are the issue, we’re also saying that students are the solution,” Davies said in the podcast, encouraging students to be informed voters.</span></p>\n<p>The podcast in full can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ApathyUnveiledFinal-2-%E2%80%93-Podcast.mov\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
