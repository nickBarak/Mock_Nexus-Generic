Gary Lawrence, director of the University Center (UCen), said he hopes to have the signs installed by July 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen Governance Board worked with Dwayne Mosbey, program coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), to learn more about the process of converting the bathrooms and the potential costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey was invited to speak at a UCen Governance Board meeting in May as a representative of the Trans Task Force, which has been advocating for more all-gender restrooms on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My purpose in going [to the meeting] was telling them what the steps have been with [the RCSGD] in the conversion of multi-stall restrooms, especially because there is no written policy within the UC code about how that is to be implemented, and we just recently finished the conversions for the Social Sciences and Media Studies building,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1732\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal Restroom Access Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, approved by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016, requires all single-stall restrooms in a “business establishment, place of public accommodation, or state or local government agency” in California to be marked as all-gender. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the bill does not address multi-stall restroom conversions, Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey, along with RCSGD Director Craig Leets and UCSB Policy Coordinator Jennifer Lofthus, has been working on an outline for a UCSB multi-stall bathroom conversion process to facilitate more conversions in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also addressed the board’s concerns about renovations to add more stalls, which he said weren’t necessary to have the restrooms converted. The total cost of converting the restrooms is about $300 to $350, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costs associated with single-stall restroom conversions are typically covered by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services, but Mosbey said the office did not want to cover the costs for multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board is still considering renovations to the restrooms, Mosbey cautioned against renovations, noting that they take much longer than signage changes and could create animosity toward people who identify as transgender or nonbinary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey is sitting on a special advisory committee over the summer to discuss what renovations would be necessary, if any. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD has been directing its efforts on bathroom conversion projects throughout this past year, with a focus on converting multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey’s first step was to update the </span><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AGRmap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-Gender Restroom Map</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which details the locations of all-gender restrooms on campus. He is also working with the Department of Geography to signify all-gender restrooms on the new interactive campus map the department is working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s next priorities are identifying all the single-stall restrooms on campus that still need to be converted and working with different departments on campus to convert multi-stall restrooms in their buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said that department heads and vice chancellor hold the power to approve these bathroom conversions. The multi-stall bathroom conversion in the Social Sciences and Media Studies building was the first multi-stall conversion the center helped facilitate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to get an all-gender restroom in every building on campus. But a realistic timeline of that, it could take up to years, depending on how many kinds of barriers we run into, whether departments actually end up agreeing to doing it,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

So for [transfer students] to even be in this position [to graduate], especially people of color, it’s so monumental. It really takes a lot for us to get here and to even graduate from a four-year institution,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think a lot of us expect [to graduate].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for Hernandez, and for the numerous transfer students graduating with the class of 2019, the Transfer Student Graduation is an “acknowledge[ment] that we did beat the statistics and that we are here. You achieved this. You deserve it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second year the Transfer Student Graduation has been held. Last year, the Transfer Student Graduation welcomed around 50 students; this year’s will see over 120, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Transfer Student Graduation Committee is mainly led by fourth-years Neyra Patricio, Katherin Jordan, Sophie Weimer and Hernandez; the committee began planning for graduation during Winter Quarter, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s budget to hold the entire graduation was $200. This year’s is $2,000, an improvement Hernandez attributes to the Transfer Student Alliance’s transformation from an organization to an Associated Students Boards, Commission and Units (BCU). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hernandez and Patricio, having a transfer student graduation is incredibly important in a number of ways, but particularly because of the unique and shared experiences that transfer students go through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because [the ceremony is] different. Most transfer students only have transfer friends, at least the people that I know, so getting to have a graduation ceremony with people that you know [is good], especially because a lot of transfers value it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all really nervous for it to get here, but we also want it to get here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, who was also involved in the planning of the Transfer Student Graduation during its first year, echoed Patricio’s sentiments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that being on Senate with the 69th Senate and working on the Transfer Student Alliance allowed him to see students “get rewarded for all the hard work they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing it last year, how it impacted and how it meant so much to many students… There’s literally people crying [at the ceremony] and it was very emotional and very intense, but it was good,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Hernandez and Patricio hope the tradition of a transfer student graduation ceremony continues after they both leave UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope we built the tradition and it keeps on going,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s ceremony will be held on June 14 in Bren Courtyard at 5 p.m. There will also be a reception at 6:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lavender Graduation and Pride Awards:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lavender Graduation — a graduation ceremony dedicated toward UCSB students who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community — has been running for 19 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony, alongside the Pride Awards, has served as an “integral part” of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), according to UCSB alumnus ‘18 and RCSGD Programming Coordinator Dwayne Mosbey, who helped plan this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Lavender Graduation] began to create a space for queer and trans students, especially when they were entering spaces they didn’t necessarily feel comfortable in or within an insitution they didn’t feel was serving them,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The planning of this year’s ceremony was a “collaborative effort” between Mosbey, RCSGD Director Craig Leets and Associative Director Quinn Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey explained that in previous years, the Pride Awards used to be separate; this year, they were “rolled together” because both are “made to recognize queer and trans students’ resilience and academic achievement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thought it’d be great for those two to be coupled together,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduation ceremony itself is modeled similarly to the typical UCSB graduation, Mosbey said. The ceremony will see graduates “walk” into the Student Resource Building forum, following a welcome ceremony with a number of speakers, which typically includes the vice chancellor, a keynote speaker and a student speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said there are typically 30 to 35 people who partake in the ceremony; this year saw an uptick, rounding out to 45 students. Last year, Mosbey himself was one of the people who walked in the Lavender Graduation ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows the chance for queer and trans students to be recognized outside of the larger ceremony, and [anyone] can come to the Lavender Graduation. [They can express] their most gender expression and gender identity and feel comfortable with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can wear whatever they want and can also decorate their gowns and caps — “This is all about making sure [queer and trans students] feel comfortable and that they feel recognized.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All graduates who go through the Lavender Graduation ceremony are awarded purple cords, while folks who work at the RCSGD and people who win awards receive rainbow tassels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of awards also varies, depending on the number of nominations. This year, 13 awards will be handed out, according to Mosbey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey hopes students who go through the ceremony will take away one key thing: “We’re allowing that space for them to feel supported, [so they] know that throughout their college career, the queer and trans community was here for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that we will continue to be here for them even after they graduate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Lavender Graduation will happen on June 9 between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. in the Student Resource Building forum. </span></p>\n<p><b>Black Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Bolden, a fourth-year biopsychology major and the undergraduate speaker for this year’s Black Graduation, said he almost turned down the opportunity to speak at this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was kind of hesitant, just because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do have pretty good experience with public speaking, but I didn’t feel like I wanted to add that [burden] on for myself,” he said. “But then [the offer] gave me a little bit of moment of clarity, because I got a chance to look back and see how far I’ve really come.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of realized that it was a little bit humbling,” Bolden added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden is one of the 55 Black undergraduate and graduate students who will be participating in this year’s Black Graduation ceremony on Saturday, June 15 at noon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Stallworth, co-chair of the organizing committee and second-year sociology and Black studies double major, said it’s important for Black students to have a space where they can come together and celebrate their achievements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The educational system wasn’t really built for people of color in general, but for Black students, we really had to fight for us to have our identity be present on campus,” Stallworth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony is a way for Black students to do just that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth said the ceremony will have a mix of student speakers as well as spoken word, musical performances and slideshows of the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Jeffrey Stewart, from UCSB’s Department of Black Studies, and Professor R. L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy from New York University’s Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science and Humanities, are the two faculty speakers. Meridith Merchant, a psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services, is the closing speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth believes the speakers’ words will leave an impression on the graduating students and is looking forward to hearing from them all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The speech is] sending a message and it’s setting the tone for someone’s life,” he said. “I think it’s just really important to have speakers that really motivate and empower students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth is also happy to see the graduates — many of whom have helped him in his two years at UCSB — step off the stage and onto a new chapter after college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I’m] also just excited to see all the Black grads and be able to celebrate them because I think it’s amazing how they’ve been really mentors for me throughout my time here at UCSB. I get to see them go off, and I get to follow in their footsteps.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden echoed Stallworth’s words, naming several other students who will be graduating alongside him  as inspirations over the past few years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to talking about the achievements of the Black community at UCSB over the past few years, Bolden said he wants to highlight the growth of individual students like Zenzile Riddick and Kuvimbanashe “Eddie” Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class of Black grads is phenomenal. One of my hallmates, she’s going to freakin’ Harvard, that’s amazing, Zenzile. Since first year, I knew she was going to be amazing,” Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said he’s proud to have seen everyone’s growth over the past four years and where they’re all headed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m proud to be part of the 5% that has come through here. I definitely recognize that a lot of people don’t have such a positive outlook of UCSB like I have, not everyone’s been blessed with the great experience that I’ve had here,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[But] after coming here, I think that my pride in being a Black man has done nothing but grown exponentially, because I feel like I’m representing my own people here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A special part of the ceremony for Bolden is the fact that a large portion of the Black graduates participating in the ceremony lived together in the Black Scholars Hall in Santa Rosa during their first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be around each other and enjoy each other’s presence and see each other’s faces and see us finish through,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At typical graduation ceremonies, it’s easy for Black students to feel like less of a community, Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing us spread so thin isn’t the same, isn’t nearly as powerful for us being together, having our own space, our own ceremony, our own opportunity to recognize one another.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said his speech at the Black Graduation ceremony will be one of the first times his family will see him in an academic setting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now this is an opportunity for me to show [my mom] what I’ve been doing this whole time.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Chicanx/Latinx Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chicanx/Latinx Graduation ceremony is just as much about the community behind students as it is about the graduating students themselves, two of the organizers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesenia Cardenas, a fifth-year chemistry major, and Jessica Arenas, a fourth-year global studies major, agreed their favorite part of the ceremony is when the students walk into Harder Stadium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are asked to bring two people to walk them in as live mariachi music plays in the background and photographers snap photos of them, the two said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students, they feel like they get their degree for family too, so it’s nice that you can walk up there, it’s almost like they’re walking up there with you,” Cardenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas sit on an 11-member organizing committee that begins its work one full year before graduation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s cabinet, which organized the 45th Chicanx/Latinx Graduation being held on Saturday, June 15, 2019 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., was dedicated to giving more voice to graduating students throughout the whole process, Cardenas and Arenas both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year we’ve been focusing a lot on being inclusive of Central American identities because that’s a prominent issue, the erasure of Central Americans,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, Arenas said it can be hard to actually feel that they are supported or represented on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a first-generation student, it’s hard to navigate higher education, and sometimes you don’t see people that look like you, in your classroom settings or even in your living settings sometimes,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like most students enjoy the Chicanx/Latinx Graduation because it celebrates their identity and also their cultural background. They aren’t represented in classrooms, but they do feel represented in the graduation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to infusing the ceremony with various cultural elements, the committee works to ensure that the ceremony caters to family members who attend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ceremony, held in Harder Stadium, will have over 500 students walking the stage. A lot of those students are first-generation and have parents who don’t speak English, Cardenas said, so they will have a translator present so their parents can follow along as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my personal experience, my parents don’t really know what I do here, they just know that I go to school and I’m studying,” Arenas laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas said that while friends and family back home might not understand what they’re studying, they’re still very proud of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d rather them understand the ceremony than just sitting there and see all these names called out. At least with [Chicanx/Latinx Graduation] there’s performances and Spanish,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><b>Undocumented Student Services:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monarch butterfly, adorning a pin which many undocumented graduating students will be wearing as they walk the stage, is a symbol of migration, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator Diana Valdivia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To wear this pin is to recognize the impact migration has had in your life experiences. This pin is a small token of your resiliency and accomplishments,” a small note accompanying the pin reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undocumented Student Services began to distribute the pins to graduating undocumented students last year, Valdivia said. The pins are meant to recognize both undocumented students and others who participate in the services’ programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its year-end ceremony, the service recognizes different student leaders for their work and advocacy in the undocumented student community on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Valdivia said they had approximately 30 students graduating, compared to around 25 last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s good to know for [undocumented students] that they’re graduating, that they’re not the only one that is graduating that has been through this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the service also handed out separate pins for students to give to their loved ones and supporters, one of which reads “Proud Immigrant Dad of a Graduating Senior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We recognize that students get pins, get stoles and then we also know that it took a community effort to have folks graduate,” Valdivia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Valdivia said they hope to find a way to recognize students who may not be undocumented themselves but have family members or loved ones who are. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The Coalition, and Chikukwa, have been fighting for the funding for nearly two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding is separate from the Cal Grant, although it is based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the funding allocation is a win for the CBUC, it does come with an asterisk; if there is not sufficient projected revenue in the California General Fund during the 2021-22 fiscal year and the 2022-23 fiscal year, the combined $10 million in funding will be suspended on Dec. 31, 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a suspension happens, the California Legislature intends to “consider alternative solutions to restore this program,” Senate Bill 106, the bill written to implement this portion of the budget, reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UC Santa Barbara said in a </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ucsbfinaid/status/1144756479125159937\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is waiting on more information from the state and the UC Office of the President (UCOP) before releasing an official statement on when the money will be distributed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email, Saúl Quiroz, director of UCSB’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, said that students will receive the standard message they get any time there is a change to their financial aid. However, he said the office will also likely be reaching out to the specific students who will receive this additional funding; students who qualify can use the additional aid beginning this Summer Session A. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If they have a balance, it will first be applied toward that balance. If the funding is enough to cover their balance, or if the student does not have a balance, students will receive the remaining credit in the form of a financial aid refund,” he also clarified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will be disbursed in the same way other financial awards are distributed — through a student’s BARC account — Quiroz added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office is still waiting on “official guidance from the UC Office of the President regarding awarding practices on individual campuses” and more information about how much of the $4 million will be allocated for UCSB, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The allocations for this summer will be tied to historical Cal Grant allocations, and we hope to learn what UCSB’s share will be soon,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quiroz also expressed excitement about the funding and gratitude toward CBUC for the organization’s work over the past two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without their extraordinary effort, this additional funding would have not been made available to our students,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that this funding is the first step toward ensuring that Summer Cal Grants will become a reality in the next year or two.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The additional summer financial aid allocation is not the same as the Summer Cal Grant Bill, Amy Rose, policy analyst at the California Budget and Policy Center — a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Sacramento — emphasized. Rose focuses on studying higher education issues and has “closely followed and researched” various financial aid proposals, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose was the one to clarify to the CBUC that the funding was not technically a Summer Cal Grant Bill, but instead provides summer financial aid to the UC and CSU and is given to students based on Cal Grant eligibility.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cal Grants are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC), whereas the budget’s “summer financial aid” funding flows directly to the UC and CSU,” she said in an email. “In addition, Cal Grants are available to students at California Community Colleges and the private institutions, whereas the budget’s funding is restricted to students at UC and CSU.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, students could use their Cal Grant aid during the summer, although there is a cap on a student’s lifetime eligibility that may leave them ineligible for that aid in the future, Rose said. The new summer aid means students won’t have to draw from their Cal Grant to cover the costs of summer classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget allocation differs in that it provides money directly to the UC and CSU to distribute but is still based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa explained. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language of SB 106 is left vague, giving most of the discretion to the CSU and UC campuses on how to distribute it, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose said that one reason for the vague language was to give the universities the ability to work with their own institutional aid programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s possible that the ambiguity was to allow room for both institutions to distribute aid through their existing programs (which have their own goals, criteria, etc.),” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose also added that previous versions of the bill allocated funding solely for tuition and fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[T]he new spending plan does not use that language so it is unclear if this summer aid will be used for tuition and fees or for living costs such as housing and food, which many low-income students struggle to afford,” Rose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, who has been working toward securing additional summer financial aid for students since Fall Quarter 2017, said that while there was a lot of excitement after CBUC’s</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CoalitionForABetterUC/posts/1476519299140032?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCv8FnYqJItuzzrHm4xgmt5zBz-bEYkdecwdLS8i1QIqCFJ7BeYnclayQs2J6G48l24KvLi-l9AIC5snV-miZjhQsSqiHS9zhp7zY4IGKQ4Wc5CSBntDJvFTHeIkL94WEflllosVMWyIrja1Us5iurUyrephO22Wp-EA1qg1cYsBJdkIXOhRqE3_tOZskfiS0ZcHk23IsD0s_Zy1XoBCrCIY-nWu88RqeXiPM2dscxYXfAWs8DG6v4A053h9o2n2x0LlME2bWnvdPvpwjXqZOiw7gnRrA_XsiJnKo0gQhyHtpZUt0Z3gjjf8XK1c9okEdL7XBOuuEk9ImOA2ANll-9ofg&amp;__tn__=H-R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this morning, there were still a lot of questions, too, which is what he and other members of the coalition are now working to clarify. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CBUC has focused its efforts on the Summer Cal Grant Bill for the past two years but has been working on various other projects behind the scenes as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the Coalition is there is no specific thing you can say, ‘This is all we do.’ We do a bunch of different things … it was always, ‘We need to be flexible to do whatever we think is the most necessary thing,’” Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he is now the “retired chair,” as he jokingly referred to himself as, Chikukwa has high hopes for the Coalition’s future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know [future Coalition members] are gonna be better than us,” he said. “And when I say better than us, I mean in the sense that they’re gonna do whatever they do, in a manner that’s better than the way we approached our problems, because they got to see a lot of our failures. They got to see a lot of our successes, also.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa noted that most of the members of CBUC are underclassmen or are entering their junior years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daevionne Beasley, incoming director of internal affairs for CBUC and Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs, said the work the Coalition did would not have been possible without the support of individual students and various student groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done,” he said in a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa also attributed CBUC’s success to “all the students who either signed a petition, called, lobbied, retweeted, shared” or engaged with their social media in any way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That, I believe, was the tipping point. It was a grassroots movement, and there was a lot of people, so many people at the table who made this happen outside the Coalition for a Better UC.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: [6/29]: A previous version of this article said that SB461 did not make it past the Committee on Higher Education; the story is updated to clarify that the bill was paused once the budget ask looked like the better avenue to pursue.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Sir said she has spoken to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez about the app and plans to work on its implementation throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really want to focus on bringing A.S. out of the dark ages and making sure that entities, all the resources, are [available] in one app,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also plans to secure a permanent location for the A.S. Bike Shop, a project which former President Brooke Kopel began in the 2018-19 school year. At the end of her term, Kopel presented several possible permanent locations to the 69th Senate. Sir has met with Kopel regarding the bike shop and plans to implement Kopel’s vision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beside her other projects, Sir’s primary focus for the year is what she calls Strategic Vision 2025, a five-year outline of specific goals for UCSB that would improve future A.S. administrations Her plan expands upon one </span><a href=\"https://plan.as.ucsb.edu/files/2014/11/StrategicPlanMay2014.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created by former A.S.

I’m not looking really for people who have experience in A.S., because I didn’t even have any coming in,” he said. “One of my interview questions is, ‘What is your perception of A.S., and how would you like to alter that?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley’s priorities going forward are ensuring that summer conferences are organized in a timely manner, which especially helps with saving costs, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the conferences are over, he plans to start laying the groundwork for his office’s work in the fall so they can hit the ground running. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing I’m really, really wanting to focus on is supporting incarcerated people now and people who were formerly incarcerated, so I’ll be working really hard with my federal policy analyst and statewide policy analyst to see just what is the UC’s role in private prisons,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley wants to ensure that his office has its timeline sketched out early on in the year so it can get as much done as possible, noting that a yearlong term isn’t very long at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his outreach both to students and student organizations already on campus, as well as to incoming first years, Beasley plans to prioritize in-person presentations.

past year and that needs to absolutely change on both sides,” Adam told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The eye rolling, the laughing … the disrespectfulness and the feelings that are created to where certain senators feel like they’re not meant for this role … that’s not how I want any of my senators to feel.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam, now a fourth-year political science major, plans to hit the ground running when Fall Quarter 2019 begins by filling the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/senate-votes-to-open-applications-for-ccs-on-campus-senatorial-vacancies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two empty</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senate seats, holding training sessions for senators  and facilitating better engagement between senators and the campus at large. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 70th Senate held its first meeting on May 22 with only 23 senators instead of 25, as an on-campus senatorial seat and College of Creative Studies senatorial seat remained unfilled after Spring Quarter elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the beginning of her term, Adam was also responsible for the appointment of Off-Campus Senator Tianna White as first Pro-Tempore and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman as second Pro-Tempore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the immediate goal of fulfilling the empty Senate positions, Adam said her focus will be on training senators in the beginning of the fall quarter as opposed to winter quarter, which is when Adam herself was trained when she was a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators [from the 69th Senate] weren’t provided with any sort of training, whether it was on the association, microaggressions — literally any training until the middle of winter quarter… our first half of [the 69th] Senate was just whether or not you had an in with Steven [Ho, former IVP], and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” Adam said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t come in magically knowing anything once you’re elected. So [I want to hold] trainings early and often so that all of the senators are on a level playing field and are able to [perform to] the best of their abilities… [and] have the best resources and knowledge to create change and do the projects they want to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another goal of Adam’s over the course of her term is for senators to change the way they interact with their respective Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As IVP, Adam “serve[s] as the official overseer and reference for all interactions between the Senate Liaisons and their BCU’s,” and must “train the Senators in how to be liaisons,” according to A.S. Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam told senate liaisons during their May 29 meeting that they should strive to “individualize” their approach to BCUs by working “smarter, not harder” to address the needs of each organization individually.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
