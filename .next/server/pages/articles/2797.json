For this reason, the committee motioned to pass $0 for seven of the eight requests made by student organizations.</p>\n<p>The UCSB League of Legends club requested funding for food for an upcoming event and the Women’s Club Water Polo captain, third-year Heather Borek-Klempfner, asked the committee to provide funds to help the team travel to Vermont, California for the Pacific Coast Division Championships.</p>\n<p>Money was also requested for the Black Pioneers’ Renaissance Organization’s annual Black <em>Women’s Appreciation</em> community outreach program on May 14 and to fund a Films for Funds project to show movies for $1 on Sundays at Isla Vista Theater to raise money for non-profits.</p>\n<p>Because of the lack of funding for Office of Student Life line item, the committee was unable to approve funding for any of these six student requests.</p>\n<p>Hermanos Unidos member Juan Carlos Gomez requested to reallocate funds granted previously by the committee to reserve the Hub for a dance during the fraternity’s College Link Outreach Program to reserve the Music Bowl, instead. The event usually attracts 120 high school students from the Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>\n<p>“We were awarded $350 to reserve the Hub because we throw a dance for them on the second night of the program,” Gomez said. “Unfortunately we were unable to reserve the Hub.”</p>\n<p>A.S. University Affairs also requested approval for the reallocation of $10 from honoraria funding into special projects. The committee approved both requests.</p>\n<p>Tri Delta Philanthropy Chair Cyrena Gonzalez requested funds for the sorority’s iHop charity “all you can eat” pancake event to take place on May 8 from 6 to 9 p.m to benefit St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.</p>\n<p>“We have been partners with them since 1989 and we have raised about $40 million for them as a national sorority,” Gonzales said. “This will be our sorority’s first year doing it and I can tell it’s going to be very successful.”</p>\n<p>Kappa Alpha Theta Philanthropy Chair Carly Stewart requested funding for the sorority’s annual kickball tournament on May 16 to raise money for the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program, a national organization that trains individuals to represent children in court who don’t have access to lawyers.</p>\n<p>The committee also passed the motion to fund $2,598 of the requested $5,195.50 by the Vietnamese Students Association to fund its culture week beginning May 11, which includes an educational workshop, Vietnamese food tastings and a fashion show.</p>\n<p>Fraternity Delta Sigma Pi also received funding for a $250 start-up and the Community Financial Fund was granted $320 in senate allocated funds for honoraria.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-21/a-s-finance-considers-student-funding-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-21/a-s-finance-considers-student-funding-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-21/a-s-finance-considers-student-funding-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-21/a-s-finance-considers-student-funding-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-21/a-s-finance-considers-student-funding-requests/","id":2797,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2796,2795,2794],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro","biography":"Not available","articles":[2382,2386,2475,2567,2730,2735,2797,2823,2909,2948,2981,2990,3586,3605,3870,3895,3915,4407,4654,4682,4799],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: I.V.

For the past hour I had been chasing little shorebreak swells near the beach access while a group of drunken fools howled obscene stuff through a megaphone at us. Those fucking I.V. bros.</p>\n<p>I.V. bros are a special breed. They’ve got all the tendencies of normal brociety, but they’re even more ignorant, callous and stupid than the rest.</p>\n<p>It’s not just their strict regimen of playing Snappa by 9 a.m. and brofighting by 3 a.m., or their innate ability to break other peoples’ valuables and smash anything made out of glass in the most inconvenient of places. What makes me hate DP bros so much is that they can’t stop themselves from throwing large, often usable pieces of furniture and other household goods off of balconies.</p>\n<p>The “thudsplitcrack! ‘Yaaaa Bro!’” coming from shore almost made me lose my shit. A big wooden dresser tumbled down from the 6600 block of DP and onto the beach. Sharks, dolphins and crabs do not eat abandoned waste, you filthy polluters. Someone with a heart and a sense of respect for the environment actually picks all of that shit up and disposes of it properly.</p>\n<p>I hate those miserable polluting bastards.</p>\n<p>It had started as a quick, in between class sesh. The sun wasn’t shining, but to me the weather was sweet — like home in Northern California. Brisk and foggy. I was grateful that at least a few levelheaded people had chosen not to take a speedy, techno-infused trip down Taaka road to blackout alley at midday.</p>\n<p>A lull, and then a wave came.</p>\n<p>“To the rescue, here I am.”</p>\n<p>Being in the water listening to Bob triggered a memory of Bull Bay — an area 10 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica. I stayed there once for a day and a night as I passed through the country. Bull Bay is without a doubt a rough place, and thinking of my time there quickly had me brooding on the stark contrasts between here and Jamaica: standards of living, American wastefulness, what we consider a tough day.</p>\n<p>“Want you to know just if you can/Where I stand, know, know, know, where I stand”</p>\n<p>We throw away clothing, food and materials at an unhealthy, disgustingly vain rate. If it’s at Costco, it will always be available, we assume.</p>\n<p>The world is sick. The privileged members of brociety living all around me don’t know how lucky they are.</p>\n<p>“So to the rescue, to the rescue, to the rescue/ Awake from your sleep and slumber/ Today could be your lucky number/ Sun is shining and the weather is sweet.”</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus<em> surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld might be upset when he finds out that one of the sports eds threw a shitty desk off his balcony last weekend just to see what would happen.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27702\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27702\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/nuglets-wisdom-iv-bros/","id":2794,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2793,2792,2791],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

During the forum, attendees discussed ways to help students overcome dining obstacles and more easily obtain groceries.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze, one of the main goals of the Food Bank is not just to feed the struggling students, but to focus on providing healthy, nutritious food, and finding solutions to problems such as grocery store accessibility.</p>\n<p>“The Food Bank exists as a service because students are struggling to make ends meet. The purpose of this forum is to help students become self-sufficient and be able to feed themselves,” Freeze said. “The Food Bank is a holistic service. We’re trying to make sure students have healthy food and know where it comes from.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people aren’t aware of student hunger; it’s always kept on the down low. – Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze</p></blockquote>\n<p>Freeze said many students on campus suffer from hunger and the forum hopes to educate students on how to combat it and allow attendees to share their thoughts in establishing short and long-term goals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people aren’t aware of student hunger; it’s always kept on the down low,” Freeze said. “The Forum empowers students who are personally facing hunger or encourages those who want to make a difference … Our long term goals are improving access to farmers markets and transportation to grocery stores.”</p>\n<p>According to sustainability coordinator of UCSB’s Department of Geography Katie Maynard, UCSB Sustainability wants to unite all the different groups and departments on campus to discuss food programs that occur on campus. Maynard said the goal is for all sustainability, environment and food groups to serve as a coalition rather than individual organizations.</p>\n<p>“[We are] a sustainability coalition rather than individual organizations,” Maynard said. “UCSB Sustainability is trying to create a web that happens throughout the different programs that happen on campus. [We want to] develop collective goals across the different departments and with the feedback, incorporate into the new sustainability plan.”</p>\n<p>Vice Chair of the A.S. Food Bank Committee Erick Lankey said the food bank is just one of many resources for students on campus. Lankey said instead of working to expand the organization, the food bank wants to combine with other departments to provide a wider variety of services to students in need.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to be the highlight, there are other resources that are needed in our space, not just pure distribution of food,” Lankey said. “The idea of a food bank is a good idea, but in an ideal world, we don’t want to exist. We want to have this but also combine with other departments [to focus] for total well-being. We want to become deeper rather than expand bigger.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>They should have a broader range of choices. Students are used to eating crappy food, but what they have chance to grow and prep their food, their diets change. Just asking what people want is not a valid measure of the potential. – Environmental Studies Professor David Cleveland</p></blockquote>\n<p>During the forum, attendees broke off into groups to discuss various short and long-term goals for the campus. Environmental Studies Professor David Cleveland said the UCen should focus more on providing healthy options rather than profit.</p>\n<p>“UCen dining is restricting what they can sell [and] got rid of some healthy alternative on campus because they are competing with the dining services,” Cleveland said. “The University isn’t providing them the support first generation college students need. Resources aren’t following student demographics and there is a shortage of support for those students, which relates to their inability to get healthy food.”</p>\n<p>Cleveland said asking students about their food preferences does not always lead to healthier dining support plans.</p>\n<p>“They should have a broader range of choices. Students are used to eating crappy food, but what they have chance to grow and prep their food, their diets change,” Cleveland said. “Just asking what people want is not a valid measure of the potential.”</p>\n<p>According to Cleveland, “pressure can change policy,” meaning the only way to incite change is by fighting for it as he did years ago when the University wanted to eliminate the campus gardens in favor of new housing for graduate students.</p>\n<p>“In 2000, [the school] wanted to eliminate [the campus] gardens and there was no alternative,” Cleveland said. “They would do all sorts of stuff to manipulate us so that we don’t oppose it, but all of a sudden, at the planning meeting, the Vice Chancellor of Facilities said they would put the graduate housing somewhere else instead.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62559\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62559\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/","id":2795,"author":{"id":162,"name":"Kelly Lin"},"related":[2794,2793,2792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Talk To Discuss Sexual Assault","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-DW-Web-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-DW-Web-2.jpg?resize=508%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblyman Das Williams will give a talk titled “Sexual Assault on College Campuses” in Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall today at 8 p.m.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Santa Barbara Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblyman Das Williams will give a talk titled “Sexual Assault on College Campuses” in Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall today at 8 p.m.</p>\n<p>The talk, hosted by Walter H. Capps Center’s forum on Ethics and Public Policy, will focus on how legislation can address sexual assault and how institutions of higher learning use disciplinary codes to penalize perpetrators of sexual assault without holding them criminally liable. Jackson and Williams have both introduced legislation this year focusing on college administrations’ mechanisms for enforcing sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>Williams recently introduced several bills to the state assembly to combat sexual assault, including AB 967, which would extend perpetrator sentences to at least two years of suspension up to expulsion; AB 968, which would require academic transcripts to indicate if a student is ineligible to re-enroll; and AB 969, which would allow community colleges to suspend or expel perpetrators as well as require them to disclose information regarding their history of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, California universities are not doing enough to address sexual assault on campus.</p>\n<p>“More needs to be done to provide a safe and secure environment for our students at our higher education institutions,” Williams said in an email. “We must ensure that our campuses are investigating crimes, prosecuting perpetrators, and providing support and resources to victims.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is a very low conviction rate for sexual assault cases because they require evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>“This [amount of hard evidence] is very difficult to achieve given the nature of the crime,” Williams said in an email. “There needs to be some consequences for committing sexual assault and my bills are attempting to make that easier to achieve.”</p>\n<p>Jackson recently introduced a bill titled SB-695, which would require high school health courses to include instruction on affirmative consent, sexual harassment, assault, violence and healthy relationships. According to Jackson, proactive sexual assault prevention starts with early education about healthy relationships and consent for both male and female students.</p>\n<p>“If we want to prevent sexual assault, it’s important that we start early,” Jackson stated in a press release. “This bill will ensure that discussions about healthy relationships and consent are taking place in high school.”</p>\n<p>Hannah Bartlebaugh, undergraduate assistant at the Capps Center and fourth-year political science and psychology double major, said she helped with media outreach for the event and hopes it will shed light on the public policy conversation in progress at a statewide level about sexual assault on campus.</p>\n<p>“I hope it brings greater light, not only to the issue … but also to what policy work is being done to address it,” Bartlebaugh said.</p>\n<p>Williams said he is speaking at Lotte Lehmann in order to help spark discussion about sexual assault on add campus and get students to advocate for policies that will combat and end sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“I hope we’ll have a productive conversation about how to change campus policies to make it easier for survivors of sexual assault to get justice and not have to continue going to school with their assailants,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>Gregory Jarrett from Walter H. Capps for the Study of Ethics, Religion, and Public Life and coordinator of the Sexual Assault on College Campuses event said that sexual violence on college campuses is not a new issue, but the public is paying attention to the issue now largely because of new acknowledgements made by political entities regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Campus Sexual violence is a very old problem, but only occasionally is it discussed outside of a few classrooms. It is currently back in the public eye, in part because the Department of Education and the Obama Administration have recognized the argument that this is not just a problem of isolated individuals,” Jarrett stated in an email. “It is also an assault on women, depriving women of an equal right to education under Title IX.”</p>\n<p>Jarrett also said college campuses have been unsuccessful in changing the situation of sexual violence on campus and the community has the opportunity to come together during this event with Williams and Jackson to create productive discourse surrounding the subject.<br>\n“The level of sexual violence against women on campus is a moral outrage. Universities appear to be unable to change the situation without outside support,” Jarrett said in an email. “This is an opportunity for all of us to come together in the spirit of community and openly discuss these issues, and hopefully come to a consensus to actually do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/talk-to-discuss-sexual-assault/","id":2796,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[2795,2794,2793],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
