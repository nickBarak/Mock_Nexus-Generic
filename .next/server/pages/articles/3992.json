CSD business.</p>\n<p>“Obviously this is not a living wage, this is not a big salary or anything. This this is just a basic payment,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“Public service is absolutely important and we’re privileged to do the work that we do, but we want to make sure that people who want to get involved in their community and serve in this capacity can have at least a little more assistance and financial security.”</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with four yes votes and one abstention by Director Thurlow.</p>\n<p>Directors also have the option to waive their payments or accept the money and immediately return it to the board, an option Thurlow said he would be following.</p>\n<p>There is approximately $16,800 in allocations for the year to compensate directors for their time, according to the I.V. CSD’s 2018-19 budget.</p>\n<p>The board has been discussing this for about two months, following an acquisition of the I.V. CSD’s funding through Measure R, Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD’s policy committee is creating a policy for what can be reimbursed. The committee will discuss this during its Policy Committee Regular meeting on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>“This is something that will make service in the board of directors more inclusive,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“We recognize that we have very limited finances, and we want to be respectful of that while also making sure there’s a basic level of pay to just assist with the incredible amount of work that goes into this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
