As for pitching, the UCSB pitching staff has a total 4.76 ERA compared to a 4.89 ERA for that of CSUN.</p>\n<p>These team statistics are of little dominance in the Big West Conference overall, and they are not of great contrast in comparison to one another. However, they highlight that the Gauchos have marginally been pitching, producing fewer errors and creating hits a bit more successfully as a team than the Matadors have and that they generally have not been struggling as much as Northridge has.</p>\n<p>Despite the teams’ struggles, CSUN junior catcher and designated hitter Albee Weiss is leading the Big West in RBIs this season with 25 and teammate Kevin Riley is right behind him with 24.</p>\n<p>Riley, a redshirt junior first-baseman, is also tied for first in Big West in HRs with six total, just above Weiss, who is sitting at a tied second place with five HRs on the year so far. The two sluggers are placed at spots three and four, respectively, on the Matadors’ starting lineup and present a clear threat to the UCSB pitching staff and defense.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, junior outfielder Colton Burns is on the season leaderboard of hitting statistics, with a batting average of .362 to earn him the third spot in the Big West. But other than Burns, no other Gauchos are individually leading the conference at the plate. In fact, no other Gaucho hitter that has started every game is currently hitting above the .300 mark.</p>\n<p>As teams, neither UCSB nor CSUN evidently has a command over the other, making this series a fairly even matchup. However, they each have strong and talented individuals who assuredly have the potential to execute on any opportunities that come their way to produce a spark for success. Moreover, baseball is a game that has the tendency to defy any sort of expected outcomes one might provide, as most fans know.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, in particular, it definitely needs a change of pace if it wants to salvage what has been a rough start to the season.

The shop, located at 6549 Pardall Rd., debuted on Tuesday and is both the newest and only barbershop in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before making the decision to open a second shop in I.V., Ramirez took a grassroots style approach to best figure out the location of his second shop, asking students in the community about their thoughts on having a barbershop in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I came out here, there was no barbershop, so I was like, ‘Geesh, where are these kids going [for a haircut]?’ So I started talking to kids, asking them where they get their haircut … [I found out that] a lot of them wait to go back home to get their haircut because there’s nowhere to go, and they don’t trust anybody,” Ramirez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the lack of barber shops may have posed an inconvenience to residents in the past, Ramirez believes his new shop in I.V. will remedy these problems by offering a prime location in I.V. as well as a unique customer experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For $25, many shops offer quality haircuts, but not many offer a quality experience, which Ramirez finds to be a defining characteristic in successful barbershops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accompany the debut of his new shop, Ramirez opted to include a pool table, multiple flat-screen TVs, back massagers and refreshments for patrons — all of which he is confident will contribute to the “experience” of coming to his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Getting a haircut, you shouldn’t have to be like, ‘Oh, I have to get a haircut,’ you should be stoked to get a haircut. You get to come, hangout, get here an hour early, watch the game,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s more than a barbershop. It’s an experience, and that’s what we’re providing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other ideas, Ramirez plans to make use of the large white walls surrounding the inside of the shop, flirting with the idea of featuring student-generated art. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the amenities, Ramirez’s idea of the barbershop “experience” did not occur to him overnight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before he began working as a barber, Ramirez used to frequent barbershops as often as once a week, where he was attracted to its overall atmosphere and ambiance.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86655\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86655\" data-attachment-id=\"86655\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/barbershop-debut-sparks-new-buzz-in-i-v/barber-shop-iv_ida-kazerani_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1428&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1428\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Barber Shop IV_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86655 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Barber-Shop-IV_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ramirez wants his barbershop to be a place where people come to have a good time. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was the type of guy, back then, who’d get a haircut once a week because I liked going to the barbershop. I liked hanging out, I liked talking with the boys and watching the games,”  he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With multiple shops of his own, Ramirez aims to replicate the same qualities that initially attracted him to become a regular at barbershops he frequented before he began cutting hair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cutting hair in high school, Ramirez was formally introduced to the barbershop world when he was 20, after his best friend convinced him to get his barber license and work at his barbershop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I started at a shop in Pismo Beach, came out to Santa Barbara, cut hair at a shop called Montecito Barbers, was there for five years, broke off and built my own shop. And now we’re here, number two,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently dividing his time between both locations, Ramirez used to spend all of his time at the Montecito location after opening it in 2010. Things were going smoothly for Ramirez until the massive flood ravaged through Montecito last January, making it impossible for him and his barbers to work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than waiting it out, Ramirez devised a plan to work around the flooding by setting up a pop-up shop in the back room of a wine store.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were out of work and the village was shut down, so we did a pop-up shop over at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie Slone Wines. We had this little space in the back where we put up four chairs, people came in and got their haircut … it was just a cool thing for the community to come together and help everybody out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For businesses such as Ramirez’s, mudslides can have a devastating impact on revenue, keeping customers away and making barbers unable to reach the shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the pop-up shop helped Ramirez appreciate the power of community, something he hopes to carry with him to his new location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you put a barber shop in, you become a hub of the town … We like to integrate ourselves into the community, we like to do things, have events, after-hour events,” Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re gonna do as much for the students as possible — this shop is for the students.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

To lead off the game, short-stop and Preseason All-American Clay Fisher would hit a bomb over the left field fence in the Gauchos’ first at bat of the season. In one swing of the bat, Fisher would be the first person in Division I Baseball in 2017 to get a hit, hit a home run, drive in a run, and collect an RBI.</p>\n<p>Later in the top of the fourth, still ahead 1-0 from Fisher’s lead off homerun, Colton Burns would crush a ball over the right field fence, extending the Gauchos lead 2-0. Burns, a junior college transfer from College of Canyons, is coming off a monster sophomore year where he hit .406 with 30 RBI’s and 4 homeruns.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, starting pitcher Noah Davis was busy silencing non-believers who thought UCSB would not have enough pitching depth or a true ace after the departure of Shane Bieber. Davis would absolutely shove, giving up only one run and striking out four in six innings pitched.</p>\n<p>From here, the Fish Show would continue. Fisher would go 2-for-4 finishing with one run and three RBIs for the Gauchos. After some well executed sac flies from J.J. Muno (0-3, 1 RBI) and Thomas Rowan (1-2, 1 RBI), Alex Garcia would come in and get his first save of the season (1 hit, 2 strikeouts). The Gauchos and Davis would get their first W of the season with a final score of 6-3 over the Lions.</p>\n<p>The second game, played on Saturday, featured a pitcher’s duel between UCSB’s Kyle Nelson/Steven Ledesma and LMU’s Brenton Arriaga.  The lefty Kyle Nelson was also selected for Preseason All-American honors, coming off a stellar sophomore year having a record of 7-2 with a 2.18 ERA and 10 saves.</p>\n<p>The starting pitcher Nelson would pitch well, but had a short leash going only going four innings, giving up one run off five hits. The one run from Nelson would come from LMU’s Billy Wilson who singled, got bunted over to second base, stole third base and reached home on an infield play.</p>\n<p>Nelson, a former closer, threw a total of 54 pitches. Expect Nelson to gradually go deeper into games as he becomes more comfortable with his starting pitching role.</p>\n<p>Right-hander Steven Ledesma, a junior college transfer from Santa Barbara City College, came in to relieve Nelson.  Ledesma would make a case of his own as a potential starter going four innings, allowing three hits, no runs, with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Although the Chos’ pitched extremely well, game two was all about LMU Senior Brenton Arriaga.  The lefty, who had all 4 of his pitches at his command, would go the distance striking out 9 batters while shutting out the Gauchos. The Gaucho’s would collect only 3 hits in 9 innings, 2 by Fisher (2-4, 2B) and one by Michael McAdoo (1-3). The Gauchos would lose a tough one by a 1-0 score.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the rubber match of the series would continue with Gaucho offensive woes. Through nine innings, the Gauchos mustered up only two runs off four hits, two of the four hits coming from left fielder Colton Burns (2-4).  On the other side of the diamond, the Lions tee’d off on the Gauchos’ pitching.</p>\n<p>In an offensive explosion lead by LMU second baseman Phil Caulfield (4-5, 3 Runs, 1 RBI), the Lions would go on to score 8 runs (6 earned) on 9 hits. UCSB’s starting pitcher, Joe Record, would get the loss only going 3.2 innings while giving up 4 runs (3 earned) off 4 hits. The Gaucho’s would lose the rubber match and the series by a score of 8-2.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s a little bit frustrated. You know, I don’t think we play the way we wanted to play,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We weren’t sharp defensively, got it handed to us a little bit offensively, so I think the positive to it is it’s a wake up call.  We got work to do.”</p>\n<p>While not the start the Gauchos envisioned, there are still 53 games left on the schedule to prove to everyone if they belong. UCSB will be back in action Tuesday, Feb. 21 at CSU Bakersfield for a 6 p.m. start.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/","id":4209,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.
