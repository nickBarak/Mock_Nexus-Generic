\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman defender Lucas Gonzalez got the first start of his career at left-back after playing great in both of the exhibition games prior to Friday. The LA Galaxy product is a promising prospect for UCSB, giving the team some speed and goalscoring ability in the backline. He started off playing great against the Rebels however in the 8th minute he contested a ball in the air and awkwardly landed on his ankle when he came down. This took him out of the game, and could hold him out for an extended period of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His injury sucked the life out of the Gauchos early in the game, but their defense held strong for most of the first half. The Rebels had their best goalscoring opportunity in the 44th minute when junior midfielder Marcos Gonzalez rocketed a shot off the post, and the Gauchos actually went into halftime leading 55-45 in possession even though they hadn’t played their best soccer yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB came running out of the gates for the second half, and in the 47th minute looked to have their first goal of the regular season when forward Rodney Michael sent a perfect chip to a wide-open Thibault Candia in the box. Candia was one-on-one with goalkeeper Enrique Adame, yet the midfielder whiffed on the volley leading to an easy save.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inability to convert in the final third was a concerning theme for the Gauchos for the first 87 minutes. There were three plays in the first ten minutes of the second half alone where UCSB had the ball in the box with a clean look that they couldn’t put in the back of the net, and although chemistry and sharpness will surely improve as the season goes on, the team really can’t afford to keep missing opportunities if they want to win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second major roadblock for the Gauchos came in the 54th minute when senior defender Faouzi Taieb left the game with an apparent hamstring injury. Taieb is a key player both on offense and defense for UCSB, and with him out for the next few games the team will have to put that much more effort in on both ends to keep things running smoothly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the game wore on and injuries piled up for the Gauchos there was a huge momentum swing in favor of the Rebels. Starting in the 63rd minute UNLV had an almost 20-minute stretch of straight up pressure on the UCSB defense, until the 80th minute when freshman Hayden Prasad curled in a cross which forward Bryan Martinez-Serrano headed home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal was a wake-up call for the Gauchos, and they turned on the jets themselves, eventually leading to an Ignacio Tellechea strike in the 87th minute past the Rebels goalkeeper’s outstretched arms to send the game into overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB almost put the game away in the first four minutes of OT when junior transfer Ameyawu Muntari was brought down in the box, however Michael sent the penalty kick that they were awarded soaring over the bar. Finally with just three minutes left in the second overtime period, forward Will Baynham got to play hero for the Gauchos when he knocked in a loose ball in the box to give them the 2-1 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a quick 48 hour turn-around for the Gauchos as they had to face off against a tough Virginia Tech team on Sunday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB struck first in this game in the 4th minute when Muntari took the ball down the left wing and sent a cross in that took a slight deflection off of a Hokie defender and found the back of the net. The Ghanian transfer from Santa Barbara City College has been a pleasant surprise early on this season, using his speed and technical ability with both feet to create a ton of opportunities on offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was all downhill from there for the Gauchos however, as Virginia Tech would go on to score three unanswered goals to win the game 3-1. Senior Jon Ingason would be the one to open up the scoring for the Hokies in the 7th minute as he struck a free kick from 25 yards out into the upper right corner of the goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second goal would come in the 65th minute when senior forward James Kasak, who just terrorized the depleted Gauchos backline all game long, crossed the ball into the box and UCSB defender Hunter Ashworth’s attempted clearance rocketed into the back of the net for an own goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the last goal for the Hokies in the 74th minute, a tap-in by forward Jacob Labovitz after a Ben Roach free-kick save, essentially put the game out of reach, the setup to the free kick actually had larger implications. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virginia Tech was awarded a free kick only because of a frustration foul by Ashworth after a verbal altercation with Hokie forward Brendan Moyers. The Gauchos have struggled with keeping a lid on their tempers before, but they really can’t afford to give up set-pieces and fouls out of anger, especially with Taieb out for the foreseeable future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although they let their emotions get the best of them on Sunday night, UCSB will look to get back on track this Saturday when they take on UC Berkeley at Harder Stadium.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

At the head of the Bruin tennis squad is freshman Ena Shibahara, who is ranked #4 in the country in singles play.

In doubles play, Santa Barbara tandem Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic have won two out of the three doubles matches they have played so far this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to Stojic and Dubavets, the Gauchos also have the talented pair of Melissa Baker and Stephanie Yamada is coming off of their first win in doubles play as their victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks last weekend ended their losing streak of two games. In singles play, the Gauchos are looking to rebound after dropping five out of the six sets to the Gamecocks.</p>\n<p>Playing against the #24 Bruins will be yet another test for the Gauchos as they are in the midst of an extremely tough schedule. In their first 3 games of the season the UCSB Gauchos have lost every game and, although they are still remaining competitive in their meets, the consecutive losses have made for a difficult start to the season. The Gauchos will finally be able to return home after this upcoming game, a change that could be good for the Gauchos as their road trip comes to a close.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will play the UCLA Bruins on Friday, February 3rd at 1:30 PM PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75490\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/75490/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75490\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/75490/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/75490/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/75490/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/75490/","id":69,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[68,67,66],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Rubber Match Against Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Softball_vsSanDiego-DustinHarris-03312015-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Softball_vsSanDiego-DustinHarris-03312015-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After splitting Friday's doubleheader, the Gauchos came out on the losing end Saturday to fall to 2-4 in conference play.

Pingree was awarded the win for UCSB after giving up three runs in six innings pitched, and freshman Lindsey Chalmers took the loss for Cal Poly after pitching a complete game.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s opener, Cal Poly jumped on the Gauchos early and UCSB was simply never able to come back. After sophomore outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa hit an RBI single to give UCSB a one-run lead in the top of the third, Cal Poly delivered a four-run inning in the bottom of the third to take the lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos made one last attempt to come back in the top of the seventh, but it was simply too little too late. Down 5-1, Clark hit an RBI single and UCSB scored on a fielder’s choice to cut the lead to just two. However, the rally would fall short and the game would end with a Cal Poly victory.</p>\n<p>Although the series was lost, UCSB did show bright spots this weekend. Ludlow pitched fantastically, only giving up four runs across 7.1 innings pitched this weekend. Senior utility Shelby Wisdom also remained hot with the bat, hitting her seventh home run of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host Cal State Northridge beginning this Saturday at noon.</p><div

The Spartans began the year on a road trip where they won the first game and dropped the second one. The Spartans’ last two games have been postponed and they have not played in a tennis meet since Jan. 24.</p>\n<p>Despite the small sample size currently shown by the Spartans, their team is comprised of some talented players. In the singles rankings, SJSU has No. 96 junior Sybille Gauvain who has the capability to defeat higher nationally ranked players than her, as shown in her record against top 100 players last fall. The San Jose State Spartans also have the nationally ranked tandem of freshman Tamara Culibrk and sophomore Miyo Kobayashi who are ranked No. 41 in the ITA Doubles Rankings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos matchup well with the Spartans as their talent in doubles and singles play is something that gives them a chance to pick up their first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic came away with losses in both singles and doubles play in last weekend’s game against UCLA, but the upcoming game against SJSU could be a perfect opportunity for the pair to rebound with victories in both categories of play.</p>\n<p>The Arizona Wildcats have been perfect so far this season. The Wildcats have played all of their five games at home and have won every single meet. Paving the way for the Wildcats’ success is their talented singles play made up of nationally ranked No. 18 senior Lauren Marker and No. 89 senior Samantha Czarniak.</p>\n<p>The talented seniors have not lost a singles match all season as they have either won their matches or the games were left unfinished. Marker and Czarniak are also doubles partners, and while they have not been as successful in doubles play as they have been in singles play, the duo remains a formidable opponent.</p>\n<p>The Wildcats will be playing only their second away game when they square off against UCSB, a new dynamic that could present a problem for Arizona as they look to remain perfect. UCSB’s return back home after a long road trip could also help fuel the Gauchos in their quest for their first victory of the season.</p>\n<p>Matchup-wise, the Gauchos don’t have the nationally ranked singles players that the Wildcats do, but that shouldn’t be a knock on the capability of UCSB in singles play as they have their own stable of talented singles players. In doubles play, Santa Barbara’s nationally ranked pair of No. 33 senior Melissa Baker and sophomore Stephanie Yamada have enjoyed wins in two of the Gauchos last games.
