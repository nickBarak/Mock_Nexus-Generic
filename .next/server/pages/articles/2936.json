Students and faculty also talked about the presence of undocumented students on campus and the positive influence immigrants have had on Santa Barbara’s economy.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sociology professor William Robinson said Obama has been known as the deportation president to many undocumented individuals, with more deportations occurring under his administration than any other, according to Robinson.</p>\n<p>“On the one hand he’s talking about the rights of immigrants and he’s giving temporary residency to some immigrants that meet certain conditions,” Robinson said. “Yet on the other hand, he’s deported more immigrants than any other president in about fifty to sixty years.”</p>\n<p>Robinson said immigrants to the U.S. have become the “scapegoat” for the multitude of financial and economic problems the country is currently facing, all of which are reflected in Obama’s immigration policies.</p>\n<p>“First, it’s generating a great humanitarian crisis for 12 million immigrants in the country and their families, and second, immigrants play an absolutely crucial role in sustaining the U.S., and for that matter the global economy,” Robinson said. “Third, these mass deportations without the due process is violation of international law.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, in order to fix what he calls the mass deportation issue in the U.S., the government must enforce a suspension on all raids and deportations of undocumented citizens. He also said undocumented individuals should have full labor, civil and political rights including automatic residency to undocumented citizens that have no record of criminal activity in the form of an easier pathway to citizenship than current exists.</p>\n<p>“This notion that you can divide the global population to citizen and immigrant is an outdated notion and one that is creating a new access of inequality worldwide,” Robinson said, “Inequality between citizens who have all these rights and immigrants who don’t have any of those rights.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them. – MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robinson said it is vital that students understand issues surrounding mass deportation as urgent social and political issues that directly affect students and faculty at the university.</p>\n<p>“We have both documented and undocumented immigrants right here on campus, so they should be sensitive and aware of this issue and what’s at stake,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion Golash-Boza cited the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 as a starting point of racialized immigration policy in the U.S. and said that, fast-forwarding to the present day, even without a specific law stating that deportation is exclusive to a certain ethnic group, evidence shows that a majority of recent U.S. deportations have been of individuals of Latino descent.</p>\n<p>“Even though [the government] can’t directly create a law that says, ‘We aren’t going to target Latinos,’ it’s still able to happen,” Golash-Boza said. “The racial contours of immigration policy have changed, but it’s still constant.”</p>\n<p>MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau said part of the MCC’s mission is to bring attention to issues involving underrepresented populations in America.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing our part here in our community by bringing in speakers to address these hard issues,” Thibdeau said. “Mass deportation is a very sensitive topic that can be very political, but we aren’t afraid of those type of topics.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out. – Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thibdeau also said the MCC wanted to make sure students are informed of the impact governmental policies can have on the nation.</p>\n<p>“We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them,” Thibdeau said. “There may be students here that aren’t citizens for example, or maybe their parents aren’t, so it’s a very important issue to make sure we’re all aware of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar said Golash-Boza’s discussion did a great job of explaining the essential role global capitalism has on minorities, although she also excluded some specific details.</p>\n<p>“I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out,” Salazar said. “For example, the Undocumented Youth Movement and different groups who have passed a lot of laws like the Trust Act and the new law AB60.”</p>\n<p>According to Salazar, students need to become more aware of the presence of undocumented students on campus as well as of the vital role the Santa Barbara immigrant community plays in supporting the local economy.</p>\n<p>“Whether [the students] are invested in the <em>News-Press</em> or other types of institutions, its foundation is immigrant community but at the same time its racism against the immigrant community,” Salazar said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Matthew Avalos said the discussion touched on his personal experiences as well as on the history of deportation he has learned from his classes at the university.</p>\n<p>“I am Hispanic myself and I have a lot of Hispanic friends, so I’ve heard stories of parents of friends who thought they could get deported,” Avalos said. “I just didn’t know that it had blown up to this extent and turned into such a massive problem.”</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The products are located in all of the Chi-5 residence halls, including San Nicholas Hall (above). <em>Courtesy of Wiki Commons</em></p></div>\n<p>The program is currently limited to the Channel Island 5 residence halls – Anacapa Hall, Santa Cruz Hall, Santa Rosa Hall, San Miguel Hall and San Nicholas Hall – but hopes to expand to Manzanita Village and the Santa Catalina Towers during Winter Quarter 2019.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz Hall Representative-At-Large Michelle Chang first proposed the idea during the 2017-2018 school year. The initiative was continued this year by Programming Vice President Austin Rowe of the Residential Housing Association (RHA).</p>\n<p>Rowe says the point of the Period Pantry is simple: to “provide a large amount of free menstrual hygiene products in all female-identified and gender-neutral restrooms in the residence halls for anyone who needs them to use.”</p>\n<p>The program provides plastic boxes, located in each of the Channel Island 5 residence halls, stocked with a variety of period products for residents.</p>\n<p>According to Rowe, the Pantry began last year in San Nicolas and San Miguel, but it wasn’t until Fall Quarter 2018 that the program began in full with the addition of Period Peers. The peers are student volunteers who are responsible for restocking the restrooms daily.</p>\n<p>Each volunteer is assigned to a particular restroom in their respective residential halls. They have a bag of excess pads and tampons distributed by RHA at the ready so they can restock the boxes as regularly as possible.</p>\n<p>The Period Peer program is completely volunteer-based. Kaitlyn Medland, San Miguel RHA President and member of the Internal Committee for the Period Pantry, was in charge of gathering volunteers for the program in San Miguel Hall.</p>\n<p>The selection process was very much on a first come, first served basis, Medland said.</p>\n<p>Medland and Rowe both described the implementation of the Period Pantry as an administrative and student-led process.</p>\n<p>After Chang’s initial proposal, all the presidents, representatives-at-large and other special positions from each residential hall gathered to discuss the motion and vote for whether it would receive RHA funding or not.</p>\n<p>The members ultimately voted yes, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“The way I see it, the Period Pantry is making the most of our residents’ funds, giving them easy access to a wide range of supplies,” Rowe said.</p>\n<p>And thus far, it seems that students are on board with the program, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve actually heard a lot of people say that it’s really neat that we’re offering these supplies,” she said. “We have the free condom boxes and yet we [didn’t] have free menstrual supplies even though … you can’t stop your period.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/","id":2933,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2932,2931,2930],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Groups that were partially funded included Sigma Chi Omega, Raices De Mi Tierra, Dance Marathon, the Hong Kong Student Association, Alpha Kappa Psi, Theta Nu Kappa and the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega requested funding for $5,800 and received $2,669 for their 17th annual Multicultural Show Feb 21 in Campbell Hall. According to committee member Nadia Blant, Campbell Hall is an expensive venue to fund, therefore the committee deferred on funding the entire event.</p>\n<p>“I think the venue is super expensive and because they are multicultural, there is a lot of places they could go,” Blant said, “I think we need to cut if we are going to make all these events work, so I would fund the venue but not the performing actors.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Raices De Mi Tierra received $12,000 from their requested $15,200, while Dance Marathon requested $4,350 and received $4,150 when the committee decided not to give them $200 in material costs for the event on Feb 28 at Pavilion Gym. Dance Marathon Chair Sean Thompson, who asked for funding from the committee, said Dance Marathon is “the largest collegiate charity in the nation and is present in over 250 campuses nationwide.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB. – Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We work through Children’s Miracle Network, which is a network of hospitals that are children’s hospitals and our local chapter is Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Hospital, so all of the proceeds through our Dance Marathon event go to them,” Thompson said, “My favorite part is that we bring the kids from the hospital too, so you get to meet them, dance with them and play with them.”</p>\n<p>The Hong Kong Student Association asked for $3,970 and received $1,120 for the annual Lunar New Year festival on Feb. 12 at Storke Plaza and are expecting about 200 people. According to Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam, the event’s purpose is to “emulate the festival atmosphere of a traditional Asian Lunar New Year festival by bringing UCSB our cultural foods, performances, music, games and activities.”</p>\n<p>“Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB,” Tam said.</p>\n<p>Alpha Kappa Psi received $242 from their requested $282, the $40 difference due to the committee’s inability to fund water bottles for a Coffee and Donuts event on Feb 26 in the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge.</p>\n<p>“We are hosting a professional development night open to all students. We will be hosting workshops that help fill resumes, give interview tips, stuff like that,” said a speaker for Alpha Kappa Psi.</p>\n<p>Theta Nu Kappa’s speaker third-year feminist studies and political science major Derek Wakefield received $410 for a Quidditch tournament after the committee could not fund them $75 for water bottles.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing in a sport that has never been seen, except for with the Quidditch team, but they have not had as many really wide open tournaments open at the university,” Wakefield said. “We want to make this an event that can really persist throughout the years and be something that you know people think, ‘Oh I am going to go to the Quidditch tournament like it becomes a Santa Barbara staple.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60141\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60141\" data-attachment-id=\"60141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-hears-requests/finance-board/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422350836\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Finance Board\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60141\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=440%2C293\" alt=\"A.S.

href=\"https://twitter.com/islavistaparty/status/1079173142680002565\">Twitter</a>, the party announced that the two members – Associated Students (A.S.) Internal Vice President Steven Ho and External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect (EVPSA) Mayela Morales – were removed due to Title IX-related violations and “unprofessionalism that has come to light,” according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The two were removed from the party during summer 2018, the statement said. This is the first time the Isla Vista Party publicly announced the decision.</p>\n<p>According to Ho, he was first informed of his removal by the social media posts.</p>\n<p>“I was unaware of my removal until the statement released by leadership of the party,” he said.</p>\n<p>When Ho reached out to party leadership to discuss the matter, he was told “that someone was supposed to talk to me and poor communication within the party resulted in that not happening.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Party did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>Morales declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> from the EVPSA position after it was discovered she was not enrolled at UC Santa Barbara during Spring Quarter 2018. She currently serves as the Parliamentarian for the A.S. Senate and as the Chief of Staff for the Office of the Student Advocate.</p>\n<p>In the statement, the Isla Vista Party (IVP) apologized for not previously announcing the removal of the two members and “for contributing to community members feeling unsafe in student government spaces due to this.”</p>\n<p>This is the second instance of separation between parties and high-profile members to occur during winter break.
