[As for rebounding], that’s just my focus every game is to really crash the boards and rebound.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed why they are the best defensive team in the Big West in the first half, holding the Matadors to just 14 points. Santa Barbara forced 14 turnovers and held a 14-0 points off turnovers advantage while holding Northridge to 23.1 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“Their guards want to dribble penetrate and get to the paint and either get to the free throw line or kick for threes,” Mitchell said. We’re pretty disciplined most of the time when guarding that style of play.”</p>\n<p>After two disappointing losses to Cal Poly and Hawaii in its last two games, UCSB came out hot, jumping out to a quick 8-0 advantage. The Gauchos continued to extend their lead, taking a dominant 34-14 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>However, to open the second half, the tables turned and it was CSUN that came out on the attack, going on an 8-0 run. Using its press and picking up the defensive intensity, the Matadors forced nine UCSB turnovers in the first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>“When you’re up, and you start playing not to lose or not to turn the ball over or not understanding when to attack sometimes that messes with your mind a bit, and that did with our guards for a short spell there,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Even with a momentum switch, the game was still in the Gauchos’ control as the lead remained in double digits. Northridge continued knock on the door though, knocking down three consecutive treys with 2:28 remaining to close the gap to 10. In the second half, Northridge was 7-15 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Santa Barbara hit eight of its 10 free throws down the stretch to clinch the 66-55 victory.</p>\n<p>“Probably the only negative for me (today) was the last five minutes, giving up so many threes,” Mitchell said. “We have to find a way to put teams away and let the scoreboard really show how we controlled the game form the tip to the final buzzer.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos shot 43.4 percent from the field. Recording 18 assists on its 23 field goals, the 66 points were UCSB’s second-highest point total of the season.</p>\n<p>Along with Underwood’s standout performance, junior guard Nicole Nesbit contributed 11 points and a team-high five assists. The bench was also key for UCSB, tallying 21 points. In fact, nine of the 10 players that stepped on the court for the Gauchos scored at least three points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now embark on its final regular season road trip, traveling to Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared on page 5 of February 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/underwood-carries-gauchos-to-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/underwood-carries-gauchos-to-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/underwood-carries-gauchos-to-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/underwood-carries-gauchos-to-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-24/underwood-carries-gauchos-to-victory/","id":646,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[645,644,643],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Go For 41st Straight Over CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After continuing its streak against Northridge last Saturday, winning its 13th straight against the Matadors, the UCSB women’s basketball team has another winning streak to defend tonight when the t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After continuing its streak against Northridge last Saturday, winning its 13th straight against the Matadors, the UCSB women’s basketball team has another winning streak to defend tonight when the team tries for its 41st consecutive victory over Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Dating back to the 1995-96 season, the win streak is the second best nationwide, trailing only Stanford’s 53 straight victories over Washington State.

Nevertheless, UCSB knows it cannot take any team for granted.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like we are going in to this game undefeated,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Our kids understand that different teams present different problems and we had our hands full with Fullerton last time, so there’s absolutely no reason to overlook them.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met in the Thunderdome, UCSB took an early lead, but gave it up in the second half. With the score knotted up at 40, Mitchell made a five man line change, subbing in the reserves. They finished the game on a 12-4 run and earned UCSB a 60-50 win.</p>\n<p>“We got complacent going into the second half,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “That [can’t] happen, especially at the end of the season. Every team is vying for that spot at the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, a glaring statistic for the Gauchos was rebounding as the Titans outrebounded Santa Barbara 40-30, including 20-4 on the offensive glass, which resulted in 23 second chance points for Fullerton compared to just four for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Therefore, rebounding will most likely be the biggest key to the game for the Gauchos. The Titans rank third in the Big West in rebounding margin at +1.6 and lead the conference in offensive boards with 17.9 per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB features two of the best rebounders in the conference as senior forward Sweets Underwood ranks fourth in the league with 9.4 rebounds per game and Tilleman ranks ninth with 7.1.</p>\n<p>Tilleman and Underwood will be crucial for the Gauchos inside offensively as well, as Fullerton is a smaller team known for its quick guards. In the last matchup, Tilleman scored a season-high 16 points on 4-7 shooting and the two combined for 26 points.</p>\n<p>“Our philosophy is always inside out and we understand that when we establish our inside game early, it makes it a lot easier for our guards to get open jumpers,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is set for 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50402\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50402\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/","id":643,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[642,641,640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Get Revenge Against Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0565.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball_MarkBrocher_02.21.2013_DSC_0565.jpg?resize=400%2C599&ssl=1","description":"After a horrible loss to Cal State Fullerton Thursday that broke a 40-game winning streak, the UCSB women’s basketball team responded in dominating fashion Saturday, defeating UC Riverside 62-42.

Using 13-3 and 9-0 runs, the Gauchos doubled up on Riverside 28-14 and eventually took a 32-17 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>“Coming off a bad game, we came out this afternoon with a chip on our shoulder, knowing that we had to come out fired up because the effort we came out with [against Fullerton] was unacceptable,” Nesbit said.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB shot an incredible 53.6 percent from the field in the first half, compared to 25 percent from Riverside.</p>\n<p>“We just pushed. We didn’t think about anything,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “We didn’t run plays; it was just transition. We were attacking and had a lot of points in the paint, so I think that’s what led to the win.”</p>\n<p>While in the past, the Gauchos have often started the second half complacent when they have held large leads and have watched their advantage disappear, UCSB continued to keep its foot on the gas, extending its lead to as many as 21 points with 14:13 remaining.</p>\n<p>“[At halftime], I just challenged them that it was zero to zero,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I wanted them to understand that when you get a team down and you’re on their court, [you have to] to put them away and the upperclassmen accepted that challenge. Even when UCR made a couple runs, you could see the look on their face like ‘we’re not going to let this happen again.’”</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB outshot Riverside 46.7 to 35.6 percent and outscored the Highlanders 30-14 in the paint.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara featured three players in double figures with junior guard Melissa Zornig and Mason each tallying 10, but it was Nesbit who had the hot hand for UCSB, scoring 20 points, which ties her career-high. Nesbit also finished with three assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“She has the ability to score points on any given night,” Mitchell said. “But for me, the importance was that she got after it on the defensive end of things and controlled the tempo with her calmness on the ball.”</p>\n<p>Mason also stood out for UCSB, starting for the Gauchos and recording a double-double. Along with her 10 points, she grabbed 12 rebounds, breaking her previous career-high of 10.</p>\n<p>“I just felt real free today,” Mason said. “It was fun and I’m glad I could do it in front of my family. My focus was going after everything.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos held the Highlanders to 35.6 percent shooting and forced 19 turnovers, compared to just 10 for UCSB. Santa Barbara also outrebounded Riverside 36-27.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 11 steals is the most ever during Mitchell’s reign.</p>\n<p>“I’m satisfied with the way our kids recovered after a disappointing loss,” Mitchell said. “They came out extremely focused and competitive, so overall, I’m satisfied with our play and of course, the outcome.”</p>\n<p>Next week, UCSB returns home for its final games of the regular season, hosting Long Beach State and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50444\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50444\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/gauchos-get-revenge-against-riverside/","id":644,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[643,642,641],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Blow Lead, Drop Third Straight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"For a struggling UCSB men’s basketball team, a break from conference play for the ESPN BracketBuster game could have been a chance to gain confidence heading into the homestretch of the season.

Taylor knocked down a three to spark a 10-2 run for the Gauchos. By halftime, Santa Barbara had maintained the lead, taking a 29-21 advantage. In the first half, the Gauchos outshot the Hornets 38.5 to 20.0 percent.</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story as UCSB was outshot 45.8 percent to 28 percent. The Hornets also shot 40 percent from downtown.</p>\n<p>Despite opening the second half with the same fire they came out with in the first and taking its largest lead of the game at 12 points with 15:18 to go, sophomore guard Mikh McKinney knocked down a jumper that sparked a 14-3 run by the Hornets. The Gauchos’ 12-point lead quickly became just one with 5:44 to go.</p>\n<p>“We took really poor care of the basketball when we were up. We took casual shots, quick threes and we had turnovers that led them right back into the game,” Coach Williams said. “They fought and scrapped. We were outcoached, we were outplayed and we were outhustled.”</p>\n<p>With the gap still just one point with three minutes left, Sacramento’s leading scorer, senior forward John Dickson, drained a three with just over a minute and a half to go to give the Hornets their first lead of the game at 45-47.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB fed sophomore center Alan Williams in the post, who converted a hook shot on the right block to tie the game at 47 all. Dickson countered for the Hornets with a reverse layup, but with 17 seconds remaining, freshman forward Taran Brown hit a clutch three from deep on the left wing to take a 50-49 lead.</p>\n<p>“We just ran a play called money, which gets us a lot of open threes in the corner,” Brown said. “My guy didn’t end up coming with me on that screen on the bottom block and I was able to get the open shot.”</p>\n<p>With the final possession, senior center Konnor Veteto came out to set a screen for sophomore guard Dylan Garrity for Sacramento. Big Al helped hedge, trying to trap Garrity, but Garrity got around the two Gaucho defenders to find Veteto wide open for a layup on the right block.</p>\n<p>“Al trapped, per design on the on ball screen and our wings stood and watched,” Coach Williams said. “Nobody rotated, so it’s a pretty big breakdown.”</p>\n<p>While the Hornets had four players in double figures, Brown was the only player to do so for UCSB, tallying a game-high 18 points. Taylor finished with nine points as well as six assists. Big Al really struggled for UCSB.
