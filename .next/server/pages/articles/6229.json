Mindfulness, according to UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center, is “the moment-by-moment process of actively and openly observing one’s physical, mental and emotional experiences.” Practicing mindfulness has proven to lead to significant positive health effects including stress reduction, improved concentration and a better understanding of thoughts and feelings. These benefits would greatly improve the quality of life for many UCSB students and would help them deal with the everyday challenges of a college lifestyle. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a high stress level is one of the most ubiquitous issues among college students, and it can lead to many negative health effects like illness, anxiety and depression. According to the 2015 National College Health Assessment, 53.5 percent of college students reported feeling “more than average stress” or “tremendous stress” over the span of the year. Practicing mindfulness is a useful tool to manage this large amount of stress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By training one’s mind to concentrate on one topic at a time, it helps sort the constant stream of thoughts and tasks that clutter our minds each day. Though many students already have tools to cope with stress, I encourage the adoption of mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. It goes beyond stress reduction, with the potential to improve things like focus, empathy, relationship satisfaction, immune function and emotional responsiveness instead of emotional reaction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Additionally, in a recent mindful meditation lunch sponsored by the Women’s Center, Christina McMahon of the UCSB Department of Theater and Dance discussed the idea of compassion and kindness toward one’s self. She conveyed that studies have shown that you are more likely to show deeper compassion and kindness to others if you are compassionate toward yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an aspect of mindfulness that I truly want to highlight. Being compassionate toward yourself often times proves much more difficult than displaying compassion to others. It is easy for us as students to become absorbed with academic goals, extracurricular activities, work etc., and even easier to beat ourselves up when we don’t meet expectations. Thus, learning to embrace who we are and where we are in life will not only improve our quality of life, but the quality of life for our community as well as. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mindful meditation, in many ways, can help students make more meaningful connections to themselves and others, grow as individuals and thrive in daily life. This is why Health &amp; Wellness is dedicated to providing students the opportunity to practice guided mindful meditation at least two times a week. Our Community Mindfulness Practices are led by mindfulness experts from the Santa Barbara and Goleta community, including Dawa Tarchin Phillips and Spencer Sherman. Additionally, one Community Mindfulness Practice per week incorporates a focus on social justice, which allows students to learn how to apply mindfulness to advocating for social change in their communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those unfamiliar with mindfulness or meditation, each Community Mindfulness Practice lasts one hour and begins with a short dharma talk. These talks span approximately five minutes and introduce the topic of mindfulness meditation to students, outlining what to expect. The next 15-20 minutes consist of a meditation where the community expert guides you through the process, allowing you to expand your mindfulness skills. Finally, the hour is wrapped up with a discussion about the experience, whether it was good or bad and how it personally affected those who participated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any and all students interested in mindfulness are welcome to join Health &amp; Wellness in these Community Mindfulness Practices on Tuesdays in the SRB Student Conference Room from 1:05-1:50 p.m. or Fridays in South Hall, Room 1632 from 1-2 p.m. The events are a secular, safe space for all to come and enjoy an hour of tranquil reflection and discussion. Light snacks and beverages will also be provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These Community Mindfulness Practices are a great resource for any student looking for a way to improve their mental, emotional or physical well-being. I encourage all students to leave their predispositions at the door and see what mindfulness can do for you. It truly is for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><em>Carly Bertolozzi is an intern for UCSB’s Health and Wellness Programs.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75137\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75137\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-24/ucsb-health-and-wellness-practicing-mindfulness/","id":6229,"author":{"id":648,"name":"Carly Bertolozzi"},"related":[6228,6227,6226],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":648,"name":"Carly Bertolozzi","biography":"Not available","articles":[6229],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Traveling Gaucho Witnesses Reality of Middle East Conflicts","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After studying abroad for six months in the heart of “the holy land,” Jerusalem, I would like to share some insight into the real situation on the ground in Israel. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After studying abroad for six months in the heart of “the holy land,” Jerusalem, I would like to share some insight into the real situation on the ground in Israel. Most students with busy lives have very little time between sips of beer and Four Loko (R.I.P.) to read the extensive histories of every modern conflict. Instead we must rely on the media to give us the SparkNoted version. Unfortunately, the media sometimes fails to act responsibly in delivering the “big picture” of a conflict to unsuspecting readers. The point of this article is not to be condescending, but to share my account as a foreigner witnessing firsthand the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>\n<p>I have studied and toured extensively Israel/Palestine and some of its neighbors, much to the chagrin of my parents (My mom every other week: “You went where?!”). I have seen riots unfold in the Old  City and near my dorms, as well as witnessed bomb squads blow up suspicious packages from my window. I have walked and driven through hundreds of Israeli checkpoints and spoken with many Palestinians and Israelis. I have tried my hardest to get the most out of my experience here in the Middle East, both intellectually and emotionally. I can confidently say that the situation here should be viewed with great optimism, but also with sensitive empathy.</p>\n<p>When I sit down to eat lunch in the (awesomely delicious) student cafeteria on campus, I cannot help but feel strong emotions as I see a growing line of students waiting for their bags to be searched by an Uzi-wielding guard before they can eat. The cafeteria had been the site of a horrific bombing no more than eight years ago during the second intifada, killing nine students and wounding almost a hundred.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Obama’s current political plight is a prime example of this as people generally care more about the federal deficit than his accomplishments in the international environment. Just checking the front page of an Israeli newspaper, such as <em>Haaretz,</em> an Arab newspaper like <em>Al-Jazeera</em> or speaking with an Israeli or Palestinian, will show the dedication of both parties to studying and solving the conflict.</p>\n<p>Asking if Israelis OR Palestinians care about peace is as ridiculous a question as asking if a homeless person cares about his next meal. Let’s try to be more vigilant discussing other cultures, conflicts and histories. Let us step out of our bubble and intentionally put ourselves in vulnerable positions for the sake of understanding cultures different from our own, so that we may gain some much needed perspective that is not spoon-fed to us by <em>Time</em>, CNN or Fox News.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/","id":6226,"author":{"id":594,"name":"Daniel Aaronson"},"related":[6225,6224,6223],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Secretary of Labor Defends Healthcare Reform Provisions","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act a year ago this week.

The law enacts significant health insurance reforms that will take effect over the next several years. But one very important piece of that law is already in place, and it may directly benefit you.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act ensures that college students and young adults can stay on their parents’ employer-provided health care plans until age 26. In years prior, many health plans and issuers dropped young adults from their parents’ policies because of their age. That left countless college students, recent college graduates and other young people with little recourse — and worse: no health insurance. Historically, some 30 percent of young adults have been uninsured, a rate far higher than that of any other age group.</p>\n<p>But young people don’t need health insurance, right? The statistics say otherwise: One in six young adults today is faced with a chronic illness such as cancer, diabetes or asthma, and nearly half of uninsured young adults report problems paying medical bills.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The new law ensures you have an option when it comes to your health care. This is important as you continue through school, as well as when you transition into the job market, since you may find that health care coverage is not immediately available through your employer. Or you may work part time. You may choose to continue your education and go to graduate school, or take time off to travel and pursue volunteer opportunities.</p>\n<p>It allows you to remain on your parents’ plan, or rejoin it until age 26, even if you no longer live with your parents, are not a dependent on their tax return or are no longer a student. This new flexibility even applies if you are married. You are guaranteed the same benefits and at the same price that is available to other dependents.</p>\n<p>More health care improvements are on the way and many may also directly benefit you. Already, coverage cannot be denied for those under age 19 because of a pre-existing condition. By 2014, denying coverage to anyone based on a pre-existing condition will be banned; annual dollar caps on care, which are already limited, will be prohibited; state-based health insurance exchanges will create a new marketplace, giving more employers and millions of Americans the ability to purchase affordable coverage.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act is based on the simple belief that every American — and that includes college students — deserves access to high-quality, affordable health care. Only one year after it was signed into law, that belief is becoming reality.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/","id":6227,"author":{"id":592,"name":"Hilda L.

The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concludes that 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions result from animal agriculture. By comparison, the EPA attributes 14 percent of emissions to all global transportation systems combined. Our diets clearly have a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">huge </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impact on the planet. In a seminal life-cycle impact assessment, Reijnders and Soret estimated the environmental impact of non-vegetarian meals to be between 1.5 and 2 times worse than vegetarian meals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the urgency of climate change, reducing meat consumption matters even more. The FAO reports that because of belches and manure, livestock accounts for 25 percent of anthropogenic methane emissions. Methane’s half-life in the atmosphere is eight years, compared to 100 years for carbon dioxide, so methane reduction offers a quicker route to curb global warming in the short-term. That is why the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that methane’s Global Warming Potential is 86 times greater than carbon dioxide’s.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing meat consumption also offers nutritional benefits. Though both plant-based and omnivorous diets are only healthy with deliberate effort, it is uncontroversial that most people eat too much meat. According to Johns Hopkins University, the average American eats 50 percent more meat than is needed for protein. (Arguably, any amount of meat is more than needed for protein; legumes and tofu offer comparable protein per calorie.) Yet, meat contains saturated fats that increase risk for heart disease and stroke. The World Health Organization reports that processed meats like bacon and sausage certainly cause cancer and that red meat probably causes cancer, too. Eating more plant-based meals could mitigate this unnecessary risk for heart disease, stroke and cancer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last, we want to discuss animal welfare without going into the graphic details that most readers probably already know. Instead, we’ll say this: To minimize costs and maximize profits, animals are treated like inanimate objects, not living creatures who can suffer. This industry affects the lives of nine billion animals – each the center of a distinct life – every year in the U.S. alone. Any reduction in this unnecessary suffering matters immensely to these animals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all, plant-based diets improve our health, our environment and the welfare of animals. While it is unrealistic to ask people to go veg overnight, a reasonable compromise exists, too: Students can try going meatless on Mondays. Doing so helps you build a repertoire of veg-options that you can rely on later if you do eventually decide to help the environment, the animals and your health by going veg all week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our university has a role to play here as well. In the course of our lives, college offers the best time to experiment with different lifestyles, belief systems and interests since habits – especially dietary habits – tend to become cemented during adulthood. As a result, the university has a unique opportunity and consequently a unique responsibility to assist students trying to reduce their meat consumption.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen and Dining Services have already made commendable progress toward that end. The convenience stores, for example, introduced new vegan options this quarter, and Dining Services goes above and beyond in serving sustainable food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many plant-based Gauchos find that it is easier to eat at home than on campus. To make a plant-based diet easier, convenience stores on campus could carry more than a single vegan green salad; there are eight non-vegan ones. Dining commons could introduce vegan desserts, as UC Davis and UC Berkeley have done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larger projects are also worth considering. UCSB’s Climate Action Report could include food-related emissions under scope-three emissions so we can more effectively monitor our food’s environmental impact. As contracts for red and processed meat expire, Dining Services could commit to replacing at least portions of those ingredients with plant-based ingredients. Such moves, of course, require time and resources to implement; trade-offs always have to be made.
