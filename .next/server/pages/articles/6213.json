Recruiters, hiring managers, clients, colleagues, bosses, graduate school admissions officers and many others are checking you out online.</p>\n<p>Fair or not, what they find will affect their opinion of you. According to a December 2009 Microsoft survey, 79 percent of United States hiring managers and job recruiters reviewed online information about job applicants. And 70 percent said they had actually rejected a job candidate because of something they found about that person online. The rejections may be prompted by situations where applicants have posted inappropriate material, such as party photos, on Facebook or Flickr, or Tweet daily about how much they hate their boss. If you Tweet daily about how much you hate your boss, this makes sense. But what if you’re not doing anything inappropriate? What if someone else with your same name is doing these things?</p>\n<p>You’d be surprised how often we hear this concern from students and recent graduates. The good news is that there are several things you can do to own your online image even if you share ownership of your given name.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t already, find out who else shares your name online. Google your name. You need to know what other people might find —  and might associate with you —  when they search on your name.</p>\n<p>If you find that someone with your identical name is generating negative search results, such as a criminal record or offensive blog posts, you need to take action to make sure people don’t associate these things with you.</p>\n<p>First, set up a Google Alert on your name and any common misspellings of it at www.google.com/alerts. This free service will send you an email whenever your name appears anywhere online in the future. You want to be aware of anything your online doppelganger is doing in case someone asks you about it or you suspect people are mistaking you with this other person. This will also help you track any places you appear online so you can draw more attention to these Web sites.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the next important action: Post more positive and professional things about yourself online. The best way to overcome any negative search results (whether truly yours or owned by someone with your name) is to have more great search results about you. This includes setting up a strong professional LinkedIn profile and being consistently active on the site and setting up a professional Google profile. This also means contributing in a positive way elsewhere on the Web, such as writing book reviews on Amazon.com, commenting on your favorite professional blogs or writing bylined articles for a professional association Web site.</p>\n<p>Third, create a consistent online identity. Choose one version of your name and a middle initial or set of numbers or letters following your name. Use this for your LinkedIn profile, Google profile, Twitter profile and any other place you represent yourself professionally online. For instance, if your name is Jane Doe and there are hundreds of Jane Does online, then you might claim the LinkedIn URL of www.linkedin.com/in/janezdoe if your middle name is Zoe or www.linkedin.com/in/janedoe500 if you like the number 500.</p>\n<p>Professional-looking photos can also help to eliminate any confusion, particularly when you’ve had the opportunity to meet directly with potential employers.<br>\nFinally, and most importantly, be sure to drive people’s attention to the online image you’ve created for yourself. It’s most likely that someone will Google you after having some form of communication from you, so make sure that all of your communications provide people with guidance for finding you online. Add your LinkedIn profile to your resume, business cards, email signature, voice mail message or any place else that represents you to people. When you meet someone in person, you can even say, “I have a really common name, so if you need to find me online, remember that I’m JaneDoe500.”</p>\n<p>If you’re in the opposite situation and have a very uncommon or difficult-to-spell name, the above tips can work for you as well. No matter what your name situation, you must take ownership of how people find and perceive you online. Your name is not just your name; it’s your reputation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28187\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/big-brother-raises-hiring-standards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28187\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/big-brother-raises-hiring-standards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/big-brother-raises-hiring-standards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/big-brother-raises-hiring-standards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/big-brother-raises-hiring-standards/","id":6213,"author":{"id":569,"name":"Holly Paul"},"related":[6212,6211,6210],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":569,"name":"Holly Paul","biography":"Not available","articles":[6213],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"They Don’t Want You to Vote","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/das.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/das.jpg?resize=683%2C392&ssl=1","description":"You would think that making it easier for citizens to vote would be something for everyone in a democracy to celebrate, Democrats and Republicans.

Pappas and Baxter lost.  And then they appealed, again and again, but they never produced a single piece of evidence proving voter fraud.  Supervisor Farr successfully defended all the way up to the Supreme Court our right to vote here.  In the end Pappas and Baxter lost every single court challenge. The trial judge wrote that this case was, “frivolous and tantamount to an intentional misleading of the Court.”  The Santa Ynez Valley News declared this case was, “a legal farce.”</p>\n<p>Now it’s 2016 and the same Terry Baxter is back, recently hired by Bruce Porter who’s, running for 3rd District Supervisor against Joan Hartmann. And under the guise of “voter privacy” Baxter is now leading Porter’s effort to stop students from registering and voting. The fact that Porter hired Baxter is proof that he doesn’t have any intention of truly listening and supporting the people he is running to represent.</p>\n<p>Baxter’s main tactic is distributing written warnings and publishing ads telling students that simply the act of registering to vote risks voters’ privacy. This is ironic since she is the same person who in 2009 subpoenaed UCSB for ALL student enrollment records, including, their names, address and citizenship status. She is also encouraging students to register back “home,” as if Isla Vista is not our home.</p>\n<p>As a long-standing community organizer in Isla Vista, I know that attempting to deprive students of their voting rights is an old and dishonored tradition.  However Pappas, Baxter and now Porter have taken this gutter practice to new lows.  Truth is, fraud in registration and in voting is nearly non-existent in the U.S. and it’s non-existent here.  That’s what judge after judge said in ruling against Baxter and her crew.  And that’s still the case. With their unfounded calls encouraging students to register “back home” and not to trust convenient, local registration drives, Bruce Porter and Terry Baxter are not trying to protect your privacy. They are trying to keep you from voting. It’s disingenuous and fundamentally un-American. These are politically motivated tactics aimed at depriving young people of your constitutional right to vote where you live. Don’t fall for it.</p>\n<p><em>Assemblymember Das Williams represents the 37th District of California, including Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and is a UCSB alumnus.

These proposed cuts in the budget threaten my, as well as many others’, continuing education here at UCSB. As a result of the $500 million reduction in state funding for the UC system, student fees will skyrocket and many services will be taken away completely. These daunting cuts also prevent recent high school graduates  from seeking or being able to afford the education they need to become successful as our future workforce. Many will decide to attend their local community college to get by.</p>\n<p>But wait! That educational system will have $400 million cut as well. Looks like we don’t need competent doctors or lawyers, huh? We need to band together as students, as a community, as people, to spread awareness of the projected death to public higher education. Every single person needs to realize how these policies affect their future and how severe they are. I hope to see our whole campus rallying behind CalPIRG’s Rally for Affordable Education on March 4! This is one of the ways in which our community can reach out and demonstrate how these cuts are not to be tolerated!</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32779\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/students-march-affordable-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32779\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/students-march-affordable-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/students-march-affordable-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/students-march-affordable-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/students-march-affordable-education/","id":6211,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6210,6209,6208],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Underrepresented Secular Ideology Finds Outlet in Column","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"According to a recent U.S. survey, on average atheists and agnostics are more knowledgeable about religions than religious people themselves.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>According to a recent U.S. survey, on average atheists and agnostics are more knowledgeable about religions than religious people themselves. That is to say, they have been exposed to the opinions and beliefs of others more often than the average person of faith and have made a decision not to follow any particular belief system. This survey was conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, so you can rest assured that it is not merely an attack on religious people by science.</p>\n<p>[media-credit id=20177 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/11LTE-AN.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"936150789\" data-slb-group=\"33171\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/11LTE-AN-250x241.jpg?resize=250%2C241\" alt=\"\" title=\"11LTE-AN\" width=\"250\" height=\"241\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33173\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]I have read the Nexus “Ask an Atheist” column and have not seen any replies that directly attack religion, Christianity or otherwise. Rather, these columns are insightful and answer the questions in a clear, concise manner that anyone can read and make a decision about. While I believe that Christians and other students of faith on campus should have the right to reply to the arguments put forth by these atheists, I also believe that most people have heard religious arguments many times in their lives. All you have to do is walk by the UCen or in front of HSSB to receive a pamphlet about how much Jesus loves you, see a poster about a religious talk being given in I.V., etc.</p>\n<p>The appearance of the “Ask an Atheist” column is, perhaps, a reminder that religious folks have questions about why others choose not to participate in religion — questions that are not fairly or adequately answered by faith systems. I choose to be an atheist because I have learned about various world religions, not because I am simply a lost sinner who doesn’t care about my actions. If I believe in anything, it is the universe and the power of love. And if we love our universe, we will find the capacity to care for our planet and the creatures that inhabit it, whether they swim, fly, crawl or go to church.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33171\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-11/underrepresented-secular-ideology-finds-outlet-column/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33171\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-11/underrepresented-secular-ideology-finds-outlet-column/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-11/underrepresented-secular-ideology-finds-outlet-column/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-11/underrepresented-secular-ideology-finds-outlet-column/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-11/underrepresented-secular-ideology-finds-outlet-column/","id":6212,"author":{"id":572,"name":"Mary Bissell"},"related":[6211,6210,6209],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
