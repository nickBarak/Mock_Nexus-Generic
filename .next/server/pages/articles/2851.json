Senate members listen intently as their fellow students present issues to be discussed. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night at the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss resolutions regarding the support of curricular changes in general education, senators’ workload, developments in the i&gt;Clicker rental program, recent grants from the Finance and Business Committee and the development of an A.S. lobbying group.</p>\n<p>The meeting included a debate regarding whether an additional gender and sexuality course should be required for graduation. A.S. Controller and fourth-year electrical engineering major Amir Khazaieli updated the senate on the i&gt;Clicker rental program and continuing issues as the program prepares to be launched. Finance and Business Committee Chair and fourth-year communication major Jimmy Villarreal outlined funding the committee has allotted to student groups this year.</p>\n<p>Senator and fourth-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez informed the senate of developments in Assembly member Das Williams’ Isla Vista self-governance bill AB 3, introduced in the state assembly to make I.V. a Community Services District (CSD). Lopez said the <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/\">recent issuance of a letter of concern</a> from the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a setback in the progression of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“We passed our resolution last Wednesday and then the next day myself and a number of other senators went to the LAFCO meeting. We spoke with a lot of other students and a lot of homeowners, which is big because a lot of homeowners were not down with AB 3 at the beginning,” Lopez said. “We felt that they should not pass a letter of concern, but as it LAFCO’s way, they passed a letter of concern anyway.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said the stakeholders group compiled a list of things they would like to see in the bill language for the CSD and voted to send it to the legislature for potential amendments to keep the bill in action.</p>\n<p>“We had our discussion to find out what is palatable for everyone, sent it in, and then that will be coming back to us hopefully after we have the financial sustainability report,” Lopez said. “Then we can put together the actual bill that will be discussed on the floor.”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini told the Senate about recent developments in her nascent student lobbying group. According to Mancini, the group plans to advocate on behalf of students politically and will be soliciting input from student groups.</p>\n<p>“We filled out a sheet with all the orgs we’re going to reach out to, and there’s quite a few of them, hopefully about 30,” Mancini said. “At our next meeting we’re going to identify our lobby targets so that’s going to be an important meeting.”</p>\n<p>Senators debated the Resolution Supporting the Establishment of a Gender and Sexuality GE Requirement, a resolution that would support additional graduation requirements regarding gender and sexuality courses.</p>\n<p>Lopez said he supports the resolution because it brings wider attention to less recognized courses.“There are classes that already cover these subject matters,” Lopez said. “[We should] just give them more recognition and … get majors that don’t usually deal with these sort of courses the opportunity to. The UC is something that should have more of a holistic education.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he supported the resolution but doubted the level of student support for the idea of advocacy for extra GE courses.</p>\n<p>“I like this resolution. I do want to point that not every student is cool with extra duties,” Villarreal said. “Since they come to school and want to get out of here and get a job and [are] not necessarily going to support extra GEs.”</p>\n<p>Senator and third-year political science and global studies major Kevin Koo said he supported the resolution and that the university’s progressive academic policies is part of his reason for doing so.</p>\n<p>“Universities are meant to grow and that’s the whole point of this,” Koo said. “It stands as a very good example of the generation that we’re in and that this is more and more a growing issue and that’s why I’m personally in favor of it.”</p>\n<p>Koo responded to Villarreal’s concerns about the lack of student support saying students would agree to the take the GE courses if they are presented as simply a regular part of the GE curriculum.</p>\n<p>“If they come in from the start knowing this is a GE, then everyone will just think that’s normal and it’s not like ‘Oh I have to do more work,’” Koo said. “It’s just gonna be ‘Oh yeah this is just part of the GE package.’”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year student Haywood Hunter said he personally supports the resolution, but voted against it citing that his position is to be representative of all students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea, I would vote for it, but I represent a lot of students who would look at this as an attempt to increase units,” Hunter said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau gave a brief summary of an average senator’s workload to address her perception that the student public is not aware of how much work senators do.</p>\n<p>“I’m really concerned that people don’t know what you all do. So I had [Government Affairs advisor] Cory [Graves] help me put together a spreadsheet detailing out how many hours an average senator actually spends doing senate work,” Lau said. “This does not include any time you spent meeting with administrators, any time you spent going to local meetings, or group projects that you all have done.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, senators also spend a lot of time reading emails, preparing for meetings and reviewing previous meetings’ minutes.</p>\n<p>“I know you all get at least 20 emails a day because I get at least 120 emails a day, but I’m sure you each get at least 20 that are relatively important that you have to read,” Lau said. “You all have to read through bills and resolutions as well as all the minutes that are sent out from all the boards and commissions in Associated Students.”</p>\n<p>Lau said it is important for senators to perform their duties on top of their schoolwork.</p>\n<p>“In total, at the very minimum, the average senator spends about 14.8 hours doing senate work,” Lau said. “So I just hope that everyone is aware of that and is aware that we are also students here.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli updated the senate on difficulties regarding the introduction of his <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/\">office’s i&gt;clicker rental program</a>. According to Khazaieli, technical issues with the website have prevented the online sign up process from being launched.</p>\n<p>“The i&gt;clicker program ran into a little bit of a hiccup getting the website up because we were kind of busy with the whole server side of things,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said that if the issues continue, the office will need a backup plan to finish its program implementation efforts.</p>\n<p>“So if we’re not able to do an online rental kind of reservation thing, we’re going to have to either come up with some plan B or maybe ask for permission to allow us to do the website,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Villarreal updated the senate on the funding the Finance and Business Committee has provided to student groups this past academic year. According to Villarreal, A.S. has granted $419,497 to 253 campus groups as of week seven of Winter quarter.</p>\n<p>“Whenever we’re questioned about how effective Associated Students is or how we help the students out, that’s how,” Villarreal said. “We provide over $400,000 worth of funding to groups so that they can put on their events, whether big or small, here or on the other side of the country, and they’re representing UCSB and making UCSB a better school.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Brooks has been featured on ”PBS News Hour” and “All Things Considered” on NPR and has written several best-selling books.</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, two sets of virtue exist: “résumé virtues,” which he characterizes as qualities people bring to their jobs, and “eulogy virtues,” which Brooks said are characteristics people value in a deceased person.</p>\n<p>“Most people today are clear on how to have a good career, but not really clear on how to have a good eulogy,” Brooks said.</p>\n<p>Brooks went on to say résumé virtues and eulogy virtues are in tension with each other, causing individuals who pursue good résumés to lose their ability to have a good eulogy.</p>\n<p>“[If you pursue résumé virtue] you turn into a shroud animal. You lack inner depth. You forget how to speak with a moral vocabulary. You live as an unconscious organism not really attached to the highest ideals, and you settle for a moral mediocrity,” Brooks said. “You’re not deserving of the eulogy you want, which only comes from an unfakeable virtue.”</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, people can overcome “moral mediocrity” by first confronting themselves and weighing their values on morals that he alleged have become less common in today’s culture.</p>\n<p>“To have that inner happiness, or even approach it, you have to step outside the ‘big me’ culture and you have to step back into a different moral collage, which used to be more common than now and which is based on a profound honesty about yourself,” Brooks said. “Character is built over the course of this confrontation with yourself.”</p>\n<p>Brooks also said stepping toward “inner happiness” comes from receiving help from others, rather than searching for self-help.</p>\n<p>“Character is not inside — no one is really strong enough to defeat selfishness or defeat self-obsession,” Brooks said. “We all need help from outside.”</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, pursuing virtue by self-confrontation and help from others makes it possible to escape the stresses and conflicts of a life of moral mediocrity.<br>\n“It is possible to go from scattered life to a really good life,” Brooks said.</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Leslie Medina said she was surprised that Brooks spoke on virtue, despite his reputation as a prominent political pundit.<br>\n“I feel like his talk was a little wishy-washy,” Medina said. “I wasn’t expecting what it came out to be.”</p>\n<p>Medina said she was glad she was able to attend Brooks’ lecture because he made profound points on the moral structure of modern culture.</p>\n<p>“I’m still glad I went because he had a lot of important things to say about society,” Medina said. “It left me with a lot to think about.”</p>\n<p>Second-year earth science major Ryan Kelleher said he particularly enjoyed when Brooks explored his characterization of eulogy virtue in today’s society.</p>\n<p>“I think he’s right in saying that people today just aren’t all that moral,” Kelleher said. “Virtue is something that everyone, especially college students, needs to keep in mind.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

The event was organized by UC Santa Barbara’s MultiCultural Center and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.law.columbia.edu/pt-br/news/2017/06/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality\">Q&amp;A interview with Columbia Law School last year</a>, Crenshaw defined intersectionality as follows:</p>\n<p>“Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.”</p>\n<p>A well-established scholar of critical race theory and law, Crenshaw spoke in front of a packed Campbell Hall audience.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply give a lecture to the audience, Crenshaw used a simulated dialogue between the late Martin Luther King Jr. and her colleague, renowned civil right activist and law expert, Barbara Arnwine.</p>\n<p>The imagined conversation gave life to Crenshaw’s intersectionality theory beyond what people have read or written on a page. Crenshaw told the audience the conversation was a reminder that although King strived for social justice, black women were not accounted for enough.</p>\n<p>Through Arnwine, she spoke about the way that prominent individuals like King and U.S. President Barack Obama upheld patriarchal beliefs.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major and black studies minor Nisa Smith said Crenshaw’s identity being similar to her own “made everything extra important” because she didn’t just talk about racism in a “one-dimensional” way.</p>\n<p>“People tend to only care about liberation as it pertains to them only. I feel like people are not always truly willing to do the work to eradicate their own privilege. Even if you are marginalized in your own way, you are also privileged in some way,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw discussed modern movements that have shed light on the role of black women in the U.S. #SayHerName is a movement created to bring awareness for black women who have lost their lives to police brutality and still have not been given justice.</p>\n<p>The words have been used in references to the killing of Sandra Bland, but before Bland’s name was even mentioned at Campbell Hall on Wednesday, a segment of Crenshaw’s dialogue asked audience members to hold their hands above their head if they recognized the names of victims of police brutality.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw first announced the names of black men such as Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and countless others associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, in which a majority of the audience’s hands remained up.</p>\n<p>However, once she listed the names of black women who are victims – Natasha McKenna, Michelle Cusseaux, India Beaty, Maya Hall and more – many started putting their hands down after the mentioning of just one name.</p>\n<p>As all hands in the lecture hall were no longer lifted, Crenshaw left a moment of silence intended to serve as a wakeup call showing the need for intersectionality and why it was created.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw’s perspective was not lost on the audience, including Smith, who said women should be given more recognition than they are currently given.</p>\n<p>“Black women are experiencing violence on the account of both their race and gender at minimum. These things shouldn’t have to be constantly said. People have to be bullied into giving recognition, attention and respect to black women,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Ingrid Banks, professor of black studies at UCSB, said she often uses Crenshaw’s work in her classes and lauded her influence in activism and academia.</p>\n<p>“One of Professor Crenshaw’s most important scholarly contributions is that she brilliantly argues that the limitations of anti-discriminatory theory beg for an intersectional approach in both Black Studies and Feminist Studies,” Banks said in an email.</p>\n<p>Banks said Crenshaw’s work is not “arrested” within academia and that her work often transcends into activism.</p>\n<p>“Her scholarly work finds legs in the activist efforts she makes on behalf of black girls and women. Both her scholarship and activism bleed intersectionality,” Banks said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story was printed on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/","id":2849,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[2848,2847,2846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Academic Senate Lifts 2014 Freeze on CCS Lit Admissions","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Academic Senate has lifted a 2014 admissions freeze placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2015.

This article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate has lifted a <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/academic-senate-approves-suspension-of-admissions-to-ccs-literature-major/\">2014 admissions freeze</a> placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Admission to the program was suspended on a temporary basis last year by the Undergraduate Council over concerns regarding program leadership, lack of adequate involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty and an underdeveloped relationship with other campus departments.  The Senate approved the decision to lift the freeze by the Undergraduate Council at a meeting last week on Feb. 12.  The suspension of admissions did not affect the degree trajectories of students already enrolled in the program.</p>\n<p>According to Undergraduate Council Executive Director Deborah Karoff, admission to the program was reinstated after the concerns leading to its suspension were addressed and resolved with efforts by multiple campus departments and faculty members.</p>\n<p>“The College of Creative Studies and several other departments on campus worked together to strengthen the involvement of Senate faculty in the program,” Karoff said.</p>\n<p>According to Karoff, it is a norm at the university that Senate-affiliated faculty participate in major programs of all the departments on campus. Karoff also said a number of individual Senate faculty and campus departments have made commitments to support the program in the future in a way sufficient enough to convince the Undergraduate Council to lift the freeze.</p>\n<p>Dean of CCS and professor of paleobiology Bruce Tiffney said the program suffered from lack of a “coherent curriculum” in place to develop foundational skills for literature students.</p>\n<p>“The program did not have a coherent curriculum put together that was allowing students to both clearly develop in their skills as both students of literature and of writing,” Tiffney said. “[The program] was not set up in a manner that would ensure that they would get out and be taking a range of courses outside and encountering these really wonderful faculty the campus has.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney said the decline of Senate-affiliated faculty over the years took place as part of a historical process of faculty engagement issues. He also mentioned that all other programs in CCS except literature have at least one Senate lecturer in their roster, which are faculty members in CCS and its equivalent academic department in the College of Letters and Science. According to Tiffney, a search is underway for a candidate to hold that dual position.</p>\n<p>“That individual will then be a core leader in the program … who has feet in both Letters and Science and CCS,” Tiffney said. “Now that this has been lifted, the is primary focus is to go and … can run a search.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney also said the CCS literature program historically has had a strong creative writing background in its instruction, but that other aspects of literary study were less prominent in the program. According to Tiffney, the program’s name may be changed to CCS Writing and Literature to reflect the greater breadth that comes with more faculty engagement as well as curricular changes. The curricular changes will reflect the increase of involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty as well as structural changes associated with the program’s foundational material.</p>\n<p>“In the past we did not have a set of courses that in essence built from the bottom up and developed a sense of knowledge from the campus of resources of expected areas of expertise,” Tiffney said. “What we are doing here — we did not have this before — would be a sequence of courses that would develop a background in literature … creative writing and then writing studies.”</p>\n<p>CCS literature instructor Angela Holzmeister said she is pleased the program will accept admissions for the coming academic year.</p>\n<p>“My experience teaching literature courses in CCS has been a tremendously gratifying one, due, not in the least, to the impressively intelligent students I’ve had the pleasure of working with this year,” Holzmeister said in an email. “These students are not only testimony to the quality of students admitted into CCS, but they are also the product of the education they receive at CCS.”</p>\n<p>The program will still undergo certain changes as it reopens for admissions, including unapproved curricular and name changes that will be considered at a March 12 meeting of the Academic Senate.</p>\n<p>CCS literature alumnus and current Community Manager of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Tony Pierce said he was pleased with the change in fortune for the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m super relieved that the university has realized that they have a hidden flower patch in CCS Lit that should just be left alone to bloom,” Pierce said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in a statement that he is thankful to the various faculty and administrative officials who helped oversee the program’s return.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that … Dean Bruce Tiffney and his administrative colleagues have overseen a successful proposal to revitalize CCS’s literature program,” Yang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/","id":2850,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2849,2848,2847],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
