Tuesday night in a candle-lit memorial titled “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends.”</p>\n<p>The third annual memorial walk organized by the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends” aimed to bring attention to victims of alcohol and drug abuse-related incidents, as well as to commemorate the victims of last May’s I.V. shooting. Due to rainy weather, memorial attendees walked through I.V. streets in coats, jackets and umbrellas.</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Education and Outreach Coordinator Marjan Riazi said the event was created in order to provide an opportunity for students to support each other through common experiences of loss.</p>\n<p>“This event is for students and community members who want to come together within a community of support to grieve and process their loss and experience,” Riazi said, “especially this year, as we additionally remember victims of the Isla Vista Tragedy.”</p>\n<p>The memorial walk also aimed to address the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse in I.V., specifically seeking to warn against “synergy,” or mixing alcohol with other drugs, which Riazi said is a persistent health issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Synergy, which has caused a number of deaths in Isla Vista, is prevalent within our community,” Riazi said. “It’s crucial for our students to be aware of the dangers of mixing alcohol and other drugs.”</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta said the memorial walk, along with other community-building efforts in I.V. and on campus, has played a significant role in helping to mend the I.V. and campus community in wake of recent unrest and tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We have taken this opportunity to just come together to remember students and community members we have lost,” Kurta said. “This year of course is especially powerful for all of us, we wanted to open this up to the larger community.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos for Recovery peer Nina Taylor said the walk had personal significance to her, as alcohol and drug issues are something that effect an extensive number of students on campus.</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m here is not only to support my community. This also touches base with some of the things I experience weekly with students that come and see us in our recovery program,” said Taylor. “I know a lot of people struggle and have had friends or family who have struggled with alcohol and drugs and as a result have injured themselves or lost their lives.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year anthropology major Brian Lee said the walk helped spur I.V. recovery from the May 23 tragedy and other common grievances experienced by students and I.V. residents last school year.</p>\n<p>“Ever since the shooting last year, it’s been really hard to recover as a community,” Lee said, “I thought tonight was a great way to just come together in peace and reminisce.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/","id":4802,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[4801,4800,4799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk","biography":"Not available","articles":[2782,2810,2859,4782,4802],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Das Williams Introduces I.V.

The bill was authored by Williams, who grew up in I.V., an unincorporated area with 20,000 residents situated on less than one square mile.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill would be building off previously passed legislation that established I.V. as a CSD over 30 years ago and would provide more specificity as to the structure and operation of I.V. as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“We would have to spell it out more than that previous legislation did,” Williams said. “I think that it is in the interests of the people of Isla Vista … as well as the state of California … that provides balance.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, when the legislature authorized the establishment of the Isla Vista College Community Services District (IVCCSD), the resulting proposal establishing I.V. as a CSD went before the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which did not approve the authorization.</p>\n<p>Williams said having the legislature act to establish a CSD would provide more flexibility than the LAFCO process.</p>\n<p>“State legislation, unlike the LAFCO process, provides great latitude in spelling out the specific powers of the community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said that if the bill passes, and is approved by the Senate and Governor Jerry Brown, a CSD could be established in I.V. with minimal input from LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“We could include some participation from LAFCO in the process,” Williams said. “However LAFCO is bound to only … approve or disprove a five member board that are all directly elected.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams’ office, the CSD would have the power to facilitate infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. The bill, however, does not specify how these community services will be funded, although Williams’ office has stated CSDs are commonly funded by revenue bonds or special taxes.</p>\n<p>Williams said the specifics of the CSD’s revenue will be determined through continued community dialogue.</p>\n<p>“There are many ideas for revenue, some are less controversial than others, and that is why we really need a stakeholder process to really talk about what is the right revenue sources for a community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thinks a CSD will be more successful than previous attempts at self-governance.</p>\n<p>“We as a community can make that change but we shouldn’t be so naive as to think that we can do it . . . with what we have because what we have had before is not working,” Williams said. “When we had a municipal advisory committee before it did not work. Governance by the county alone, without the resources to do things particularly for I.V., has not worked.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the university supporting the creation of self-governance in I.V. is a positive sign and a key difference to note when comparing previous attempts at self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“One thing that is really important that has changed since the previous attempts at local governance in I.V. is that the university, which was once an impediment to local governance in Isla Vista., is as an institution now arguing for local governance,” Williams said. “That is a change that everyone should have some hope in and it means that the aspirations of Isla Vista as a community may be able to be reached.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the establishment of some form of local governance must address the needs of the variety of residents in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Any local governance should provide a balance between the different residents of Isla Vista.,” Williams said. “Both what you could call the lower income ethnic communities of Isla Vista, the student population and the resident population concentrated out of the west end — there needs to be a balance between the interests of all of those parties.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, he and his staff will be asking for public comments from I.V. residents over the next two months to determine the specifics of the bill and said it is his “intention to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place.”</p>\n<p>“We will be asking for input as to what powers will be included in this community services district and how many seats there are, what their terms are, that sort of thing,” Williams said. “The legislation … would continue how it is with the added detail that can only happen after we receive more comprehensive and more specific public comment.”</p>\n<p>Williams said that given the events that have occurred in I.V. in the last year, the time to act is now.</p>\n<p>“There is plenty of time for further public input and for the stakeholder process,” Williams said. “But that given, the amount of human pain that has been experienced in Isla Vista in the last year, I felt that action was necessary and that we needed to begin this process and begin it now.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The meeting was hosted by Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams, who on Monday introduced a bill to the California State Assembly seeking to establish I.V. as a CSD through the legislature, rather than through Santa Barbara’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), the county entity responsible for overseeing changes to county and municipal governments.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, an elected body governing I.V. as an incorporated city could potentially alienate long-term residents who are not students.</p>\n<p>“If I could wave a magic wand, I would be for Isla Vista becoming a full-fledged municipal government with the powers and resources of a full-fledged municipal government,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“However, I think the flaws of it is that the question of how long-term residents would effectively continue to have a political voice in a demographic where the population became a larger population of students over the years, that was never really effectively answered.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he does not currently support cityhood for I.V. because it would not be possible to provide the variety of I.V. residents with appropriate political representation.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not possible politically because of that basic question of, how do you balance representation to represent all of the Isla Vista community?” Williams said. “How do you represent the 7,000 … people who live here longer than four years at a time when the vast majority live here for a shorter duration?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59083\" style=\"width: 431px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59083\" data-attachment-id=\"59083\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/iv-self-governance-forum/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Self-Governance-forum-by-Alex-Nagase_for-12.04.2014-1-of-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1100&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1100\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Assemblyman Das Williams speaks in the Isla Vista self-governance forum.

You can do almost everything except land use policy.”</p>\n<p>Another potential policy that was discussed at the meeting was the implementation of a UUT — a form of tax levied on the consumption of utilities services, such as water, telephone and gas — specifically to raise revenues to fund additional services for I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, an alumnus and local business owner, a utilities tax could provide the funds for better services for I.V. residents to the tune of roughly three million dollars.<br>\nFreeman said he suggests further research be conducted as to the effects a UUT would have on I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“That kind of balances the books with what we would be trying to do with a city,” Freeman said. “I’m really interested in the idea of maybe trying to construct a new financial study that instead of just looking at what we have looks at what we have combined with what we do.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr was skeptical about the logistics of implementing taxes in I.V. if it remains unincorporated as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to carve out one part of the unincorporated area for something to apply to,” Farr said. “The Board of Supervisors could look at trying to put a UUT on the ballot but it would have to apply to county-wide in all of the unincorporated areas.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said the student body is not satisfied with the status quo regarding I.V. and would support the establishment of a stronger form of local government.</p>\n<p>“I think students are really on board with this movement,” Guthy said. “We’ve been having these conversations in summer and I think there were questions before about do we like the status quo? In the conversations I’ve just been having, speaking from a student perspective, is ‘No.’”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students feel the current level of safety in I.V. is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>“Students feel unsafe walking just to their homes at night, you know, just walking from the library and that sense of insecurity in our own community is problematic,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>No decisions about the most suitable form of self-government were made at the meeting. However, it was stated that more roundtable meetings and public forums will be held at times and locations yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59080\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59080\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/","id":4800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4799,4798,4797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Committee Meets Over I.V.

CSD to provide infrastructure and services to I.V. residents. Students, I.V. residents and community members and stakeholders attended the meeting to voice their opinion on the importance of AB 3 and push for LAFCO’s support of the bill. LAFCO assigned commissioners Doreen Farr, Greg Geyer and Jeff Moorhouse to work with Williams on the bill and report to LAFCO on the progress being made.</p>\n<p>Williams said he believes LAFCO should play a role in the process of getting AB 3 passed, in addition to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>“I think the beginning is right now. I have asked for meetings with a number of individual board members and I would ask for meetings with all of them,” Williams said. “But in addition to individual meetings I would think LAFCO with your staff and board members should be a part of our stakeholder process.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the formation of a CSD in I.V. would assist the Board of Supervisors in the work they are doing to improve I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would say CSD could speed up the great work that board member Farr and others on the Board of Supervisors have done to provide safety lighting in Isla Vista, which is an integral part of the sexual assault issue out in Isla Vista,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>District Six Representative on the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees Jonathan Abboud said I.V. needs self-governance because its dense population makes it unlike other unincorporated areas.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a very unique place with probably one of the most dense communities on this side of the Mississippi and this CSD doesn’t go through the traditional LAFCO process because it is custom-tailored for Isla Vista,” Abboud said. “There are very specific things that are different for Isla Vista that don’t apply to a general unincorporated area. We waited for 40 years. Do we need to wait for another tragedy to get things going?”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the CSD would also help address the issue of insufficient law enforcement in I.V. in relation to a recent increase in population.</p>\n<p>“The second possibility would be to address the fact that while the population of Isla Vista has risen 25 percent, the amount of boots on the ground of law forcing officers has remained … relatively constant,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Thirty-year I.V. resident Thomas Dixon spoke at the meeting and said he supported AB 3 because he does not approve of manner which I.V. is currently governed.</p>\n<p>“The whole country is aware of Isla Vista being a problem community. [Isla Vistans] should have the power to at least control some of that,” Dixon said. “If you just obstruct the community service district and don’t come up with something better you’re just kicking the can down the road. We can’t just simply live with the status quo, that simply is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the CSD could also play a role in providing structure and control in the midst of the I.V. party culture, by modeling tactics used at other public universities.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly, which had a huge public safety issue around partying in their community, addressed it by hiring some students to be the face of Public Safety to address parties that were getting out of control,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said the role of the university in the establishment of self-governance in I.V. has taken a positive turn.</p>\n<p>“The role of the university — that is the one thing that changed and I view as an opportunity,” Williams said. “I have been very critical in the past, as have many residents … and the fact is that this process, this trustee report, is a huge change on the part of the attitude of the university — a willingness to say ‘We’re a part of the problem, we’re also a part of the solution’ and an opportunity that we have not had in 40 years, and I ask that we try to seize upon that opportunity.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/","id":4801,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4800,4799,4798],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
