The loss stopped a four-game winning streak the ‘Chos held against USC.</p>\n<p>In that match-up, USC busted out 15 hits and hurt starter Ben Brecht early. With one out in the third, the lefty southpaw was already relieved of duty after allowing five hits and two earned runs.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, on the other side, USC’s John Beller finished his day tossing 6.0 innings, giving up five hits and two runs, while striking out four in just his first collegiate start for the men of Troy.</p>\n<p>One of the bright spots on the day was junior shortstop Clay Fisher who banged out two hits on the day and brought in two RBI’s courtesy of his first and only home run of the season.</p>\n<p>Now, two weeks later, the storylines are completely different.</p>\n<p>At that point in the season, UCSB went into that game one match below .500. This time they are one game above it. In general, Santa Barbara has also won five of its last seven since its last meeting with USC.</p>\n<p>And, despite dropping two of three to Irvine this past weekend, UCSB still showed vital signs of a strong team earning its first road win of the season with a 16-hit, nine-run performance in its win on Saturday.</p>\n<p>A midweek win against USC on Tuesday would go a long way to showing how resilient this team is.</p>\n<p>However, in order to do that, it will need strong contributions from players like Fisher. On the season, the La Quinta native is currently slashing .271/.317/.383 and, more importantly, is back on the field defensively as he made his first appearances on the season at second base this past weekend.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it will try to get center fielder Tommy Jew back on track as before his 0-3 outing against UC Irvine on Sunday, the sophomore was riding a four-game hitting streak and went 6-17 with three RBI’s and three doubles.</p>\n<p>These two along with others will try to carry an offense that, through eight games so far in April, has stayed hot with a .275/.370/.416 slash line with six home runs.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also need a strong outing from Brecht. In his last outing against LMU in last week’s midweek match-up, the Wilmette native put up a much more valiant effort allowing seven hits and two earned runs while striking out three to earn the win.</p>\n<p>Brecht will need to put together a strong performance as he faces someone like freshman infielder Ben Ramirez who has gone 8-20 with seven RBI’s in his last five outings. The last time he played UCSB, he went 1-4.</p>\n<p>Guys like Chase Bushor and Kaleb Murphy will also be a handful as the junior and redshirt sophomore are both batting over .300 with 10 and two RBI’s respectively. Junior infielder Dillion Paulson leads the team in RBI’s with 23 and is currently batting .248 at the plate. He went 1-3 with two RBI’s against the Gauchos last time out.</p>\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, this game won’t mean much as the ‘Chos season continues onward. Santa Barbara needs to win the regular season conference title to make the postseason and defeating USC does not change that.</p>\n<p>However, there is something to be said for momentum. And after earning its first road win of the season this past weekend, it would be safe to assume the Gauchos would like to earn their second before heading back into conference play, on the road, against UC Davis beginning this Friday.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on USC at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, April 17th at Dedeaux Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Redshirt junior Clay Fisher brought him in later with a sac fly. Today was also a special day for Fisher as he started at second base, the first time he has seen field action all season since recovering from surgery on his right, throwing should last year.</p>\n<p>Junior Sam Cohen then lined a two-run single in the top of the fourth to extend the Gauchos lead to 3-0. In the bottom of the fourth, UC Irvine retaliated with one run to cut the lead down to two.</p>\n<p>Sophomore right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln was also very solid from the mound all the way through. On the day, Lincoln had another great start allowing just four hits and one earned run in 5.2 innings with three strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Lincoln was relieved of duty after allowing two singles in the bottom of the sixth. Junior Kevin Chandler came in out of the bullpen and saved the inning striking out the very next batter to keep the Gauchos lead at 3-1.</p>\n<p>During its half of the seventh inning, UCSB sent 12 batters to the plate scoring six runs against three Irvine pitchers to really take control of the match at 9-1.</p>\n<p>The rally included a leadoff double by sophomore center fielder Tommy Jew, a run-scoring double by freshman infielder Marcos Castanon, a two-run double by Williams and a pair of bases-loaded walks by UC Irvine’s Alonzo Garcia, the third pitcher of the inning.</p>\n<p>Irvine would go on to score one run in the seventh, eighth and ninth, but at the end of the day that would not be enough as UCSB escaped with the 9-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Over the final 3.1 innings, Chandler, freshman Chris Troye and junior transfer Alex Patterson allowed one run each, a pretty good outing from the pen following a solid start from Lincoln who picked up his second straight win to improve to 2-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>At the plate, Williams had his best day as a Gaucho but guys like freshman third baseman McClain O’Conner and Cohen also had solid days tallying multiple-hits.</p>\n<p>Another important key thing to note is that Saturday’s win is the Gauchos first road win of the season, a sign that maybe this team is starting to really turn the corner. Of course, that can’t be known until it possibly earns its fourth straight weekend series victory.</p>\n<p>The UCSB/UCI series will conclude with the rubber match beginning at 1 p.m. on Sunday, April 15 at Cicerone Field. The game will also be live streamed on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Kenny Corey. With two on, Keston Hiura hit a laser shot into the right-center gap that would roll to the wall.</p>\n<p>Hiura would bat in two runs on the stand-up triple. The Anteater DH continued to show why he should be the most feared hitter in the Big West by going 2 for 3 on the day with three RBI. Hiura’s Big West best batting average would improve to .405.</p>\n<p>Kyle Nelson, the starter for the Gauchos Saturday, recovered well after giving up the triple to Hiura. He would lock back in and pitch three scoreless innings for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Nelson, who gave up three home runs in his last start, pitched fantastic this time around, going six innings and giving up only one earned run while striking out five.</p>\n<p>Gaucho bats picked up right where they left off from game one and continued to tee off on Anteater pitching. After scoring two runs in the 4th, UCSB would plate five more runs in the 6th. Per usual, the Gauchos would cash in on one big inning: on five hits, five runs would score.</p>\n<p>Louis Raymond, the Irvine starter, in 5.2 innings gave up five earned runs on nine hits to the Chos.</p>\n<p>Armani Smith, Tommy Jew, and Kenny Corey had the best day at the plate for the Chos. Smith went 2 for 5 with a double while touching home twice for UCSB. Jew would also have a multi-hit game, going 2 for 4 on top of cashing in a run with a knock up the middle in the 6th.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho 3rd baseman Corey hit a ball past the diving shortstop Mikey Duarte in the 4th to score the first two runs for the Chos. Corey, who was 1 for 3, was also a centerpiece in a big play for UCSB.</p>\n<p>In the 6th, Corey would lay down a sacrifice bunt down in front of home plate. Anteater catcher Alex Guenette would airmail the throw to first and allow Armani Smith to score while Corey hustled around the bases eventually making it to 3rd on the throwing error.</p>\n<p>With all that run support and a more than solid outing from their starter Nelson, the Gauchos bullpen would dampen a beautiful day at the yard by giving up a five-run lead.</p>\n<p>Kevin Chandler would first come in to relieve Nelson in the 7th. Chandler would have control issues walking one batter and leaving the ball up to three more allowing three hits which would score 2 runs for Irvine.</p>\n<p>Next, Steven Ledesma would come in to relieve Chandler in the 7th. With two outs, Ledesma got the job done and limited the damage by striking out Alex Guenette.</p>\n<p>The very next inning though, Ledesma could only get one out. After an Adrian Damla single and a Dailin Lee walk, Ryan Johnston would hit a ball to Gaucho shortstop JJ Muno.</p>\n<p>The ball would hit off Muno’s glove and roll into left field scoring Damla. After the error, Head Coach Andrew Checketts would remove Ledesma and bring in freshman Chris Lincoln.</p>\n<p>A few batters later, Mikey Duarte, the Irvine shortstop, would single to right-center scoring Lee. Both runs would not be charged to Ledesma, but regardless the damage was done.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who at one point lead the game by a score of 7 to 2, headed to the top of the 9th barely hanging to a score of 7 to 6.  Chris Lincoln would come out to try to get the final 3 outs for the Chos.</p>\n<p>Lincoln would start off the inning by hitting the Irvine pinch hitter Matt Reitano with a fastball on a 3-2 count. Next, Anteater 2nd baseman Cole Kreuter would single through the left side.</p>\n<p>After a poor bunt by Adrian Damla that would move the runner to 3rd, but get the runner out at 2nd, Dallin Lee would hit a ball to the Gaucho shortstop JJ Muno. Muno trying to end the game on a double play threw the ball out of the reach for the second baseman Colton Burns.</p>\n<p>The ball would roll to the right field corner, scoring one run for the Anteaters. With this error from Muno, UC Irvine completed the 5 run comeback in the 9th.</p>\n<p>Runners on the corners after the error from Muno, Devin Pettengill hit a ball deep enough to left to score Adrian Damla on a sacrifice fly. From this, Anteaters took the lead 8 to 7.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the 9th, the Gauchos would not do much after a Colton Burns single to lead off the inning and a Billy Fredrick sacrifice bunt.</p>\n<p>Austin Bush would fly out to left field and for the final out Armani Smith would strike out swinging.  UC Irvine closer Calvin Faucher would record his Big West-leading 9th save of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think when you’re up 7 to 2, you should be able to overcome that with pitching. In my mind, we should overcome those. If we turn that double play with JJ (Muno) I think we might still be playing. It might be still a tie game. But again, I don’t think we did well out of the bullpen.” Coach Checketts continued, “I don’t want to throw any kids under the bus, you know, (the coaching staff and I) are responsible for it. We got to figure out who to throw out there in those situations.”</p>\n<p>So far this year, the Gauchos have had a rubber match game in each one of their conference series but the team has been unable to win one. Let’s see what Saturday has in store for both of these teams trying to turn around their season.</p>\n<p>Saturday, the Gauchos will take on the Anteaters for yet another rubber match conference game at 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 15th at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/","id":4124,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

They consistently executed at the plate despite the Gauchos pitching staff often getting ahead of them with two strikes, giving SDSU a total of 14 hits to the Gauchos mere six on the day.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>All three runs scored by UCSB were unearned, handed to them by defensive errors from the Aztecs. The Gauchos were hitting the ball hard at some points, but their offense struggled as they failed to direct those hard hit balls between the gaps and continued to leave their men stranded on base by the end of the inning on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing one run early in the second, UCSB starting RHP Noah Davis (6-3, 4.57 ERA) was dominant across seven and one-third frames, recording five of his six strikeouts in the second and third innings alone.</p>\n<p>But in the fifth, Davis gave up two consecutive RBI singles from sophomore first baseman Jordan Verdon and junior left fielder Tyler Adkison to score second baseman junior Alan Trejo and third baseman senior Andrew Brown, making the score 3-0 SDSU.</p>\n<p>In reference to the previous statement about SDSU having a scary talented offense that may or may not haunt the dreams of the pitchers who prepare to face them, the batting averages of these four Aztecs, in the order mentioned previously, are .329, .393, .329, and .322 on the season so far.</p>\n<p>UCSB, on the other hand, was graciously given opportunities to score on errors, just after SDSU had them scoreless with a three-run deficit thanks to their bats.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior catcher Dempsey Grover put down a solid bunt toward third base in the bottom of the fifth, which caused SDSU pitcher Marcus Reyes to scramble in a hurry to get the ball to first for an overthrow that advanced Grover to second. An additional panicked overthrow following Reyes’ from Aztecs junior right fielder Chase Calabuig then advanced the Gauchos redshirt junior all the way home to finally put UCSB on the board.</p>\n<p>Davis then retired SDSU over four at-bats in the top of the sixth, and the Gauchos plated two more runs in the bottom of that inning to even the playing field once again at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The second Gaucho scored was Billy Fredrick, who was knocked in on a RBI single from center fielder Tommy Jew. But Fredrick himself got on base due to a fielding error from Trejo, so his run was deemed unearned.</p>\n<p>Then, because baseball has its way with being weird, Jew left to steal second in a runners-on-first-and-third scenario with two outs in the bottom of the sixth, and when SDSU catcher Dean Nevarez stood up in his attempt to throw Jew out at second, he hit his own pitcher, Reyes, square in the right cheek of his buttocks (some may argue left cheek to trigger debate) instead. This humorous error deflected the ball toward right field, easily allowing sophomore DH Sam Cohen, who was standing on third, to make his way home.</p>\n<p>From here, the score remained tied up at 3-3 until the top of the ninth, in which Trejo took a leadoff strikeout much to his disappointment, causing him to be ejected by the home plate umpire.</p>\n<p>Although this could have critically affected SDSU in a crucial tiebreaker situation, Trejo’s ejection did not deter them from putting up two more before the Gauchos final word.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs were able to take back the lead with a RBI single up the middle off of UCSB RHP Kevin Chandler (0-1, 5.74 ERA) from Verdon to score Brown, and a sac-fly from Calabuig off of Chandler’s replacement, LHP Steven Ledesma (1-3, 7.99 ERA), to score senior shortstop Danny Sheehan.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior JJ Muno, who is now the teams’ shortstop after the injury to key player Clay Fisher, began the bottom of the ninth with a single to right field to hopefully spark a UCSB comeback. Unfortunately, though, he stood there for the duration of three consecutive fly-outs from Grover, Colton Burns, and Billy Fredrick to officially end the game 5-3, crushing any hopes of heading into tie-breaking extras.</p>\n<p>It was a tough game for the ‘Chos as for the first time in their last eight games, they were held under six runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense should take the evening to recuperate because they will be back tomorrow facing off against the Aztec’s authoritative lefty Dominic Purpura who is a perfect 6-0 on the year with a 2.85 ERA.</p>\n<p>This kind of intimidation might positively motivate UCSB to improve its mindset at the plate and smack some runs in early in the likely case that the Aztecs have an offensive explosion. In the case of SDSU, some early fielding practice might go a long way for them in this series.</p>\n<p>Game two between the Gauchos and the Aztecs takes place at 2 p.m. tomorrow at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77246\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-21/ucsb-loses-game-one-against-sdsu-5-3/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77246\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-21/ucsb-loses-game-one-against-sdsu-5-3/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-21/ucsb-loses-game-one-against-sdsu-5-3/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-21/ucsb-loses-game-one-against-sdsu-5-3/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-21/ucsb-loses-game-one-against-sdsu-5-3/","id":4125,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4124,4123,4122],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
