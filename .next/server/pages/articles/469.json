It seemed like the UCSB women’s basketball team had everything fall into place for the first time this season, holding a nine point lead with 4:32 remaining against UC Davis. However, a 12-0 run by the Aggies help send the game into overtime where they went on to defeat the Gauchos 60-54.</p>\n<p>With another loss to UC Irvine just two days earlier, UCSB now falls to 0-20 for the year and 0-7 in conference play. Both the Anteaters and the Aggies fell to Cal Poly over the weekend, but Irvine was able to pick up its first conference win of the year to move to 4-18 overall, 1-6 Big West. Davis is now 9-10 overall, 4-3 Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy at their age to want to throw the towel in,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We may be the only 16 people in here that believe that it’s going to get turned around, but all you can do is keep jabbing away.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although UCSB has played its best prolonged stretch of basketball over the past three games, it has faltered down the stretch of each of them. This was on display most against Davis, when the Gauchos did something they hadn’t done all year by taking a sizable lead into the final minutes.</p>\n<p>After a pair of free-throws by sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe gave UCSB a 45-36 lead with 4:32 to go, the Aggies took control. Two three-pointers by Kelsey Harris helped cut the lead to one before a layup by Celia Marfone with 1:48 remaining gave Davis its first lead since very early in the first half.</p>\n<p>“They changed up their defense,” Mitchell said. “We had a decent rhythm going up against their 3-2. They went to a half-court trap and we had a couple of turnovers against it that made us lose our rhythm.”</p>\n<p>Trailing by three in the final seconds of regulation, the Gauchos looked to free up freshman guard Makala Roper. After being unable to find anywhere to go with the ball, Jemerigbe took the game into her own hands, stepping back to fire a deep three, her only attempt of the game, which miraculously went in to tie it at 48-48 and send the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>“I knew we needed a three,” Jemerigbe said. “The confidence that the team had in me willed me to make it. I just got out there and knocked it down with confidence.”</p>\n<p>With all the momentum on its side, UCSB was unable to outplay the Aggies in the back-and-forth extra session. A three-point play by Jemerigbe and a three-pointer from Roper helped keep the game close at 54-56, but the Gauchos went 0-3 from the field with two turnovers in the final 48 seconds as they fell, 60-54.</p>\n<p>Harris led the way for Davis with 19 points on 5-10 from downtown, while Jemerigbe put in a team-high 14 points to go along with six assists. Jemerigbe leads the Big West with 5.6 assists per game during conference play.</p>\n<p>The game also marked the first time in Mitchell’s four years as head coach that the Gauchos have gone to overtime.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s game against Irvine similarly went down to the wire, as UCSB overcame a 10-point second half deficit to cut the lead to one. A jumper by senior center Clair Watkins made it 39-38 with just over a quarter of the game remaining. However, that was the closest Santa Barbara would get.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Jasmine Ware put in a career-high 21 points on 10-19 shooting, but it wasn’t enough as the Anteaters converted from the line down the stretch, eventually winning 61-58.</p>\n<p>After another winless weekend, Mitchell had one message to give to her team.</p>\n<p>“Do not give up,” Mitchell said. “March Madness, last time I heard you win 3 or 4 or 5 in a row and you’re dancing so we’ll keep that mindset.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will head on the road this weekend for a single game against Hawaii on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Aggies find themselves in a three-way tie for fourth place at 8-9 overall, 3-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to go in with the same mindset as any other game,” freshman guard Makala Roper said. “We’re just gonna play our game, move the ball offensively, get after it defensively and hope we get the win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While the season hasn’t gone as planned for these two teams, there is one thing we know about tonight’s matchup between the Gauchos and the Anteaters: someone is going to get their first conference win of the new year.</p>\n<p>The most recent results may favor UCSB, as it has competed at a much higher level in its last two games. Against UC Riverside last Thursday, led by Roper and her career-best 23 points, the Gauchos put up 74 points on 54.5 percent shooting, both season highs, but failed to overcome a significant rebound and free-throw disparity.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we’ve looked to get some more movement with high posts and reversing the ball a lot,” Roper said. “That’s created a lot of open jumpshots and we’ve been able to knock them down.”</p>\n<p>Two days later, Santa Barbara found itself with the lead with just under 5:30 remaining against Cal State Fullerton, but fell just short, losing 54-50. The two losses may not be something to brag about, but they have shown definite signs of improvement for a team that has ranked last in the conference in a number of statistical categories for the majority of the season.</p>\n<p>“It was nice that we were capable of putting up 74 against an athletic team like Riverside and it was probably just as refreshing to see us come back and get after it on the defensive end against Fullerton,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think we’re making progress in seeing that from game-to-game we may have to play a different tempo and style and try to find different ways to win as we come down the stretch.”</p>\n<p>Roper has been UCSB’s top outside threat all year, accounting for over 60 percent of the team’s three-pointers on the year. Her 7.9 points per game is the second highest on the team, behind only sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe, who averages team-highs of 8.3 points and four assists per game.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kristine Brance has also been a big part of the Gauchos’ improved play. In the last two games, Brance has gone 10-16 from the field, including 4-7 from downtown, as she led the team in scoring on the two-game road trip.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters bring to town the only offense in the conference which shoots a lower three-point percentage than the Gauchos, a category which UCSB ranks last in defensively by a mile. This may give the Gauchos the upper hand, as they would have enjoyed a number of wins so far this year if not for their inability to stop the three-ball.</p>\n<p>“Irvine’s extremely talented athletically. I know they lost their go-to player Camille Buckley last year, so maybe they haven’t found the rhythm of their team either,” Mitchell said. “But I don’t think it’s a cakewalk at all. Irvine is just as talented as a lot of teams in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s matchup against UC Davis will be a completely different story. The Aggies rank No. 1 in three-point shooting in the Big West, knocking down 39.2 percent from long-range. They are led by the conference’s top outside shooter in senior guard Kelsey Harris, who shoots an incredible 48.4 percent on threes.</p>\n<p>Leading Davis’s offensive charge is senior forward Sydnee Fipps, who ranks third in scoring at 15.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Davis is blue collar. We know all five players on the court can shoot from the three-point line and we’ll just have to bring our A-game on the defensive end of it,” Mitchell said. “We’ll probably have to play a small lineup and make a lot of switches, and we’ll need discipline from tip-off to final buzzer.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s game against Irvine is set to tip-off at 7:00 p.m. and will be played on Teacher Appreciation/Superhero Night. Saturday’s matchup with Davis will begin at 2:00 p.m. Both games will be held in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/gauchos-return-home-for-battle-of-winless-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/gauchos-return-home-for-battle-of-winless-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/gauchos-return-home-for-battle-of-winless-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/gauchos-return-home-for-battle-of-winless-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/gauchos-return-home-for-battle-of-winless-teams/","id":466,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[465,464,463],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose Seventh Straight Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Losing 47-64, the Gauchos took a blow to the ego as well as its now 3-19 overall record.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another disappointing loss at UC Irvine pushes the UCSB men’s basketball team losing streak to seven.

Unfortunately, the Gauchos were experiencing the same problem they have had all season: getting the ball into the basket. The team was able to get off 10 shots in 10 minutes but only completed two of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starters sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak and freshman guard Christian Terrell each had a tough first half, both going 0-3 on shooting and each getting called personal fouls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When playing the No. 2 team in the conference away and without some of their best players, the Gauchos really needed to bring a new level of play to the court, but they could not quite pull it off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the first half went on, scoring on both sides of the court slowed as the teams subbed around, both trying to find a good rhythm. The first period ended after a layup from Gaucho senior guard Eric Childress immediately followed by an Anteater three-pointer by senior center Ioannis Dimakopoulos. With Gauchos down 18-27, things were not looking bright.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first 30 seconds of the second half, UCSB junior forward Alex Hart made a layup, just one of his seven baskets during this game. This half the Gauchos needed to figure out how to start getting points on the board, and Hart absolutely made that happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After only scoring two free-throws in the first half, Hart had a perfect game, making every shot he took in the second half and adding 14 to the Gauchos’ score. In 13 minutes of playing time during the second half, he made the biggest impact for UCSB by far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hart was able to score a career-high of 16 total points, one player was no match for the Anteaters. The Gauchos only allowed four more points to be score in the first 15 minutes of the second period, but they were not scoring any at all.</span></p>\n<p>By the middle of the second half, Irvine had established a solid nine-point lead that the Gauchos were having serious trouble breaking. It was not until the 11th minute that Santa Barbara clearly had no steam left.

The Matadors have now won the season series over UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was simply outhustled. Outrebounded 53-36, UCSB had no answer for the Matadors’ sophomore center Channon Fluker, who notched 17 points and tied her career-high of 20 rebounds. Fluker’s 14 defensive rebounds are the second most in a single-game in CSUN’s Division I history.</p>\n<p>“The discipline for us right now, and the fight for us has just been gut wrenching for all of us,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “If we can’t knock down the three, which we hven’t for three games, somebody’s got to put it on the floor and get to the rim, and get fouled. We missed 18 layups. We got too many [girls] that just played the three-point line.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

It’s the fourth time in five games that the Gauchos have shot below 30 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Now on a two-game losing streak, the Gauchos fall to fourth in the Big West standings at 11-12, 6-4. Just one conference win away from tying UCSB, CSUN won its fourth-straight to improve to 12-11 and 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was an undisciplined start for UCSB’s offense in the opening minutes of Thursday’s game as the Gauchos had three turnovers in their first five possessions.</p>\n<p>While UCSB dealt with miscues, CSUN gradually established a rhythm that led to its 7-0 run and lead.</p>\n<p>Beginning with sophomore center Channon Fluker and ending with a three-point make by junior guard Serafina Maulpe, the Matadors seemed to be on their way to repeating their 48 percent shooting percentage in the first meeting.</p>\n<p>Maulupe finished with a game-high 22 points, 17 of which she scored in the first half.</p>\n<p>Yet, halting CSUN’s run was the subbing in of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler at the 6:32 mark as she served as the catalyst to the Gauchos’ 8-0 run. She scored a team-high 12 points, a game-high six assists, and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>The string of points began with Toler grabbing a defensive rebound, then driving coast-to-coast for the foul and score before converting at the free-throw line to score the team’s first field goal of the game. A made layup freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez gave UCSB its first lead of the game of 12-11.</p>\n<p>The Matadors regained their lead of 12-11 as a result of a made free-throw by Maulupe. With the shot clock off, CSUN ended the first period with a 14-11 lead after a spin and layup by freshman guard Hayley Tanabe.</p>\n<p>UCSB found itself on the downside of a run once again in the opening minutes of the second quarter as CSUN put together a 9-2 run, in which Maulupe scored seven points during the stretch. Scoring points both in the lane and from behind the perimeter, CSUN’s all-around scorer handed the Matadors their first double –figure lead of the game of 23-13.</p>\n<p>Despite inconsistencies from beyond the arc, UCSB had some peak moments along the perimeter. Knocking down some major deep shots were both Redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter and freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez with back-to-back three-pointers to decrease the team’s lead to four 23-19.</p>\n<p>Porter recorded 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting, 2-of-7 from long range. Hernandez nearly posted a similar outcome with eight points while finishing 3-of-9 and 2-of-7 from three-point land.</p>\n<p>Providing hustle off the bench was junior forward Taylor Farris, scoring UCSB’s final two field goals of the half with a baseline floater and jumper. In 16 minutes of play, Farris had six points and three rebounds on 3-of-8 shooting.</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos inched closer and closer to trimming their deficit, CSUN would respond each time.</p>\n<p>Quietly emerging for CSUN with a perfect 4-of-4, 2-of-2 three-point shooting performance was senior guard Emily Cole. It was her two made three-pointers in the final three minutes of the first half that curtailed UCSB’s momentum, as one of her deep range makes allowed the Matadors to enter halftime with a 33-25 lead.</p>\n<p>The exchange of baskets between both teams continued in the third quarter as CSUN maintained a lead of at least seven points for the entire period.</p>\n<p>After coming up empty-handed in its first two possessions of the second half, a drive and drawing of a foul by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe gave the Gauchos life despite her being unable to convert at the free-throw line as UCSB would trail 33-27. Jemerigbe tallied six points and three assists.</p>\n<p>Maulupe and Cole were the Matadors’ source of offense in the third, combining for nine points on 4-of-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Entering down nine points 46-37, the fourth quarter turned out to be the Gauchos most productive quarter as they honed in scoring the ball to amass a 10-3 run during the period.</p>\n<p>Their defense played a critical role in the stretch of points as they held CSUN to just one point in the first three and half minutes of the final period.</p>\n<p>The peak of UCSB’s run began with a three-point make by sophomore guard Coco Miller, who brought the Gauchos closer to Northridge’s lead 49-44. Miller concluded Thursday with seven points as her only two field goals in the game were from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Following Miller’s make was the Gauchos’ press defense which forced CSUN into a 30-second shot clock violation with 5:18 remaining in the game. Porter would then hit a three-pointer to bring UCSB within a two-point deficit of 49-47.</p>\n<p>Yet, overshadowing UCSB’s comeback effort was Fluker’s outburst of 13 fourth quarter points. In addition to going 3-for-6 from the field in the quarter, the star center was most proactive in earning 14 free-throw attempts, making half of them.</p>\n<p>A rebound and putback score by Fluker put CSUN up 51-47. UCSB continued to chase the Matadors’ lead but could never fully contain their hustle on the boards which led to various trips to the free-throw line and a loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begins its four-game road trip this Saturday, Jan. 11 at Hawaii at 7 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75644\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/gauchos-outhustled-by-csun-in-62-55-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75644\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/gauchos-outhustled-by-csun-in-62-55-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/gauchos-outhustled-by-csun-in-62-55-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/gauchos-outhustled-by-csun-in-62-55-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/gauchos-outhustled-by-csun-in-62-55-loss/","id":468,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[467,466,465],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
