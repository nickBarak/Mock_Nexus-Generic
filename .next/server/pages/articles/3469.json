The top five highest paid employees at UCSB, according to base pay as of 2012, are Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Dean of the College of Engineering Rod C. Alferness, Nobel Prize-winning physics professor David Gross, Nobel Prize Laureate and economics professor Finn Kydland and psychology professor Michael Gazzaniga.</p>\n<p>The top two highest paid females, also based on base pay as of 2012, are Professor and Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Academic Policy Maria Herrera-Sobek, listed as the 15th highest paid employee at UCSB, and Dean of the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education, Jane Close Conoley, listed as the 19th most paid. Of the top 40 highest paid employees listed, only five are female, and this includes Sobek, Conoley, mechanical engineering and computer science professor Linda Petzold, economics professor Shelly Lunderg, and psychological &amp; brain services professor and chair Diane Mackie.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>According to Sobek, in the midst of a discrepancy in pay between male and female employees, the university has developed programs to address some of the pipeline issues for faculty members and graduate students, such as more childcare, “Family friendly policies for faculty” and special organizations targeting women scientists such as Women in Science and Engineering, or WISE.</p>\n<p>“Compensation is actually determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, seniority and field of study,” Sobek said. “Historically, universities’ leadership and senior faculty were predominantly male. That has been changing over the past several decades as institutions have made concerted efforts to recruit and retain female faculty.”</p>\n<p>Despite these programs, Petzold, who has been a professor in the field of mechanical engineering and computer science at UCSB for the past 17 years and is one of the top five highest paid females on campus, said even though there is no “overt bias” at the university, there exists some “hidden biases in culture” generally.</p>\n<p>“Sheryl Sandburg — she’s famous for working for the tech giant Google and now Facebook. She’s the one who says ‘Lean in,’” Petzold said. “’Lean in. Be aggressive.’ But studies say that if you’re too aggressive, you’re seen as being a ‘bitch’. So there’s this fine line you have to negotiate and … there are some subtle biases.”</p>\n<p>Petzold also said the undergraduate population of women in computer science at UCSB is 10 percent, which is typical around country. According to her, the issue is not that women are not getting accepted into these majors, but rather that females are “not even applying.”</p>\n<p>“The problem precedes the university,” Petzold said. “It occurs earlier than that. Over the course of my career, I’ve talked to various groups of women and have seen that the earliest the outreach, the better.”</p>\n<p>According to feminist studies chair and professor Eileen Boris — who specializes in labor studies and women, work, and welfare — more women are in low wage jobs than men, and women dominate the fastest growing, lowest paid jobs in the country, which includes cafeteria and clerical workers. While that is not to say men do not occupy low wage jobs, nationally there are statistically more men who are in higher paid occupations, Boris said.</p>\n<p>“A recent study just done by economist Claudia Goldin that was published this month in the American Economics Review says that the pay gap between men and women widens in the highest paid positions, like medicine and business,” Boris said. “So there’s something else happening. It isn’t just that women are in the lower paying occupations … It’s also that the structure of work is not flexible, in terms of location and in terms of hours.”</p>\n<p>Boris said the university has to bring a critical lens not only to women’s ability to become professionals in fields such as the sciences, but also in the work conditions that form these environments.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t just having women become mechanical engineers, but also looking at what is the condition of work in labs,” Boris said. “Women do pretty well in the post-doc stage, but after that there comes a gender gap because the tenure clock and the baby clock hit each other.”</p>\n<p>While professors like Boris and economists like Goldin say the solution to bridging the gender pay gap is to change work structures nationwide, men’s rights proponents such as second-year political science major Jason Garshfield said this mentality does not take into account the “male side.”</p>\n<p>“If we give scholarships to women to enter STEM fields, we should give scholarships to men to enter the humanities. If we institute maternity leave, we should also institute paternity leave,” Garshfield said. “I also believe we should get rid of the Feminist Studies program, and replace it with a program that gives a fair hearing to the perspectives of both genders.”</p>\n<p>But according to Petzold’s account of her early career in mechanical engineering and computer science, she found it particularly difficult to compete in an “aggressive” and predominantly-male environment in which “men demand more” in comparison to women.</p>\n<p>“I can say that early in my career, it was hard,” Petzhold said. “I think women grow up are being taught not to be as aggressive, to be more polite and to be helpful. All those things are innately good traits, but are not dominant traits early in careers of science and engineering … which is why it’s important we encourage women to be in these positions.”</p>\n<p>At UCSB, 33 percent of faculty are women, and of those, 86 percent are tenured, according to Yang. Among the staff, 57 percent of professional and support staff are women and 44 percent of managers and senior professionals are women.</p>\n<p>“We are continuously striving to ensure that our Academic Personnel and Human Resources processes and practices are without any gender bias,” Yang said. “Gender equity in pay is absolutely a priority that we must practice every day.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, May 2, 2014 edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional.”<em> Breana Lepe / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional” or using alternative standardized tests beyond the ACT and the SAT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Standardized Testing Task Force’s (STTF) report comes on the heels of a brewing debate as to whether or not universities should amend their policies to either forgo requiring standardized testing results altogether or to make submitting them optional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, prominent UC administrators, including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive, supported the elimination of standardized testing after they deemed it a barrier for underserved students, the Los Angeles Times </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-23/uc-officials-recommend-dropping-sat-admission-requirement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point in time, the Academic Senate still supports the use of standardized testing, namely because it is unclear how altering the standardized testing policy will affect the admissions process as a whole, systemwide diversity and consistency among applicants, the task force said in its report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC — which receives the largest volume of SAT scores in the nation — were to alter its standardized testing requirements at this time, the report noted that “such a move could have significant, unanticipated, and undesirable effects” on students who plan to apply to a UC school in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the STTF report, the UC currently uses standardized tests for four purposes: to assess academic preparation and achievement, to use as markers for success beyond high school GPA, to establish eligibility and to aid in admitting students at individual campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But standardized testing is only one part of a 14-measure suite of admissions practices used by UC campuses, called a “comprehensive review,” according to the report. The “comprehensive review” encompasses students’ academics and backgrounds to factor in social disparities, the report said.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara and UC Riverside weigh students’ applications based on their standardized test scores before the “comprehensive review” stage. At UCSB, SAT and ACT scores comprise 20 to 25% of a students’ admission score, depending on major, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At all other UC campuses, however, applications enter the “comprehensive review” stage without a weight assigned to their standardized test scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test scores are still weighted less than high school grades, and “admissions decisions are ultimately made based on a review of all the information available in the applicant’s file.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the predictive power of test scores, or how accurately the tests reflect eligibility, has increased in the past decade, the report found, while the predictive power of high school grades has decreased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also said that current standardized testing procedures may be a possible contributor to the underrepresentation of different groups at UC campuses. Almost 60% of California high school graduates are underrepresented minorities (URM), but only 37% of California resident students admitted to a UC school in 2019 were URMs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also acknowledged that the UC’s admissions procedures do not fully compensate for students’ racial and socioeconomic disparities, but found that “for any SAT score, students from disadvantaged groups have a higher probability of being admitted than students from advantaged groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its recommendation to continue using standardized tests, the report also said the UC should steer clear of using the Smarter Balanced Assessment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consortium </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(SBAC) in lieu of the current standardized tests, such as the ACT or SAT. The SBAC, which 11th grade California students take in high school, is aligned to a different set of academic standards and carries risks that are either not present or not as extreme in the ACT or SAT, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The task force was deeply concerned with a wide range of risks related to the adoption of SBAC to meet UC admissions requirements, including (but not limited to) test security, item exposure control, and item bank size,” the report read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report will now move on to the UC’s entire Academic Senate for systemwide input. Then, the Academic Senate will forward its recommendation to UC President Janet Napolitano, who will make a recommendation to the UC Board of Regents to make a final decision in May. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The town hall is the third of four scheduled meetings, the next to be held on Feb. 4 at UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall began with an introduction from Regent Gareth Elliott, who explained that the purpose of the special committee is to consider candidates and recommend an individual to succeed President Napolitano.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan Brostrom, UC systemwide executive vice president and chief financial officer, initiated the public forum, urging the special committee to “nominate candidates who are deeply committed to the mission of social mobility in the Central Valley and in California.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brostrom said he hopes that this commitment to social mobility will “not just be in underrepresented communities or in socioeconomic status, but also in geography representing the Central Valley,” as well as assist the </span><a href=\"https://excel.ucmerced.edu/first-generation-stem-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of students at UC Merced (UCM) who are first-generation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with talking about the UC system as a whole, Brostrom focused specifically on the campus of Merced, urging the committee to look at candidates who understand how much UCM still relies on financial aid and administrative support from central UC offices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As many other speakers — comprised of staff and executive members employed at UCM — came to speak before the board, they expressed concerns over the campus’s financial needs and its capability to fund the needed educational growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In recent years, as UCM is on the rise and our students and faculty grow, staff hiring has not kept up,” Priya Lakireddy, president of UCM Staff Assembly, said. “Many of the staff are asked to do more and take on additional responsibilities without resources or compensation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cindi Zimmerman, campus risk manager at UCM, presented a similar financial concern. She discussed the growing pains UCM is experiencing as a young campus, such as “funding constraints [that] create roadblocks for additional full-time employees, which are desperately needed do to the work in order to support the faculty and staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from financial considerations, other UCM speakers encouraged the special committee to select a candidate that mirrors Napolitano’s drive and ambition to continue furthering the academic successes of the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope you will consider President Napolitano’s passion and determination as baseline qualities when choosing candidates to succeed her,” Chris Abrescy, executive director of Alumni Relations, said. “At UCM, we need a president who will understand the Central Valley and its desperate needs for teaching, research and public service that uplifts this economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next President should consider how, in the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/us/university-california-merced-latino-students.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">words of New

spokesperson, the new guidelines are effective immediately. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; outsourcing has been a point of contention between the UC and its unions in the past. In May 2019, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, the UC’s largest union, went on a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/afscme-announces-strike-over-outsourcing-unfair-labor-practices/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one-day strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over outsourcing concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the new guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new guidelines build upon the original UC Regents motion from November and hinge on the practice of insourcing, which is when “[outside] service contracts are terminated or not renewed, and the work is transferred to UC employees,” according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered services — contracted labor typically performed by union employees — are at the center of the new guidelines. According to the guidelines, the UC hopes to insource “to the fullest extent possible” moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To determine if a covered service is eligible for insourcing, the guidelines say the UC must consider “equipment needed to perform the service,” “technical skills or expertise required to perform the service” and the “law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the guidelines say the UC must notify AFSCME when a UC campus is ready “to transition contracted covered service work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the guidelines, only certain types of covered services can continue to be outsourced, namely when it is “required by law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC deems an outsourced covered service necessary, the guidelines mandate that UC employees cannot be displaced as a result and that “any proposed contract for Covered Services that would result in displacement must be canceled.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guidelines also explain how the UC will accommodate insourced covered service workers by providing them with the matching wages — $15 an hour or more — and benefits of university employees. According to the guidelines, the UC Systemwide Human Resources office will determine the wage and benefit parity on a yearly basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to covered service workers, the guidelines also explain how the UC should go about insourcing supplier employees, which are contractors employed by the UC to perform a specific type of work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To become insourced as a “UC career employee,” the guidelines say supplier employees must be eligible to work in the U.S., pass a background check and perform the same services at the same campus for 1,000 hours over a 12-month period or for “35% time over” a 36-month period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If AFSCME determines that a pending contract for covered services doesn’t comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the UC, the union has up to 14 calendar days to file a grievance with UCOP, according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, the guidelines say UCOP has 10 days to respond to the grievance; if UCOP denies the grievance, AFSCME can file an “appeal to arbitration” within 10 days of receiving UCOP’s response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of an appeal, the guidelines say that an arbitrator will determine whether or not the UC’s pending contract for the covered service is appropriate. If it is appropriate, the contract will remain in place; if it isn’t, the contract must be terminated and the university must “stop the contracting process,” the guidelines read. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
