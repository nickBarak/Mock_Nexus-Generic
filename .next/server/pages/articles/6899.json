After a three-and-a-half year hiatus between albums, the band’s new record has definitely been worth the wait: In its first week of sales, the album topped the charts in eight countries, surpassing the group’s previous album receptions.</p>\n<p>With an elegant combination of heart-wrenching soul and blood-pumping indie rock, Florence and the Machine has become a staple for the Alternative genre since the band’s breakout album “Lungs” in 2009. Florence’s mastery of conveying sorrow, triumph and everything in between is apparent in the band’s unconventional pairings of powerful vocals and striking lyrics along with graceful instrumental accompaniments. The group’s eccentric use of long instrumental breaks to begin or end their songs creates an otherworldly atmosphere, one that enraptures and envelops us seamlessly. Listening to any Florence and the Machine song will effortlessly take you to a different time, place or state of mind.</p>\n<p>Florence and the Machine’s unique and unforgettable sound has brought them much well-earned success: In just seven years, the band has received eight BRIT nominations, three Grammy nominations and ten MTV award nominations from Europe, America and Japan. They’ve won the BRIT’s Critics’ Choice Award (2009), BRIT’s Album of the Year (“Lungs,” 2010) and the MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction on their music video “Dog Days Are Over” (2010). But with nine pending nominations and their new record’s unprecedented rankings, the band’s success will undoubtedly continue to escalate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

“Lungs” reached Number 16 in 2009, while “Ceremonials” took Number 6 in 2011.</p>\n<p>While the previous records have a more hauntingly engulfing effect, “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful” is a celebratory cry, an aubade welcoming life’s possibilities with triumphant instrumentals and simply stunning vocals. With the group’s empowering sound and undeniably strong stage presence, Florence and the Machine’s performance will be one you won’t want to miss.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

One of the hottest tickets on this year’s lineup goes down this Friday when Ariel Pink and Black Lips bring the lo-fi heat to SOhO Restaurant and Music Club.</p>\n<p>Atlanta garage punk rockers Black Lips have a long history of raucous live shows. Their earlier acts were typified by an abundance of moshing and crowd surfing, which became tame when accompanied by the ample nudity, fire and bodily fluids on display. Tales of this wanton debauchery surround the group, even when they would rather let them lie as relics of a preliminary era. Yet, it’s hard to forget legends of guitars set ablaze, frontman Cole Alexander spitting up stews of blood, beer and vomit all over the stage and the band fleeing South Asia to avoid jail time for what Indian statutes deemed “homosexual acts,” (including Alexander making out with guitarist Ian St. Pé and the casual showcasing of their genitals).</p>\n<p>The band and its members embody the punk staple of rowdy spectacles as a central component of the musical act itself. Though their live act has seemed to cool off a bit as the band has become more talented musically over the years (i.e. they now actually know how to play instruments and thus have less to compensate for), concertgoers should still expect to get their fill of aggressive action. Though they might not be setting fireworks off on the stage these days, one should still consider the benefits of a poncho when planning on entering the ‘splash zone.’</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Los Angeles-based experimental pop multi-instrumentalist Ariel Pink will share the stage with the Lips next Friday. Born Ariel Marcus Rosenberg, Pink’s decade-long career began in a decidedly DIY place, eschewing ornament and clarity for a scratchy, anachronistic sound that he could hide behind, a sound not intended for performance. But like his supporting act, Pink has outgrown his lo-fi roots over time, transforming his earlier fare of heavy distortion and crackly vocals into a controlled-chaos pastiche of retro pop, electronica and psych-rock with the support of his band, the Haunted Graffiti.</p>\n<p>Drawing disparate conceits together and marrying them into a sound all his own, Pink has his fingers dipped in many different thematic pools, and has thus been hailed by contemporaries like Toro y Moi, Dâm-Funk and Kurt Vile as one of the foremost visionaries in today’s pop landscape. Others, such as Grimes, have less praiseful words to spend in regard of Pink blasting his frequent spew of politically incorrect statements regarding prevailing social issues like gay marriage, racism and sexism. Though these words have all come tinged with the specter of sardonic trolling, he remains a controversial figure, but undeniably talented and challenging.</p>\n<p>This year’s New Noise music festival is set to bring many exciting acts through venues across town.

Little did he know, the record became a smash hit across the country, landing the singer his first Grammy nomination for Song of the Year. The commercially successful record reached top of the charts on top 40 radio stations in countries in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, etc.</p>\n<p>Hozier, whose real name is Andrew Hozier-Byrne, was born in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. He began studying music in college, went on to sing in a travelling chorale ensemble, and finally got his big break by recoding demos for the studio heads at Universal Music. He then released his first EP with the same title of his now-famous record, with that title track and four more songs. The EP became a sensation on the Internet, going viral on YouTube and music streaming sites such as SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 14, 2014, Hozier released the full studio album, eponymously titled, to massive critical and commercial success. Singles from the album beside the most well-known song include “Work Song” and “Someone New,” which speaks of aspirations and failed relationships. The main allure behind Hozier’s record is not only that it is relatable (he could be the new male version of Taylor Swift. Goodbye, John Mayer), but it is also honest and real to human emotions.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lucky enough for Hozier fans in 805 areas and surrounding counties, the songwriter is coming to the Santa Barbara Bowl for a special concert performance on his worldwide tour.

The crowd was older than that of most Santa Barbara Bowl shows, although it was uplifting to see a spattering of young, crunchy, activist-types as well. There were many ex-flower child parents accompanied by eye-rolling teenagers.</p>\n<p>Resting in the sylvan scene was a gathering of activism booths termed “Neil’s Village,” with organizations in line with Young’s long-standing reputation for standing up for the American farmer. Representatives were present from farm justice groups such as Beneficial Insects, Permaculture Magazine, the Hollywood Food Guild/Center for Food Safety and a group fighting to overturn Citizens United and end corporate personhood called Move to Amend.</p>\n<p>Diana Reeves, Executive Director of GMO Free USA, who is on tour with Young, said, “He does have a Heart of Gold. I’ve cried before every concert.” Maybe the heroic troubadour was as kind in person as his music might lead listeners to believe. GMO Free USA is the leading GMO activist organization in the nation, advocating a higher standard of transparency and ethics in the food industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A small sign served as the only disruption in the idyllic grove, and it spelled out every concertgoer’s worst nightmare: “Show delayed until 7:30.” This was an hour after the show was scheduled.</p>\n<p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the stage darkened and simply dressed farmer women walked onto the stage, scattering seeds from small wicker baskets. Suddenly, in response to the eagerly chanting crowd, the spotlight illuminated Young himself sitting at a beat-down wooden piano on the corner of the stage. For a multiplatinum artist, he really did look unassuming, not even taking center stage in his show and appearing dressed in a wide-brimmed black hat, well-worn flannel, jeans and hiking shoes.</p>\n<p>He began the show solo with “After the Gold Rush,” and his voice sounded just as tender and heartfelt as it did upon the album’s release. When Young blew his first soul-wrenching note, the harmonica cut right through the sweaty concert air and the crowd responded with an enthusiastic scream.</p>\n<p>After the first four solo songs, the stage darkened for an unexpected bit of theatrics: Toxic green LEDs lit up the base of the stage in stark contrast to Young’s naturalist aesthetic, and gas-masked and hazmat-suited villains trudged onto the stage spraying smoke out of pesticide fumers. While some definitely found the effects over-the-top, I thought they were well-executed and harkened back to the stage theatrics of classic rock ’n’ roll. These dark heralds preceded the entrance of Promise of the Real, Young’s backing band for this tour and recording mates for <em>The Monsanto Years</em>.</p>\n<p>Although they obviously had big shoes to fill (through an unavoidable Crazy Horse comparison), PotR delivered their performance with the fervor and zeal of any of the heavy-hitting folk-rock bands back in the days of old. The shining star of the group was Willie Nelson’s son Lukas, who posed a striking presence strumming a weather-beaten Les Paul. Nelson took over lead vocals on a cover of Kurt Weill’s “September Song,” and his crooning tones sounded like his father was being channeled through him on the duet with Young. Noticeably different was his brother Micah Nelson. Micah clearly looked out of place as his constant power jumps, camouflage snapback and skin-tight black muscle tee made the impression that he had gotten lost on the way to Warped Tour.</p>\n<p>The show’s first half consisted of several of Young’s classic hits including “Helpless,” “Out on the Weekend,” “Only Love Can Break Your Heart,” and “Alabama.” On “Words (Between the Lines of Age),” the crowd lost their heads at Young and Nelson’s screeching guitar riffs. The group delved into material off of Young’s most recent release, this summer’s <em>Monsanto Years</em>. The four-song block of unfamiliar material seemed to drag on quite a bit. Many of the lyrics from Young’s newest album come off a little heavy-handed (several songs included the band repeatedly droning “Monsaantoooooooo”), although the crowd seemed very passionate about the issues and replied with their usual repertoire of cheers and fist-pumps.</p>\n<p>Young moved back into his older material for the remainder of the show and really harkened back to his psychedelic influences during “Down by the River” and “Time Fades Away,” breaking off into several-minute trance-like jam sessions. I heard one presumably stoned older fan behind me whisper, “It’s like they’re back in their garage, maaaaan.” As the show neared a close, Young stopped the performance for a so-called activist “hootenanny.”</p>\n<p>You could tell this is where his passions really lie, as he spoke truly from the heart about a new California Seed Law prohibiting the sharing of seeds more than three miles from where they left the ground, adding a seriously crippling restriction to state farmers. Young began to throw packets of seeds into the audience, calling out for cops to “come up here and arrest me.” While this might not have been as glamorous as protesting the Vietnam War, it was incredibly inspiring to see someone as late in his career as Young fighting for the things he loves.</p>\n<p>Finishing off the show with “Love and Only Love,” Young announced that they were approaching the Bowl’s curfew, and had to go. Of course this was only a jest, and the band returned to the stage a couple of minutes later for the inevitable encore.</p>\n<p>“I certainly hope we offend somebody,” Young announced. “We’ve only got a couple more minutes before we <em>really</em> have to leave, so we’ll try our hardest to shorten this song as much as we can…”</p>\n<p>The band, of course, did nothing of the sort. The encore song was “F***in’ Up,” and the audience went absolutely bananas for it. Both Young and Lukas Nelson took multiple fearsome guitar solos mid-song and sounded like they had descended from Valhalla itself. It was clear the audience was in a total frenzy, as even the begrudging teens at the show were jumping and shouting their lungs out at the folk-rock legend.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Young managed to break every single string on his guitar by the end of the encore. It was clear at this point that the group was fully intent on messing with their imposed curfew as much as possible. Trying to stretch the show and stick it to the sedate Santa Barbarans suffering from sleepiness, the band put the guitar track on a feedback loop and proceeded to lay Young’s guitar to rest underneath his sweat-drenched flannel while Young spent a couple of minutes playing with the whammy bar. They then went around the stage watering all of their plants (very urgent business, of course), and left the stage with the feedback still ringing. Their hilarious disregard for regulations and authority left the audience in high spirits.</p>\n<p>The very … enthusiastic concertgoer by the name of Penny Lane said, “Game changer. Mind rubber. Every day I wish that he’ll pull me up on stage and he didn’t, but it was definitely a close one this time.”</p>\n<p>“Keep it Neil” was embroidered on the back of her fringe jacket. It was hard to deny a bolstered connection to Young after this touching performance.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGTzMvXTUiY</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/","id":6898,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6897,6896,6895],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
