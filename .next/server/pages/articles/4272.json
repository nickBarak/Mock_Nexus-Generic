Ludicity’s proposal would provide an alternative festival to Deltopia. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial proposal of a festival led many UC Santa Barbara students and community members to believe that Lucidity’s event would completely shut down Deltopia, as expressed at the town hall. However, members of Lucidity’s board of directors negated these rumors and expressed its hopes that the alternative festival would develop a more positive, fun-filled environment that would help channel the Deltopia crowds into a safer space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not invested in doing this if people don’t want it,” Lucidity Director Ron Glover said. “We were asked to come and we decided we’d give it a shot… we don’t have a magic wand, but we’ve been successful at what we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has faced pushback from both sides of the community around its involvement in the event. Some UCSB students have expressed concern over parting with their beloved Deltopia tradition, while other Isla Vista residents present at the town hall noted they would prefer to abolish the event entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was [an] overwhelming response that students don’t want to see it rebranded,” Lucidity Founder and Marketing Director Jonah Gabriel Haas said. “It comes from an idea that this is going to change or take away their beloved Deltopia party, and that’s not what we’re trying to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its proposed Deltopia festival budget by $20,000, leaving it with a $159,850 price tag in order to get the program underway, which places special emphasis on harm reduction and collaboration with the community. This includes the unique concept of “Guardians,” a specially trained group of people dedicated to de-escalating situations to reduce the need for law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Guardian team would serve as a buffer between students and law enforcement so that the vast majority of things, whether they be medical or conflicts, can be de-escalated, mediated and taken care of before escalating to law enforcement,” Haas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the town hall, many concerned community members placed an emphasis on their fear of outsiders coming into I.V. and wreaking havoc with no sense of personal responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haas noted that Lucidity’s goal is “to make the event awesome enough for crowds to come off Del Playa, but not so awesome that we attract huge out-of-town crowds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team hopes to accomplish this by enlisting local artists to play at two different stages in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and People’s Park, which will hopefully encourage students to enjoy the music without drawing in outsiders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity also explained its hopes for a more family-friendly event in the future. However, the team acknowledged that since this is the first iteration of the event, they wanted to prioritize the age range that the original Deltopia appealed to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, UCSB’s A.S. Program Board commissioner, expressed her fears that Lucidity’s event would take away from the Program Board’s Warm Up event, which aims to act as a safe space that provides live music, drinks, snacks and other necessities to potentially inebriated students after Deltopia. She explained that after Deltopia and a Lucidity Festival, students might be too tired to attend the school-sanctioned nighttime event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also raised concern regarding the price tag, which the I.V. Community Services District explained would be covered by the district and other organizations who could potentially support the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that I think trying stuff is important and you won’t know… but it’s a $159,000 try,” Morrison said. “Can you justify spending that much on this event, rather than medical tents, drug testing, water or food that could help Deltopia in another way?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Lucidity returned to the point made at the beginning of the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If this works, it works, and we couldn’t ask for anything better,” Glover said. “If it doesn’t, we won’t do it again… instead of not trying, and saying what if it doesn’t work, well, what if it does?”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

He said he believes that businesses need to step up to provide their patrons with sustainable options, especially in a town as environmentally conscious as I.V.</p>\n<p>“There is something to be said about the people who did it when it was the right thing to do and not the optimal thing to do according to market demand,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>Daniela Schwartz, co-leader of the OFR program within the UCSB Surfrider branch, echoed Yamasaki’s words: “Young people are always looking to do environmentally friendly things that are good for our planet.”</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.surfrider.org/programs/ocean-friendly-restaurants\">Surfrider’s website</a>, the perks of being OFR-certified include national recognition on Surfrider social media, logos and other marketing materials, launch parties, collaborative promotions and, in some cases, tax-deductible contributions.</p>\n<p>Surfrider was founded in 1984 to protect ocean health, according to the website. The organization focuses on water quality, beach access and preservation and the protection of marine ecosystems.</p>\n<p>One of the ways it operates is through the OFR program, which, according to the website, was founded in 2010 to combat the disposal of single-use plastics by restaurants. The program “increases awareness, drives behavior change, and ultimately creates scalable impact to reduce our plastic footprint.”</p>\n<p>According to Schwartz, restaurants in I.V. are reluctant to commit to OFR status because there is an assumption that sustainable practices are expensive and exhaustive. This widely held belief is perhaps rooted in the fee associated with becoming an OFR, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz explained that the OFR fee is $62.50 per year, and that the cost of committing to sustainable products does not make a difference in the broader financial success of restaurants. Cajé made minimal changes in order to receive OFR status, with the most significant being the elimination of polystyrene products and plastic bags, Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>While Yamasaki agreed that attaining OFR status was not a financial burden for Cajé, he said that while the current demand for sustainable dining practices is still small, “the market will demand it eventually and we are already seeing small shifts. The awareness is there and appreciated, but as far as actively producing new sales, we are on the cusp.”</p>\n<p>Although Cajé is the first restaurant in I.V. to receive OFR status, there are other OFR certified restaurants in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, including Mesa Burger, Jane at the Marketplace, Old Town Coffee, the Boathouse at Hendry’s Beach and the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Schwartz hopes that making Cajé more sustainable will produce a domino effect in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to move beyond coffee shops to get a real restaurant [to become OFR certified],” she said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz and her team have presented the benefits of being OFR certified to the managers of Silvergreens and South Coast Deli in hopes that they will soon follow suit.</p>\n<p>While Schwartz thinks that it is unrealistic for all I.V. restaurants to become OFR certified, she believes that the OFR program is gaining traction this year.</p>\n<p>“Good habits that begin with OFR get carried on throughout life. The ball is rolling. We are hoping to get in touch with more restaurants as the year goes on, and to spread the word about being more sustainable in any way we can,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/","id":4269,"author":{"id":273,"name":"Madeline Myers"},"related":[4268,4267,4266],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB vs Texas St. Results in 4-4 Tie","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Immediately following its loss in the first of Sunday’s scheduled games, the UCSB baseball team attempted to salvage the final game of the series but were unable to push the go-ahead run in the latt...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81756\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"747547114\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82132\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81756\" data-attachment-id=\"81756\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-10/gauchos-drop-pitchers-duel-in-opening-game-against-texas-state/luke-andrews-pitches-to-the-batter-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Luke Andrews pitches to the batter.

After a walk and single allowed by Clements, the run was brought home from third on a scoring sacrifice fly tying the game at one a piece.</p>\n<p>UCSB had their biggest offensive inning in the second where five runners each reached base. Leigh quickly allowed the bases to be loaded after Sam Cohen and Jason Willow each singled and Michael McAdoo was walked. The bases-loaded pressure clearly rattled the Bobcat’s starter, as evidenced by the two more walks he would allow, and essentially gave UCSB an effortless 3-1 lead once the Bobcats made the final out.</p>\n<p>Similar to the first inning, the Gauchos’ redshirt junior allowed the first batter he faced on base and was unfortunately never able to recover for the rest of the 3rd inning. The runner was subsequently able to get around to third on a two-out single to Jaylen Hubbard where he was finally brought home on a single to left by senior Luke Sherley. The Bobcats would put up another run in the frame off of a bases clearing, double by freshman John Wuthrich to give his team the lead 4-3. The extra-base blow was too much for Clements as he was pulled with one out remaining in the inning in exchange for Luke Andrews in relief.</p>\n<p>Leigh would go on to allow two hits in the fourth inning, giving the Gauchos the run they needed to tie the game at 4-4. The game would subsequently be called in the 8th inning as a tie, due to a travel regulation for the visiting team.</p>\n<p>The appearances by Luke Andrews and Chris Troye always kept UCSB in the game, as both pitchers were able to absolutely stifle the Texas State batters who could not come up with an answer to the Gaucho bullpen. From just before the third inning until the end of the game the two relievers would pitch a combined two-hitter with seven strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone the Bobcat bullpen was equally stellar in their relief appearances as three reliever hurled their own two-hitter after the fourth inning. The bullpens four innings of work preserved the lead for their team as starter Zachary Leigh’s struggles nearly became too much for Texas State to recover from.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play their next game at home against Dartmouth University Wednesday, March 14 at 3 p.m. PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"
