And while many theaters admitted only industry types with festival passes, getting a ticket for a Sundance movie is really as simple as having three things: 20 bucks, good timing on the ticket page and a way to get to the theater in time to grab a seat. Even locals who were unable to snag tickets participated in the festivities, bundling up to roam around Main Street in search of celebrities to take selfies with.</p>\n<p>Prior to attending, I imagined the awards were carefully deliberated upon by an elite, Academy-style group of old white people behind closed doors. In reality, anyone catching a screening of a competing film was allowed and encouraged to rank it for the Audience Awards competition. I definitely enjoyed turning in my ballots and giving some films their laurels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>… but people still really know their shit</strong></p>\n<p>The crowd at Sundance was a stew of different types of people. But whether film and entertainment was their passion, their job or both, any given Sundancer proved very intellectual about the subject matter at hand.</p>\n<p>This hit me when a guy next to me in a theater mentioned a film he saw at Cannes and, for a second, it didn’t register that he was talking about the French film festival because he didn’t pronounce the “s” because anyone who has been to France knows the French never pronounce the “s” at the end of the word. Most people I sat next to at screenings, stood with in line or schmoozed with at wine &amp; cheese-ers were open and eager to talk about their cool jobs, projects they were working on, the movies they’d loved or hated and why they loved or hated them and, of course, celebrity spottings. Conversation was rarely superficial, and this respectful, reverent mentality created a unique, stimulating atmosphere in Park City.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A note on hype</strong></p>\n<p>This heightened atmosphere proved the ideal environment to watch movies in. Many of the films I saw at Sundance were world premieres, so audiences had nothing to go off of when taking their seats except for the cursory synopses on the festival’s website. This seemed absolutely crazy; when was the last time you saw a movie with zero expectations?</p>\n<p>We live in the world of Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB reviews, where we watch trailers before YouTube videos of other trailers, where filmmakers and actors perform variations of the same interview with a billion different coverage outlets, where people tweet stuff like “Interstellar was the most mindblowing thing of my liiiffe” before we get the chance to let “Interstellar” blow our own minds. “Boyhood,” which debuted at the festival last year, was critically acclaimed, but some might argue that the simple slices of life in the film were undeserving of such hype. At Sundance, there isn’t any hype to live up to. The movies speak for themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Also: Global warming is the worst.</strong></p>\n<p>Besides the movies, something I was really excited to experience was falling snow, something I haven’t seen in years. It snowed for a combined total of three minutes during the five days I spent in Park City. While it was definitely cold and there were layers on layers of snow all over the ground and on the slopes surrounding PC, Sundance has been marked by uncharacteristically warm weather for Utah Januaries in recent years. Which sucks. But I digress. In the words of Ari Gold, “You don’t come to Sundance for the snow, you come for the heat,” and the heat was brought in the festival’s strong lineup of films this year. Here’s a rundown of a few of the buzziest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”</strong></p>\n<p>The hilarious and sad story of Greg (“Project X’s” Thomas Mann), a high school senior who reluctantly befriends a classmate with leukemia (the titular Dying Girl, “Ouija’s” Olivia Cooke), “Me and Earl” was greeted with a well-deserved standing ovation at its premier. Strong performances by stars Mann, Cooke and newcomer RJ Cyler (who plays Earl) are backed up by a great supporting cast including Connie Britton (“Friday Night Lights”), Nick Offerman (“Parks and Recreation”) and Molly Shannon (“SNL” and, like, everything else).</p>\n<p>“Me and Earl” gives a refreshing realism to teenagers by treating them like people dealing with complex situations instead of one-dimensional kids. Bolstered by Wes-Anderson-lite cinematography and a score as simultaneously heavy- and light-hearted as the plot is, director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon presents a film that made audiences laugh until they cried and cry until they laughed, earning its Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award in the dramatic competition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Z for Zachariah”</strong></p>\n<p>“Z for Zachariah” is a post-apocalyptic love triangle starring Margot Robbie (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Chiwetel Ejiofor (“12 Years a Slave”) and Chris Pine (“Star Trek”) as the last three people on earth. The film spends little time dwelling on the nature of the calamity that ended the world. Instead, it explores the tense, personal story of — to paraphrase director Craig Zobel in a Q&amp;A session — how big the stakes are when the person you’re talking to is quite literally the only person you can talk to.</p>\n<p>An intimate case study, “Zachariah” represents an especially noteworthy turn for Robbie. By balancing the moral greys of the men vying for her affections, she proves that she has many skills in her repertoire disparate from being Leo’s second, hotter wife.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Sleeping with Other People”</strong></p>\n<p>Described by director Leslye Headland as “‘When Harry Met Sally’ for assholes,” “Sleeping” is a romcom about Lainey (“Community’s” Allison Brie) and Jake (Jason Sudeikis, “Horrible Bosses”), who lose touch after losing their virginities to each other in college and meet up by chance years later at a sex addiction meeting.</p>\n<p>The movie has big laughs and scenes that could definitely go down in comedy infamy (the term “Dirty DJ” and bottles of green tea might not mean anything together now, but once you see the movie, your mind might begin to wander the next time you’re sipping on an Arizona). Despite its funniness, the film also deals with heartbreak and complex feelings not often included in the romcom package, and while there were times where it lost track of its tone while toeing the line between comedy and drama, I’d say it did its job in delivering both.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“The Witch”</strong></p>\n<p>Displaying an artsiness characteristically absent in horror movies these days, “The Witch” is a dark film about a family with issues. The story is set in a painstakingly researched and recreated 1600s New England homestead on the edge of a foreboding forest harboring, you guessed it, a witch.</p>\n<p>An appropriately haunting score of ghostly wails helps to carry the dark tale as it unwinds. The real scares here don’t jump out at you or stab you in the back; they creep up and come to heads as family members turn against each other when the worst starts to go down. It’s a “Shining”-style psychological terror. While it definitely could’ve been scarier, Robert Eggers deserves his Directing Award in the dramatic category for showing us that horror doesn’t revolve around thoughtless blood-soaked threequels.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/utah-report-i-went-to-sundance-and-it-was-awesome/","id":6085,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6084,6083,6082],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne","biography":"Not available","articles":[5894,5901,6085,6537,6736,6740,6797,6836,6841,6887,6896,6908,6982,7671],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Responses to Ask an Atheist: Interpreting the Bible as Gay-Friendly","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Here’s a gay-friendly interpretation of the Bible from a Christian: The Bible says that homosexual relations is a sin in the same way that heterosexual sexual relations is a sin outside of marriage....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Here’s a gay-friendly interpretation of the Bible from a Christian: The Bible says that homosexual relations is a sin in the same way that heterosexual sexual relations is a sin outside of marriage. The famous verse used to condemn homosexuals or accuse Christians of condemnation is Leviticus 20:13. The surrounding verses are often overlooked. Leviticus 20:10-16 contain death penalties for four different types of sexual immorality among heterosexuals, two types of sexual immorality concerning bestiality and one mention of immorality concerning homosexuals. In the same way, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 condemn not only homosexuals, but also the sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, drunkards, revilers, swindlers and the greedy. Although verses 9 and 10 condemn, the following verse, 1 Corinthians 6:11, justifies stating that this is how man was while he was stuck in his sin, but now man has been washed, made clean and justified in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>Does the Bible show proof that homosexual relations are a sin? Yes. The Bible has much more overwhelming proof that God loves ALL humans and will stop at nothing to provide all men with the opportunity to gain salvation, no matter their sexual orientation. Jesus Christ came to earth to save man while man was stuck in his sin. He did not give man a list of rules to achieve salvation; He put in all the work for us. In the same way, Jesus will save ALL who believe and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and was raised from the dead (Romans 10:9-11).</p>\n<p>The Bible would say that homosexual relations is the same as any other sin, condemnable by nature and that Jesus Christ provides salvation for all human beings, despite their sexual orientation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Our votes don’t make a difference; nobody cares if I vote.” The thing is, guys, you’re wrong about all of it. Yes, your votes matter; yes, they do make a difference and yes, people care whether or not you vote. Who cares if students vote? Well, for one, Anna Vlahos certainly does.</p>\n<p>Last week, Ms. Vlahos, the Executive Director of Stop Voter Fraud, sent an open letter to the Santa Barbara Voter Registration Office asking them to discount voter registrations from before 2010. Sound sketchy and questionably legal? Just wait, it gets better. See, Vlahos isn’t concerned with the integrity of voter registration in Santa Barbara County as a whole — her request specifically targets UCSB and Isla Vista, citing the “transient” nature of the student population, which does sound like a reasonable argument until you actually stop to think about it.</p>\n<p>This request is just the latest in a series of attempts by this group to disenfranchise the student population in Isla Vista. The group itself was formed in support of a county supervisor candidate who lost the election three years ago and attempted to have every ballot cast in Isla Vista thrown out by accusing student groups of voter fraud. The accusations of voter fraud were roundly dismissed by every court to hear it, but that hasn’t kept Stop Voter Fraud from continuing their attempts to exclude students from the electoral process. After their efforts to throw out student votes after the 2008 election failed, it appears SVF has developed a new strategy: prevent students from voting at all in the June 5 primary. Apparently they don’t buy into the idea that everyone should have a say in government, at least not when there’s an election on the line.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So, what can you do about it?

A legal heroin habit cost less than tobacco addiction (50¢ per week) and “drug crime” was unknown. Search the historic archives in vain trying to find robberies, burglaries or assaults associated with drugs when they were legal. The term “drug crime” is an invention of prohibitionists trying to cover the effects of their failed drug policy.</p>\n<p>In the United States, unintentional opiate overdose deaths were extremely rare before drugs were outlawed. Almost all drug deaths before the Harrison Narcotic Act were suicides. Nowadays, the Drug Czar tells us there are more than 30,000 accidental drug deaths every year. The term “drug death” is an alibi to cover the deadly effects of drug prohibition. Most drug fatalities in those days were caused by suicides and a few murders, but accidental overdose deaths were exceedingly rare.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Proof that hard-line drug policies cause drug crimes and drug deaths comes from the Swiss Heroin Maintenance Program where addicts are supplied with cheap, pure heroin and cocaine. The Swiss have not had a single overdose death in the program, and injection-transmitted diseases (HIV/AIDS, Hep C, etc.) are now a rarity in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>The criminal drug black market has vanished in Switzerland since the Swiss began providing addicts with cheap, legal drugs. The success of the Swiss Heroin Maintenance Program in causing a more than 97 percent reduction in addict crime in Switzerland is something drug crusaders do not want to discuss.</p>\n<p>Swiss policy has also resulted in an 82 percent decrease in heroin addiction since 1990, which is unequaled by any American drug policy. Besides these concrete benefits, the Swiss report saving over $100 per day per addict in police, incarceration and health care expenses. The Swiss are so pleased with the results of Heroin Maintenance that they made this their national drug policy.</p>\n<p>Using jail cells to treat addicts has not achieved similar success anywhere in the world since 1914.
