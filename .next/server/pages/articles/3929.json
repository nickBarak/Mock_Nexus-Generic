One incident resulted in a death and the second subject did not die, but also did not fully recover.</p>\n<p>SBSO worked with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and its Emergency Medical Services Agency last year to develop the Naloxone Program to combat the increasing number of overdoses in the county.</p>\n<p>Naloxone hydrochloride is the active ingredient in the prescription drug Narcan, a nasal spray that stops the effects of opioids, including extreme drowsiness, slowed breathing and loss of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Between 2011 and 2016, the Sheriff’s Coroner Unit observed a marked increase in overdose deaths. Opioids were present in approximately 65 percent of the overdose deaths that occurred in Santa Barbara County in 2016, according to the program press release.</p>\n<p>“Sheriff Brown, in conjunction with Dr. Gleghorn from SB County Behavioral Wellness recognized that opioid deaths were increasing throughout the country and that overall overdose deaths were increasing in SB County,” Bonner said in an email.</p>\n<p>SB County experienced 30 deaths due to all opioid-related overdoses in 2016, according to the most recent calendar year of data available.</p>\n<p>“At this point a number of initial first responder naloxone programs throughout the United States were showing significant promise in decreasing the number of people that die from opioid overdoses,” Bonner said.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, a 19-year-old male UC Santa Barbara student who was suffering from an apparent overdose in I.V. was administered naloxone and then transported to the hospital, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/ucsb-student-hospitalized-after-apparent-overdose-police-administer-naloxone/\">reported</a>. Police found the student unconscious, but he survived the incident and woke up soon after the spray was administered.</p>\n<p>Police then administered naloxone to two other victims in I.V. in December, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-29/two-apparent-overdoses-in-isla-vista-within-24-hours-victims-receive-doses-of-naloxone/\">reported</a>. The first victim was a 23-year-old male and the second was a 20-year-old man. In both cases, the victims were found struggling to breathe before police administered naloxone.</p>\n<p>In 2015, there were 7.7 opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 residents in SB County and 193 incidents of 911-emergency calls where Narcan was administered by first responders.</p>\n<p>The number of 911-emergency calls where a first responder used Narcan increased in 2016 to 260.</p>\n<p>According to an SBSO press release about the Naloxone Program, sheriff patrol personnel were trained to know when to give Naloxone to block the effects of opioids.</p>\n<p>According to the Narcan <a href=\"https://www.narcan.com/faqs\">website</a>, naloxone reverses the effects of opioid overdose in two to three minutes, which gives the opioid-poisoned person time for emergency medical help to arrive.</p>\n<p>According to Michelle Wehmer, the SB County Public Health Department epidemiologist, Narcan can be administered for several reasons, including when a first responder sees a subject not breathing and decides to administer the drug, during an accidental drug overdose due to confusion of being on several medications and recreational narcotics use such as snorting and ingestion.</p>\n<p>The amount of training an agency or staff person has received can affect the likelihood of a responder to administer Narcan. Naloxone is only effective for opioid drug overdoses.</p>\n<p>First responders do not always know which drugs the patient might have ingested, which makes training more helpful for deputies who are now administering the drug on duty.</p>\n<p>According to the Narcan<a href=\"https://www.narcan.com/faqs\"> website</a>, the nasal spray should be administered immediately and does not take the place of emergency medical care.</p>\n<p>It is advised that emergency medical help is sought right away after giving the first dose of Narcan even if the person wakes up because they may relapse into breathing difficulty.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Feb. 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor race, Bruce Porter, held an early lead in the voting booths, while news sources were reporting that the country’s new president would be inheriting a politically fractured nation.</p>\n<p>Democrats everywhere felt the sobering start of a new era with President Donald Trump’s election later that night, but Hartmann was supposed to be celebrating a milestone in her public service career — <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\">her appointment as a county supervisor</a>.</p>\n<p>Hartmann and Gina Fischer, a highly-involved staff member in Hartmann’s Isla Vista projects and representative for the Third District office, agree that the night of the election was a somber time. In response, Fischer said some constituents turned to Hartmann and local government to ease their dissatisfaction with national politics.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the fact that her election coincided with Trump’s placed an additional responsibility on her office to listen to constituents and bring people together rather than divide them.</p>\n<p>Constituents from I.V. and UC Santa Barbara in particular would be expecting focused representation for their communities from Hartmann. When those precincts were counted, Hartmann’s votes took a significant jump.</p>\n<p>In return for their votes, Hartmann has had a busy and effective year working on I.V. infrastructure, public safety and support for the I.V. Community Services District, which has benefitted from donations from Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p>She has worked to get the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) off the ground, giving the newly-formed government start-up funds, leasing them the previous Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr’s office and giving them a space to provide programs in the community room of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Because a large number of the county’s residents live in unincorporated areas, it is Hartmann’s responsibility to represent those constituents, making I.V.’s self-determination through the CSD even more important.</p>\n<p>“I am always scampering around from Guadalupe to Vandenberg Village to Los Alamos to Solvang to I.V. to here in Santa Barbara. So now I.V. has its own government, and to see that begin to take shape is really exciting,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Fischer said Hartmann’s office is interested in “culturing conditions for [the] CSD to grow,” giving the new government an opportunity to represent its constituents in a way that might previously have been more difficult through the county.</p>\n<p>“We’re watching something very exciting be born and I’m delighted to be one of the midwives of many for that process,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board Chair Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday he’s had “nothing but good experiences” working with Hartman and her staff, saying she has always been attentive and willing to help constituents.</p>\n<p>“Without Supervisor Hartmann’s early support, we wouldn’t have been able to begin providing services so quickly,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s office contributed $3,000 from their discretionary funds in the last fiscal year and $2,000 in the current year, he said, which has helped the district in their start-up costs.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the I.V. CSD has created an internship program in collaboration with UCSB’s Department of Political Science, managed scheduling for the community room and launched an expansion of the Community Service Organization’s escort program.</p>\n<p>The District has also developed a policy manual, hired legal counsel and acquired insurance, fulfilling critical steps in its formation.</p>\n<p>Bertrand expressed praise for Hartmann’s work in I.V. and said that the county’s infrastructure improvements have been especially helpful for her constituents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/\">The county Public Works Department installed a stoplight in August</a> at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte, citing a need to mitigate the amounts of collisions in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/\">The county also installed a sidewalk</a> on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road last spring.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Hartmann’s work on public safety issues through the I.V. Safe task force has helped people better understand the issues they are facing in the community through her focus on the data involved in these subjects.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said her office’s number one priority is to keep students safe and said she was pleased that this year’s Halloween weekend saw fewer arrests and medical transports.</p>\n<p>While Hartmann has focused on helping her constituents by attempting to support I.V.’s bid for self-governance through the CSD, a main focus of hers going forward will be helping the Community Center become a source for community programming for her diverse constituency.</p>\n<p>“We got a grant for $460,000 to add to money that the county had already invested in the community center, and then we had to delay opening the community center,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We expect to bring everybody in Isla Vista from different age groups, different ethnicities, different — not everyone will be students — and hope that we can create a stronger sense of belonging to the I.V. community,” she said.</p>\n<p>She said she also hopes to soon build a “pipeline” between UCSB and the county to bring students into the county.</p>\n<p>Despite what she said was a “steep learning curve” to the first year of her term, Hartmann said the work has been fun, and she has built connections with I.V. officials like Bertrand who have said working with her is a “true pleasure.”</p>\n<p>Constituents will continue to look for strong leadership in Hartmann and other local elected officials, as students and I.V. residents have shown that they are resistant to the changes occurring on the national level.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Critics accuse her of advocating for the war, despite doubts about the credibility of the intelligence regarding the building of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>\n<p>This dissension caused the debut of a protest group called the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective.<br>\nMembers of the newly formed organization greeted attendees with chants such as “Lock her up” and “Arrest the war criminal.”</p>\n<p>While Rice avoided the topic of the demonstrators, she made an effort to justify her decisions in the 2003 invasion.</p>\n<p>Rice explained that Iraq was difficult to predict. As the National Security Advisor at the time, she believed that data concluded that Saddam Hussein was working toward weapons of mass destruction.<br>\nThough the invasion showed this presumption was incorrect, Rice felt she had reacted appropriately under the precarious circumstances.</p>\n<p>Despite this argument, demonstrators continued to voice their disapproval.</p>\n<p>“I’m upset that they’re bringing in Condi Rice to speak at UCSB as if she was a legitimate authority on anything,” Howard Winant, UCSB professor of sociology, said. “She used her academic credentials to manipulate and murder and torture and commit war crimes.”</p>\n<p>Cara Yoshizumi, one of the founders of the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective, protested due to a more general anti-war sentiment.</p>\n<p>“So much of our country’s resources go into war and killing and environmental destruction,” Yoshizumi said. “The U.S. is an advanced and rich country, and yet we don’t have things like free education and free health care, like most advanced countries do. All of that is because of misplaced priorities, like the war in Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Some of the audience attended not in support, but instead to critique and gain perspective on Rice.<br>\n“We are not here in support of her, we just want an abstract of what she’s about,” audience member Jeff Smith said.</p>\n<p>“She was definitely a part of it… she’s guilty,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Inside, Rice talked identity politics, criticizing Donald Trump’s “America First” slogan.<br>\nShe contested that a “confident country” is focused on an international level of “larger good,” not just the success of Americans. Rice defined this as spreading democracy and balancing trade.</p>\n<p>In her Q&amp;A session, Rice voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement, but referred to kneeling for the National Anthem as divisive symbolism.</p>\n<p>The self-proclaimed feminist also criticized the #MeToo movement. She said that though she overall supported and praised the purpose it served, she warned against oversensitivity of followers.</p>\n<p>Rice voiced concern that young women wouldn’t be equipped for the real world, stating she hoped the movement didn’t teach that “women can’t take care of themselves, because they can.”</p>\n<p>On immigration policy, Rice took a positive approach, stating, “immigration has been the lifeblood of this country.”</p>\n<p>Rice reproached Trump’s decision to build a wall between the Mexico and United States border, stating that “a wall doesn’t have to be a physical thing.”</p>\n<p>She backed this argument by claiming that net immigration from Mexico is zero. Rice said that Central America is the source of criminal immigrants, making the wall ineffective.</p>\n<p>Though Rice called the past year’s number of 40,000 refugees under the Trump administration lacking, she did suggest capping the number at 70,000.</p>\n<p>She broke down the modern system for integrating immigrants through private charities. She explained that a number above 70,000 would be too strenuous on the system, potentially causing it to collapse.</p>\n<p>Despite protests and critics, a large number of attendees showed support for Rice by reflecting on her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>“Her education, she was a pianist, she was considered to be a position in the football commission, and she’s a woman… this shows she’s a well-rounded leadership type,” Santa Barbara resident Grace Johnson said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

of what is considered to be a normal amount of rainfall for this time. The Cachuma Reservoir received only 42 percent of the typical amount, and Santa Barbara County altogether received 25 percent of normal rainfall.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreased rainfall, the report showed impacts on water quality in the reservoir due to the fires. Due to the most recent rain event on Jan. 9, the reservoir received 500 acre-feet of inflow. It is unknown how much of this inflow was composed of ash or mud.</p>\n<p>According to Kelley Dyer, water supply manager for the City of Santa Barbara, the inflow to the reservoir can be treated, but it takes about three weeks for the sediment, including ash and mud, to settle out, so the county has been pulling from other sources.</p>\n<p>The impact of the Thomas, Whittier and Rey Fires on water quality and supply of the Cachuma, Gibraltar, and State water supply “will last for years,” Dyer said.</p>\n<p>This year “has been one of the driest on record, just a bit better than the 2014-2015 year,” which was the worst to date, Santa Barbara City Councilmember Eric Friedman said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“We’re taking this seriously and looking ahead … We were one of two counties that were not out of the drought last year while the rest of the state was,” he added.</p>\n<p>The report showed the impact of rainfall from Sep. 1, 2017, to Jan. 29, 2018 in Santa Barbara, as well as the county’s two main sources for water supply.</p>\n<p>“Rainfall, as you may expect, is very low,” said Joshua Haggmark, a water resources manager for the City of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Due to the recent fires and lack of rain, the water supply is diminished from previous years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80836\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"962128473\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80834\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80836\" data-attachment-id=\"80836\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-06/santa-barbara-county-continues-to-experience-severe-drought/charred-hillside-noozhawk-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?fit=1000%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80836\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charred-Hillside-Noozhawk.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Noozhawk</em></p></div>\n<p>This is a significant change from the report of rainfall during this time last year.</p>\n<p>From Dec. 10, 2016, to Jan. 23, 2017, the impact of of rainfall was much higher in Santa Barbara County and its sources of water.
