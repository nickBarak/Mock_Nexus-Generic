On Dec. 9, hundreds of graduate students went on a wildcat strike, meaning the strike is not authorized by their union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students, as part of their strike, refused to release over 12,000 undergraduate grades by the submission deadline of Dec. 18 until the university agreed to a COLA of $1,412 a month to supplement their current TA salaries. The university refused, and this past Monday, UCSC graduate students began an indefinite full wildcat strike, meaning a strike without the authorization of their union, UC Student-Workers Union (UAW Local 2865). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of the UC COLA movements is the concept of rent burden, defined as spending more than 30% of one’s wages on rent, according to the UCSC COLA website. Students’ rent burdens vary from campus to campus, but across the UC, organizers have been using rent burden to calculate COLAs specific to their respective universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While only the UCSC COLA movement has officially gone on strike, several other UCs, such as UCSB and UCSD, have now drafted and presented demands to leadership at their respective universities. At other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley and UC Davis, COLA movements are in their infancy, but are growing fast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with organizers at various UC campuses to document their COLA movements and the stages each movement is in. </span></p>\n<p>Further coverage of UCSB’s COLA movement can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>UC Santa Cruz:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students finished their third day on strike on Wednesday; throughout the day, hundreds of graduate students linked arms and blocked the intersection at the base of UCSC’s campus, facing off against a blockade of police officers and disrupting bus services. At least 16 people were arrested and given citations, City on a Hill Press reported, but as of 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, only one remained in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a press release sent out by the UCSC COLA movement, at</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> least one student allegedly “had her finger broken by police, another was bleeding profusely from his head after being hit by batons, and others received bruised ribs and bones.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association, explained that at UCSC, the demand for a COLA officially began in November, when graduate students presented their demands to the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Cruz students pay 50, 60, 70% of their wages of rent per month, which makes it next to impossible to afford most other things, especially if you have medical copays or childcare or any kind of emergency,” Komori said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSC graduate students are on an indefinite strike; those who are a part of the COLA movement are not holding office hours and sections and will not release undergraduate students’ fall quarter and upcoming winter quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said that last week, UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive offered new programs for graduate students that would help offset the cost of living, such as one that offers five years of funding at their current pay rate, and another than would provide a $2,500 a year housing supplement or fellowship for those in need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Komori called the offers “insufficient,” and said that showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the last she heard, administration would be starting “disciplinary action against the strike.” Several graduate students posted to social media about receiving disciplinary hearing summons and formal warning letters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Monday, upwards of 1,500 UCSC undergraduate students have also signed a petition in support of their graduate students, Komori said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said the university is now refusing to meet with the striking graduate students now that they are “carrying out an unsanctioned strike.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been updating through the Twitter account </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@payusmoreucsc and on the website payusmoreucsc.com. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon said the strike at UCSC is “illegal” and that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC San Diego: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC San Diego’s COLA movement began last year, when the university’s Housing, Dining and Hospitality Unit — the equivalent of UCSB’s Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises — planned to increase graduate students’ rents for on-campus apartments, according to Celine Khoury, a doctoral student in literature and recording secretary within the San Diego chapter of United Automobile Workers (UAW) Local 2865, the UC-wide union representing graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students held a housing march to protest the plan, but the unit raised the price of rent regardless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was out of this momentum that the UCSD COLA movement formed, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our [graduate students] make up 15% of our workforce,” Khoury said. “UCSD has the largest number of academic employees out of all of the UCs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a UCSD COLA fact sheet posted to the movement’s Twitter account, graduate teaching assistants made $2,434 a month, and a majority of them paid over 42% of their monthly wages in rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khoury described the UCSD COLA moment as very “grassroots” and “collaborative,” explaining that there are a number of members of the UCSD COLA movement that are also involved with the UCSD Graduate Student Association (GSA) and the campus union, UAW 2865. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this week, the UCSD GSA unanimously passed a resolution that supported both the striking UCSC workers as well as any future action taken by graduate students at UC San Diego, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, approximately 80 members of the UCSD COLA movement, alongside a few campus groups and undergraduates, held a “peaceful march” across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group made its way to UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla’s office, where they planned on delivering their demands, which include providing all student workers with housing stipends that translate to between $1,400 and $3,100 a month; lowering rent on all existing on-campus housing; and building affordable on-campus housing for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Khosla didn’t open the door, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, organizers “chanted the letter” and, before they left, “taped all of our signs to the chancellor’s door and the [outside] walls of his office.” Now, they are waiting for the chancellor to respond to their demands. The UCSD COLA movement also held a public forum Wednesday night, open to all students and faculty, to provide updates on the UC-wide COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ColaUcsd. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Rich, a doctoral student in English at UC Davis, said the UCD COLA movement began in December, in solidarity with the UCSC COLA movement. Several other UC COLA movements also held rallies in solidarity with UCSC on the same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our initial purpose was to just try and support them, but we pretty quickly, like a lot of other campuses, were realizing that we have a lot of similar problems that Santa Cruz is having … so we used that first event as a jumping off point.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich said the movement is currently composed of a smaller group of graduate students rather than an entire organization. They plan to attend their UCD GSA meeting and talk to the local union members about how to broaden the movement, Rich said, and they’re also starting to reach out to undergraduates as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Rich is hoping they can draft a list of demands that also would help with equity between departments or guaranteed summer funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few members of the UCD COLA movement also travelled to UC Santa Cruz to support the strikers; according to the @ucd4cola Twitter account, one of the UCD COLA organizers was among those arrested during the Wednesday UCSC COLA strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ucd4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Berkeley: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tara Phillips, UAW 2865 and UC Berkeley COLA organizer, said the COLA movement at UC Berkeley is “still in its infancy,” noting that it was difficult to get a COLA movement off the ground because the campus union wasn’t supportive of the movement “until recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement’s first action was in December, she said, when around 70 people held a solidarity rally for UCSC strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] talked about how difficult it is to get by here, how precarious the lives of grad students are because pay is so low and rent is so high,” Phillips said. “Folks were talking about landlord abuse and the inability to pay for medical treatment, loans that folks need to take out just to supplement their income … [but] also how much we love teaching, and that we wish the university valued it more.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phillips said that while most graduate students pay 50% or more of their wages on rent, that payment only lasts for 10 months of the year — nine months for the UC campuses on the quarter system — and most students “have to scramble over the summer to get rent money together, because teaching is not guaranteed in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re living very stressful, financially precarious lives for a long time,” she said, adding that she believes the university has done a “very poor job” in terms of equity across the various UC Berkeley departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly – the equivalent of UCSB’s GSA – and UAW 2863 passed a resolution in support of the UCSC strike last week, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Phillips said the movement is “just starting to map out what the future looks like for us, and how to keep building that movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re sort of in this educational phase … but ideally we’d like to be able to turn out a lot of graduate students to a general assembly, and discuss collectively what we want, what our demands look like, and how to pressure the administration to give us a COLA.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that UAW 2865 came up with a projected COLA for UC Berkeley to bring students out of rent burden — $2,103, the highest number so far across the UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting on the Facebook page “Cal COLA: Pay Us More UCB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Los Angeles: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA GSA President Zak Fisher, who attends UCLA School of Law, explained that after UCSC students went on strike, the conversation of a UCLA COLA became a “hot topic of conversation.” He noted, however, that there is “no official club” for a UCLA COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen this campus today engaging this important question of, ‘How do we fight for a cost-of-living adjustment or for cost-of-living issues more generally?’ I haven’t met a graduate student yet who said, ‘No way, we get paid enough, what are you doing?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that he ran for GSA president on a platform of creating a cost-of-living adjustment for graduate students, among other issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, graduate students are spreading a survey around in hopes of getting a better idea of how rent-burdened students are, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As GSA president, Fisher said he has spoken to administrators about the issues that he ran on, but “they’ll give you lip service all day, saying ‘Hey, these are important issues,’ but then you’ll meet with them three months later and say, ‘Oh, what have you done? Absolutely nothing.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he’s seen support from UCLA undergraduate students as well, noting that the undergraduate student government and the GSA unanimously passed a resolution in support for UCSC strikers, demanding that there be no retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone is starting to realize, this is our collective fight and our collective struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting under the Twitter handle @ucla4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB COLA Outreach Committee member Adam Parison confirmed that a “pretty small” COLA movement was beginning at UC Riverside, but that the movement has no social media platforms yet, and Parison could not provide contact information for any COLA organizers at UCR.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The Patriots were getting smoked by the Atlanta Falcons.<br>\nTom Brady had been rushed, sacked and picked off all within the span of the first half, and it seemed as though Super Bowl victory No. 5 was just about out of reach for the New England Patriots.<br>\nThe score was 28-3 late in the third quarter, and nobody expected a blowout this bad.<br>\nComing back from such a big deficit would have been an impossible feat for most teams and for most quarterbacks … but not for Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.<br>\nNew England had scored 17 unanswered points, and it was officially a ball game.<br>\nThat’s when it happened. One of the most amazing moments in Super Bowl history.<br>\nThe Patriots were 64 yards from the end zone and were facing an 8-point deficit.<br>\nJust 2:28 was left in regulation, and the offense for New England was set. Shot gun formation – Brady set and ready to throw a bullet.<br>\nJulian Edelman was the intended receiver, but he was surrounded by three Falcons.<br>\nRobert Alford, the Falcons corner who picked off Brady in the first half, made what would have been one of the biggest ball deflections in his entire career. He hit the football as it was spiraling in the air, and it looked as if he had ruined the hopes of New England, all with a bat of the ball.<br>\nBut Alford didn’t pick the ball this time, he just deflected it in the air; the ball was still in play and fair game to be caught.<br>\nRegardless of all the traffic, Edelman managed to make one of the most prodigious catches in Super Bowl history.<br>\nEdelman was able to grab the batted ball, put his hand under it, secure it and prevent it from touching the ground.<br>\nIn that very moment, I knew, and everyone watching knew, that the Patriots were going to come back and win this game.<br>\nThat catch set up the tying touchdown that eventually led to the first overtime period in Super Bowl history, and another Lombardi Trophy for New England.<br>\nThat 23-yard pass across the middle was the fairytale to end what was a rollercoaster season for the Patriots. From the Deflategate scandal to Brady’s resulting suspension, New England wanted this one bad – and that catch made sure it happened.<br>\nIn the words of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, this win was “unequivocally the sweetest.”</p>\n<p><strong>Party Like It’s 1985 by Andrew Bishop</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To football fans of the 21st century, the idea of the Chicago Bears blowing out the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl seems almost unheard of. However, at the end of the 1985 season in Super Bowl XX, the Monsters of the Midway bullied the Patriots to a 46-10 victory.<br>\nEvery Chicago Bears fan who was alive in 1985 remembers the Bears’ triumphant quest for the Lombardi Trophy, and even those like myself who were born after their victory grew up hearing tales of the famed team that won the Bears their first and only Super Bowl.<br>\nScholars of the game regard the ’85 Bears as being one of the greatest teams in the history of the NFL. Much like the Patriots of today, everyone was betting on the Bears to win in ’85. Led by legendary head coach Mike Ditka, the Bears’ defense terrorized opposing teams in ways nobody had ever seen before, and their offense was carried almost singlehandedly by the immortal Walter Payton, the greatest professional running back of all time.<br>\nThroughout the season, the Bears dominated on the field, going 15-1 and leading the league on defense, and off the field, where Bears players recorded a Grammy-nominated hit single that raised over $300,000 for Chicago charities. Unlike the Patriots, who are viewed as the proverbial “bad guys” of the NFL, the ’85 Bears were lovable and dominant, and America couldn’t get enough of them.<br>\nThere were many great moments throughout the Bears’ season, Grammy nomination included, but the most memorable moment of all came in the third quarter of Super Bowl XX. Following a fumble recovery by Bears linebacker Wilber Marshall, the Bears managed to march down to the Patriots 1-yard line, where they employed their secret weapon: William Perry, a 6’2”, 350-pound defensive tackle-turned running back.<br>\nPerry, better known by his endearing nickname “The Fridge,” was one of the largest players to ever set foot on a professional football field, and Coach Ditka had the brilliant idea to give this monstrous human being the ball on the goal line. Outweighing nearly every opposing defender by over 100 pounds, the Fridge took the handoff and plowed through the line like a bowling ball, stumbling into the end zone for a touchdown.<br>\nThe nation erupted in collective laughter as the athletic giant ran over his opposition and capped his score off with a ball spike that puts Rob Gronkowski’s to shame. Despite lasting no more than a few seconds, that goal line play is remembered by football fans throughout the nation for all of eternity.<br>\nThe ’85 Bears are worshipped by fans throughout the nation, and reruns of the Patriots’ demolition in Super Bowl XX still play in American households to this day. It was an undeniably memorable season, which was capped off in spectacular fashion with a touchdown scored by a man the size of a refrigerator.</p>\n<p><strong>PATS INT SAVES THE DAY by Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a little difficult for me to pick just one Super Bowl moment in particular as my favorite.<br>\nI’m a Patriots fan, see, which means that not only am I incredibly obnoxious, but I also have a lot of good moments to choose from.<br>\nThe Adam Vinatieri field goals are pretty good, if a little fuzzy, and the whole fourth quarter against the Falcons was pretty amazing.<br>\nThe top spot, however, is reserved for the Malcolm Butler interception to win Super Bowl XLIX.<br>\nI was a junior in high school, only just starting to worry about getting into college.<br>\nI was actually enrolled in an SAT prep class that met on Sunday nights, even on Sunday nights that happened to be the Super Bowl.<br>\nI started the game off at a friend’s house, but I went back home to be with my mostly Patriot-supporting family after a tough third quarter put New England behind 24-14.<br>\nMy friends all hated the Patriots, rightfully so, and I wanted to be in a friendlier environment.<br>\nI could barely remember the Patriots’ three Super Bowl wins but I could definitely remember the two losses, and I wasn’t looking forward to a repeat of that feeling.<br>\nAs the Seahawks drove into Patriot territory late in the game, however, it looked as though that was what I was in for.<br>\nThe insane Jermaine Kearse catch, where he managed to catch a deflected pass by kicking it to himself while lying flat on his back, just reinforced my sense of doom.<br>\nThe Seahawks inched closer to the end zone, and I started resigning myself to a depressing SAT class.<br>\nThen Malcolm Butler undercut Kearse’s slant at the goal line and intercepted the ball with 20 seconds left in the game.<br>\nI went nuts, running around the house while my dad just stood there in disbelief.<br>\nThe feeling just got better as the Patriots ran down the clock and my family continued to celebrate. Then I immediately got in my car and drove to my class, blasting music and singing the whole way.<br>\nIt was the first Super Bowl win I was really conscious for, and it was amazing.<br>\nBeing at home made it even more special, pushing it over the top in my memory banks.<br>\nIf all goes right, I’ll have another good memory after Sunday, but it’s hard to see anything topping that interception.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Feb. 1</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/","id":3388,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[3387,3386,3385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hopping Off: HOPR Bike Program Decides to Leave Campus","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/42203283_2185379075065242_7245552554963107840_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/42203283_2185379075065242_7245552554963107840_n.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The bike share service arrived in the area a little over a year ago in early September, after partnering with UCSB for a three-year contract.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOPR Bike Share, a bicycle rental service that has operated on the UC Santa Barbara campus and in Isla Vista since September 2018, has ended its contract with the university and plans to leave during spring break of this year.</span></p>\n<div style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42203283_2185379075065242_7245552554963107840_n.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although HOPR was not considered a problem, revenue from riders was not sufficient to cover costs. </span><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bike share service </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/hopping-into-the-new-school-year-hopr-bike-share-has-arrived/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrived </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the area</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a little over a year ago in early September, after partnering with UCSB for a three-year contract. However, the contract allowed HOPR to cancel at any time, as long as it gives the university 60-day notice, according to Chelsea Davidoff, a HOPR representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main challenge was economic, ridership revenue is not enough to pay the bills. This is true for most transit modes,” Davidoff said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although HOPR’s ridership was not considered a problem, revenue from riders was not sufficient enough to cover operating costs, according to James Wagner, program manager for the Transportation Alternatives Program (T.A.P.) at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most bicycle-share programs on college campuses need subsidies to survive and keep their rates affordable to customers, due to the expensive cost of buying and maintaining shared bicycles, Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The HOPR contract contemplated securing a sponsor but since they didn’t get one, the program was not economically feasible. As such they requested to cancel the contract,” Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB T.A.P. plans to replace HOPR’s service with another bicycle rental company, </span><a href=\"https://www.bcycle.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BCycle</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the future, Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation &amp; Parking Services currently does not have room in its budget to front the cost for a bicycle-share program, Wagner said. HOPR did not initially ask for a subsidy because it expected to secure a sponsor, which is why it was contracted, Davidoff added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“HOPR provided an option to the University to sponsor or subsidize the program as part of the transportation budget, but this budget was not available,” Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We may open another request for proposals (RFP) to see if other bicycle share vendors are willing to provide bicycle share at no cost to the university besides user fees,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recognized as a Platinum-level Bicycle Friendly University by the League of American Bicyclists</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Part of this recognition is due to the large number of bicycles available to share on campus through HOPR, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOPR remains in other cities and universities throughout the country where it has found more economic success, such as UC Los Angeles, the University of South Florida and the cities of Santa Monica, Atlanta and Orlando, according to Davidoff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidoff said that despite the early contract termination, HOPR leaves UCSB thankful for the opportunity from the university and support from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope they find a budget for bike share, students love it, it is affordable, healthy, fun and environmentally friendly. If there is a will, there’s always a way,” Davidoff said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years. <em>Channing Mink / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million upgrade from 10 to 100 gigabit links is set to be completed in April, but buildings such as the University Library could see immediate improvements in data transmission speed, according to Kevin Schmidt, UCSB’s director of Enterprise Technology Services, who is in charge of the router replacement project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Schmidt said that there will not be a very noticeable immediate impact on internet speeds in most other parts of campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the previous router installation was in 2010, the rapid progression of technology in the past decade has increased demand for larger data usage, according to Schmidt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The center part of our network … is operating at speeds that were fine for its day, but the aggregate demand that we have is large enough that in order to support the future of this campus’ teaching research and community service mission, we must upgrade this,” Schmidt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years, according to Schmidt, at which point they will have to be upgraded again.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million used for the project includes the cost of the routers, labor for installation and maintenance for over the next seven years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB data network will be down during the router installation from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on the following Wednesdays: Feb. 26, March 4, April 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By increasing the capacity of the data network, Schmidt said the data transmission speed at individual buildings can then be improved. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If data speeds in specific buildings were increased without building more data capacity, it would be like making “really big roads that lead right into a two-lane highway,” Schmidt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do first is make the highway bigger, and then we’ll make the streets out to the residential neighborhoods larger,” Schmidt added, referring to various other buildings on campus as the “residential neighborhoods.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the time span for replacing the new routers is listed as three hours, the actual installations could be as short at 15 minutes, decreasing the amount of time the network is down, according to Schmidt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An upgraded network could also facilitate easier use of multimedia teaching materials, such as video, according to Rich Wolski, a professor in the computer science department at UCSB. Video uses such a large amount of data relative to other internet uses that the campus will “overwhelmingly” notice the upgrade in the form of faster video loading speeds, he added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you were to go to another research school, you would expect 10 gigabit networking to be present, you might not expect 100 [gigabits],” Wolski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond internet usage, data transmissions on campus can typically be from researchers downloading information from NASA satellites, according to Schmidt. Information downloaded can include weather patterns and ocean temperatures over periods of time.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step in the project is to evaluate the data connections between the central network and the service in individual buildings, according to Schmidt. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We fixed the highway that brings us into the city, and then we need to look at those roads that lead off the highway into the neighborhoods,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92754\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92754\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/2-7-million-new-router-installation-to-improve-data-capacity-and-internet-speed-making-way-at-ucsb/","id":3390,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[3389,3388,3387],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
