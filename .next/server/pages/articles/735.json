Although she averages 13.7 points per game (fifth in the Big West), McCalister scored 21 points in the first matchup and then single-handedly destroyed the Gauchos in Irvine when she scored a career-high 36 points.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great player and she made a lot of tough shots [on] senior night,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully we can do some different things to slow her down. It will be a team effort.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB can uphold its league-leading, tenacious defense that allows teams just 50.9 points per game, it will certainly have a shot at a win because Irvine’s strategy is simple: outscore its opponent. UCSB gave up a season-worst 72 points in the last matchup.</p>\n<p>“They’re extremely athletic, and we had a lot of mistakes in the last game,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully if we can cut down on the turnovers and do the little things, we can [go] out on the road and get a win.”</p>\n<p>In both games, the Anteaters found a weakness in the Gaucho defense, taking advantage behind the three-point arc. Against the Gauchos this season, the Anteaters shot an incredible 50.5 percent from downtown.</p>\n<p>“We have to come out like we did [Saturday] and feel like we have nothing to lose,” senior forward Kelsey Adrian said. “We have to put it all out there and just fight. We know what kind of team we are.”</p>\n<p>After that great win at UC Davis, there was only one key to continuing the momentum, according to senior guard Emilie Johnson: “Consistency … that’s all I have to say.”</p>\n<p>That might sound like a cliché, but inconsistency has been a big issue for the Gauchos. Before the win at Davis, UCSB had a poor performance against Pacific. Nevertheless, the team enters the Big West tournament having won six of their last eight games.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we feel confident after the game at Davis,” Mitchell said. “My goal was to have our team peaking at the right time, and I’m confident we’re playing to the best of our abilities.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Johnson leads the team, averaging 9.4 points per game. If UCSB wants to prolong their season, other players are going to have to step up. Adrian comes off a tremendous performance at Davis, where she tallied a career-high 21 points and drained four threes, and junior forward Kirsten Tilleman, who has played well in both games against Irvine, averages 13 points and eight boards. Both players will be huge in giving the Gauchos an inside presence.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/","id":735,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[734,733,732],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Two-Game Road Trip Begins at Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s basketball finishes their regular season with a crucial road trip north to Pacific Thursday and UC Davis Saturday, which will ultimately determine if the Gauchos receive a home playoff ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s basketball finishes their regular season with a crucial road trip north to Pacific <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Untitled-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Thursday and UC Davis Saturday, which will ultimately determine if the Gauchos receive a home playoff game in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB currently sits in sixth place in the Big West standings with an overall record of 13-14 and 7-7 in conference.

The game at home was a nail biter throughout until an 8-0 run by the Tigers down the stretch clinched the win.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re a very different team,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We’re getting points from the inside, so there’s a lot more balance than there was in the beginning of the season.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos will look to their leading scorer, senior guard Emilie Johnson, UCSB has plenty of options, including sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit, who led the team offensively in the last matchup against UOP with 10 points. Also, in the last six games, junior center Kristen Tilleman has provided a presence inside, averaging 10.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing a lot smoother on the offensive end of things,” Mitchell said. “We did a decent job against them defensively [last time], but at that time, we were really struggling offensively. If we can find a flow early, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos will continue to rely on their league leading defense. On average, UCSB holds its opponents to 35.6 percent shooting and 51.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ defense will square off against Pacific’s potent offense, which ranks second in the Big West in scoring at about 70 points per game. The Tigers also rank second in three point shooting field goals per game, averaging 5.7. UCSB will need to get its hands up, since this is an area that opponents have successfully taken advantage of all year.</p>\n<p>Pacific’s offense is also very balanced. They feature two of the top nine scorers in the Big West in junior forward Kendall Rodriguez and junior guard Erica McKenzie.</p>\n<p>“We play everyone straight up man,” Mitchell said. “We’ll probably look at different people guarding players that hurt us last game, but that’ll be the only adjustment we make.”</p>\n<p>The two teams contain three of the top rebounders in conference — Rodriguez for Pacific and Tilleman and Underwood for the Gauchos. Last time, the Tigers won the rebounding battle 39-31, despite Tilleman’s 12 boards.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets and Tilleman] typically take care of their job on the rebounding side, but we’ll need players like Destini Mason and Kelsey Adrian and other guards getting the long rebounds because they shoot a lot of threes,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Alex G. Spanos Center.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45156\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45156\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/","id":732,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[731,730,729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Freshmen Pair Makes Big Impact For UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With one of the most heralded senior classes in the history of the UCSB men’s basketball team set to finish off its college career, two Gaucho freshmen have been making an unexpected and immediate i...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BBALL-v-Pacific-3.1.12_Jake-Collins-2.jpg?resize=213%2C267\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"267\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">With one of the most heralded senior classes in the history of the UCSB men’s basketball team set to finish off its college career, two Gaucho freshmen have been making an unexpected and immediate impact on this veteran-laden squad. With UCSB’s final game of the season this Saturday and the Big West postseason tournament next week, both center Alan “Big Al” Williams and point guard T.J. Taylor will have a major say in whether UCSB can make it back to the Big Dance for a third consecutive season.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun being the two young guys getting the minutes on the team,” Williams said. “In preseason and stuff we were saying that we wanted to start, and we knew that if we kept working hard it could happen.”</p>\n<p>Entering the school year last summer, both Williams and Taylor expected they would be watching most games wearing street clothes as redshirt freshmen.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Coming in, we both thought we would have to redshirt,” Taylor said. “Then a couple of guys got hurt or whatever, and we both got the opportunity to play more.”</p>\n<p>Both freshmen have taken advantage of the opportunity, running with it all the way to starting jobs. Williams has started 14 of 24 games overall for the Gauchos, including 13 of 14 in conference play. Taylor has started nine games overall for UCSB, including eight in conference.</p>\n<p>“Al and T.J. have really both created their own opportunities by playing well when given the chance,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Especially Al; every time he played he was productive and his minutes just got extended as he carved out a niche for himself.”</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that anyone who has seen a UCSB game this season knows Williams’ niche is rebounding the basketball. The 6’7” big man is currently averaging 8.2 rebounds per game in conference play, good for third in the Big West. His 1.9 blocks per game also rank third in the Big West. Impressively, Williams has more offensive rebounds on the season, a statistic in which he ranks first place in the league, than defensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I know my biggest impact is rebounding the ball,” Williams said. “It takes pressure off my guards knowing they can put up shots and I’m under the basket rebounding … I just try to go after it and get it done — it’s fun to work hard.” <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/T.J.-Taylor-vs-UNLV_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=307%2C220\" alt=\"\" width=\"307\" height=\"220\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>“It is invaluable to know your role as a player,” coach Williams said. “The key to being successful, whether you are a player on a team or in a corporation, is that you see what you can bring to the table. … Al sees what he brings, he does what he is best at and he is excited about doing it every day.”</p>\n<p>Big Al has become a fan favorite this season, as the Gaucho Locos’ cheers often reach their loudest after Williams blocks a shot, grabs an offensive rebound or dives for a loose ball.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of fun to go out there and try to bring as much energy as possible,” Williams said. “Our fans are loud and supportive … we do it for them, we represent this whole campus and school, it feels good that they are supporting us.”</p>\n<p>Standing at 5’9”, Taylor is the lightning to Williams’ thunder. Often the smallest guy on the court, Taylor makes up for his lack of size with exceptional speed and fearlessness.</p>\n<p>“He has got great quickness and is a natural leader,” coach Williams said. “He has this natural charisma about him that is just contagious.”</p>\n<p>As a young point guard often asked to run a veteran-laden team, the responsibility of being a leader is magnified. Taylor, who ranks fifth on the team in minutes and third in assist-to-turnover ratio in conference, is accepting and embracing the challenge with an eye toward the future.</p>\n<p>“If I can become a good leader for this team with a veteran group, it will help me in the future,” Taylor said. “I would like to work on becoming more vocal, more fearless and just fully taking advantage of the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The recruiting experiences for Williams and Taylor were not alike, as different circumstances in the past few years eventually brought the pair to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Williams played high school basketball in Phoenix, Arizona, and was not highly recruited out of high school despite winning two state championships in his sophomore and junior seasons.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really start getting recruited until the summer between my junior year and senior year,” Williams said. “That was the last recruiting period so I guess you could say I was a late bloomer.”</p>\n<p>Initially unsure of whether Williams was a good fit for UCSB, coach Williams decided to make an offer after attending a tournament to watch him play.</p>\n<p>“Watching him in a tournament in Arizona, I remember a specific play where he was running the length of the floor at full speed,” coach Williams recalled. “He picks up a ball thrown at his ankles in a dead sprint and finished with a finger roll right over the rim … a guy with that kind of ability for a big man is just rare.”</p>\n<p>Taylor’s path to UCSB began differently. Out of Oakland, Taylor had originally committed to Santa Clara as a sophomore before later deciding to reopen his recruiting. That is when coach Williams swooped in.</p>\n<p>“I liked T.J., but I fell in love with the kid when it came down to the in-home visit,” coach Williams said. “When I went in the home and got to know his family and his mother and grandmother, I fell in love with the kid. I walked out of the home and said I would really love to have him — he would be a great fit for our program.”</p>\n<p>As this year’s squad looks to close out its season with a Big West championship and trip to the NCAA Tournament, Williams and Taylor understand that their impact at UCSB will be felt for years to come.</p>\n<p>“It only gets better,” Taylor said. “We don’t plan on having any dip in the program in the future. We will be coming strong here for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>“We will be the sophomore veterans next year,” Williams added.</p>\n<p>A bit of an oxymoron, but that is quite possibly the truth. As the only two regular starters returning to a team that will lose five seniors to graduation, much of the leadership roles will fall on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>“That’s why it’s good for us to be out there getting the experience,” Taylor said. “To set the tone for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>While excited and optimistic about the program’s future, coach Williams remains reserved with his expectations.</p>\n<p>“They have some big shoes to fill,” coach Williams said. “They still have a lot to prove. … However, I love the fact that they are excited about it and I do think this freshman class has a chance to be as great as our graduating senior class right now.”</p>\n<p>The immediate future will allow both Williams and Taylor to make a difference in the Gauchos’ postseason run this season, but the freshman duo will have three more years to make a lasting impact on the UCSB men’s basketball program.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/","id":733,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[732,731,730],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Secures No. 6 Spot With Win vs. Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Behind the effort of senior guard Kelsey Adrian, the UCSB women’s basketball team outlasted UC Davis 60-56 on the road in its final game of the regular season, breaking a six-game win streak by UC D...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DWade-Bball-V-CSUB-14.jpg?resize=187%2C283\" alt=\"\" width=\"187\" height=\"283\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Behind the effort of senior guard Kelsey Adrian, the UCSB women’s basketball team outlasted UC Davis 60-56 on the road in its final game of the regular season, breaking a six-game win streak by UC Davis over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It was just a great senior effort by [Kelsey],” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We put her on the baseline knowing that’s where a lot of the open shots would come from, and she made them when it counted.”</p>\n<p>Adrian scored a career-high 21 points on 7-of-13 shooting to improve the Gauchos to 8-8 in the Big West and 14-15 overall, marking the 22nd consecutive season UC Santa Barbara has finished .500 or better in conference.

It felt really good going in.”</p>\n<p>UCSB took a 10-point lead into halftime, holding Davis to 22 points. Davis was held scoreless for over five minutes to start the game, and while the Aggies made critical threes down the stretch, they were kept in check in the first half, shooting 22.2 percent.</p>\n<p>“Going in, we knew that they were three-point shooters and that they like to drive and get all the way to the rim for lay-ups,” Mitchell said. “If you make someone pull up and take a jumper, then we were getting what we wanted out of this game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB tried to put the game away in the second half, but the Aggies continued to hang around, and an offensive dry spell down the stretch allowed Davis back into the mix.</p>\n<p>“Davis is a great team and we expected them to make a run,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “This [was] their senior night and their final home game, so we just wanted to stay composed. We had to play to win.”</p>\n<p>The defense was solid for the Gauchos, who made critical stops down the stretch to ensure it didn’t become a one-possession game.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB shot a sizzling 47.6 percent from the field, including 46.7 percent from downtown. The Gauchos had three players in double figures as well. Besides Adrian, Johnson contributed 13 points and five assists while Tilleman tallied 11 points and nine boards.</p>\n<p>“We made shots and our shot selection was great,” Mitchell said. “Emilie ran the show for 40 minutes and Tilleman got the big boards.”</p>\n<p>With the win, UCSB secured the sixth seed in the Big West and will head south to play third seed UC Irvine Tuesday in the opening round of the Big West Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45253\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45253\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-05/ucsb-secures-6-spot-win-davis/","id":734,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[733,732,731],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
