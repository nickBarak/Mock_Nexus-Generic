Headlining the sold-out show was alternative EDM group Rüfüs Du Sol, accompanied by opening act, SG Lewis. Fresh off the release of their third album, <em>Solace</em>, Rüfüs Du Sol delivered an exciting performance in which fans of all ages could dance and let loose at this stop in their current world tour.</p>\n<p>Opening the show was DJ, producer, songwriter and fellow EDM artist SG Lewis. Name sound familiar? Though he spent the night performing before Rüfüs Du Sol at the Bowl, Lewis has previously performed at The Hub on campus here at UCSB two fall seasons ago.</p>\n<p>Originally from Britain, Lewis has begun to leave his mark in the United States with his moody yet dance-oriented remix tracks that blend quite well with the sometimes depressing yet also fun atmosphere of college. Like many other rising musicians in the age of the internet, Lewis began his music career by posting remixes and songs online until a loyal fan base was eventually established. After gaining some attention in 2014 for his remix of “You &amp; I (Forever)” by Jessie Ware, Lewis was quickly signed to the British label PMR Records and has continued to grow since then.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As the music began to pour out of the speakers at the beginning of the night, SG Lewis stood behind his keyboard and entranced early concert-goers to the front of the stage. Though originally a solo act, Lewis was accompanied by a live band and female vocalist who performed alongside him.</p>\n<p>While most people were just arriving or getting settled into their seats, Lewis provided a sound that was suitable for both those who wanted to sit and chill before Rüfüs and those who wanted to start dancing already. Performing new songs like “Throwaway,” which features indie-pop singer Clairo; “Hurting”; and “Aura” with a live band, Lewis reminded local Santa Barbarans exactly how much dedication he puts into producing and playing his tracks.</p>\n<p>Once the sun set and SG Lewis finished his performance, the Santa Barbara Bowl became noticeably more crowded than before as anticipation for Rüfüs Du Sol continued to grow. Now almost in the 10th year of their career, Rüfüs Du Sol was first formed in 2010 by members Tyrone Lindqvist, Jon George and James Hunt. Although the trio is most famous in their home of Australia, with their debut album <em>Atlas</em> reaching the No. 1 spot on the Australian Albums Chart in 2013, Rüfüs Du Sol has since expanded their popularity all over the world. Since their debut, Rüfüs has performed in several international music festivals like the NSW Bluesfest at Byron Bay, Electric Forest Festival, Mountain Sounds Festival and even at Coachella on three separate occasions, including this year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87722\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1056401932\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87688\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87722\" data-attachment-id=\"87722\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-24/rufus-du-sol-comes-to-sb-ahead-of-sunny-coachella-set/rufus-du-sol_ida-kazerani_online-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=2000%2C1185&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1185\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Rufus Du Sol_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE (6)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=888%2C526&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87722\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=888%2C526\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=768%2C455&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rufus-Du-Sol_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87722\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Finally, after a brief intermission, all the lights went black, and Rüfüs Du Sol took the stage. With flashing red lights synchronized to the beat of an unusually long introduction to their song “Eyes,” cheers from the crowd began to erupt once they recognized the familiar tune. From left to right was Jon George on keyboard, Tyrone Lindqvist on lead vocals and guitar and finally James Hunt on drums. Though originally performing songs from the electronic dance genre of music, like SG Lewis, Rüfüs performed with a complete band setup, leading to a more captivating performance than just a static DJ set. With all three members dressed in black from head to toe, Rüfüs Du Sol made it clear they’re more dedicated to the art of creating music rather than for the showiness of being famous musicians.</p>\n<p>The night continued to unravel without a hitch as mysterious clouds of smoke hovered over the standing general admission area on this special April 20 evening of music. While everyone seemed to be having fun throughout each song, it was quite clear which songs of Rüfüs Du Sol’s were fan favorites. With the album release of <em>Solace </em>in late 2018, they have since become smitten with the new tracks “Underwater,” “No Place” and “Treat You Better,” all of which have recently made it onto U.S. Billboard Charts, unlike their previous singles.</p>\n<p>In addition to playing these recent hits, Rüfüs performed older songs as well, like “Say a Prayer,” in which singer Lindqvist decided to abandon the stage and instead occupy a tall speaker located directly in front of the audience. It was during this moment that the loving relationship between artist and fan was most apparent, displaying to everyone at the Bowl just how appreciative Rüfüs is for their fame, success and support.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the show, lead singer Lindqvist addressed the audience and described the special place Santa Barbara has in their hearts. “This was the first city that we came to in the United States,” Lindqvist said.</p>\n<p>“We’re from Australia. We made the big trip over here when I was about 21, and we visited a friend that was in college and had the best time here. We’ve got two beautiful days in this city; we’re going to enjoy it, and if you see us around say hello to us,” he concluded, continuing on with the illuminating night of music.</p><div

Chilling, lustful and brilliantly original, “Trilogy” put the Toronto native on the map as the genre’s resident envelope-pusher. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the bar was set too high right away, but it has taken The Weeknd a few years to navigate the waters of defying mainstream tropes. At one point, illusioned with the idea of making music in Los Angeles, he affirmed that “Cali is the mission/Visit every month like I’m split life living” on his track “The Morning.” A series of astounding career accomplishments (</span><a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/8/the-weeknd-rocks-the-guinness-world-records-2017-edition-with-two-new-titles-441468?fb_comment_id=1256847907667751_1259646137387928\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">including having the most streamed album on Spotify in one year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and career missteps (2016’s uninventive “Starboy”) has now led him to this point: The Weeknd has returned, once again cynical and jaded, and so very close to regaining the glory of his “Trilogy” days. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the strongest tracks on “After Hours” is also the album opener, “Alone Again.” The haunting melody immediately evokes the forsaken nostalgia of the “Trilogy” era as The Weeknd finds himself in the same position he started out in: far from sober and alone again. The album shows off its artistic cohesiveness over the next several tracks as the Lothario continues to lament over how he is a lost cause when it comes to any sort of romantic relationship, and how the only lifestyle he is familiar with is one that involves substances and vapid sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first half of the album serves as a sort of restitution for fans who have long been looking for the sonically spectral trademark of The Weeknd’s earlier discography. The second half of the album kicks off with the dazzling synth explosion that is “Blinding Lights.” The feverish, ‘80s disco-esque track is by far the album’s most infectious song. “In Your Eyes,” complete with an immaculate saxophone moment, stands out as the most promising chart-topper as The Weeknd taps into a rarely seen vulnerable side: “I always look the other way/I’m blind, I’m blind/In your eyes, you lie, but I don’t let it define you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After Hours” proves that at his core, The Weeknd still gives in to his baser instincts, even if he has grown up over the years. “Light a blunt up with the flame/Put that cocaine on a plate/Molly with the purple rain/‘Cause I lost my faith,” he broods over a dark, Metro Boomin-produced trap beat as he admits to himself that drugs are still his favorite vice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weeknd has spent the past decade having each of his projects picked apart and held up against his visionary first mixtape. With “After Hours,” he makes it clear that he deserves the chance to evolve with his sound — but that he also deserves the benefit of the doubt. These days, when any music he releases is guaranteed a Top 100 debut, it may be time to accept that “Trilogy” just had that certain “je ne sais quoi” that is not meant to be replicated. With this latest album, new listeners can revel in a melancholic sound that they may not be familiar with yet, and long-time fans can take comfort in the fact that The Weeknd has not really lost sight of who he is after all. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">364 out of 365 days of the year we sit around with normal heart rates and high spirits, but </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when Halloween rolls around, we </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are cruelly reminded of how terrifying the world can be. Sure, being scared is … well, scary, but the feeling you get from spooking unsuspecting victims is just oh-so-satisfying. Whether you’re popping out from behind a door or devising an elaborate scheme of haunts, we can all agree that Halloween is a hell of a lot of fun. Scaring kids is funny, and scaring teens is downright hilarious, but scaring parents is a type of sickening gratification that gives anyone who has experienced it a peculiar sense of pride. But just how do you scare a parent, someone that has truly experienced all of the abominations of this world? Don’t rack your brain for answers because that is exactly what we’re here for — the answer is simply modern-day music. Explicit language, detestable imagery and ear-piercing beats will surely make any reasonable adult’s skin crawl. Here are some of the best songs for you to blast on your speaker to give your parents a good fright this Halloween:</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">1. “My Neck, My Back (Lick It)” by Khia</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re starting off strong with this 2003 classic. Khia’s downright dirty anthem is so bad that it’s good. Although the lyrics are strongly suggestive, the beat is fantastic and is perfect for any party playlist regardless of theme or holiday.

While these lyrics are more subtly put, the meaning is one you better hope your parents don’t ask for. All these innuendos will have them running for the hills. This fright is a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decent 7/10.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">3. “Make It Nasty” by Tyga</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents will only use the word “nasty” to describe two things: your boogers and this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">song. Tastefully simple and popular for over a decade now, Tyga graces clubs, bars and teenage girls’ iPhones with this unsavory hit. But while the masses are getting down, parents across the nation are hiding their daughters from the terrors of this song. Perhaps Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz” described it best: “Lions and Tygas and bears, oh my!”</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">4. “Lollipop” by Lil Wayne ft.

Because the second they realize that the song is not in fact about candy and is instead explicitly detailing girls performing sexual acts on Lil Wayne, you’re so screwed. However, the song is a clever innuendo on Lil Wayne’s part (although my parents definitely didn’t agree).</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">5. “Deepthroat” by cupcakKe</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t need to listen to more than 25 seconds of this song to know it will scare the shit out of your grandparents, sisters, brothers, cousins, dogs and maybe even you. I assure you, every single line in this song will scare the shit out of your parents. And cupcakKe doesn’t stop at vulgar descriptive lyrics; she includes sexual adlibs throughout the whole song so you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> understand the message.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">6. “Or Nah (Remix)” by Ty Dolla $ign ft.

I arrived exactly at 7 p.m., the time allotted for the opening act, and was serenaded to my seat by Perfume Genius’s opening few songs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perfume Genius opening for Bon Iver hailed as a true gift. Genius moved like a snake; he slid across the stage with ease and experimented with sensual dance moves that garnered a laugh from the crowd. At times he came into a complete squat while singing, melting down with the beat of his music. Complementing his charismatic dancing, his suave voice pierced throughout the Bowl carrying a smooth resonance; spontaneously, he threw in a few penetrating shrieks, naturally on key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was able to appreciate his talent much more as I had researched his background a couple nights before. An interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Yorker</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reveals that growing up, Perfume Genius, formerly known as Mike Hadreas, was the only openly gay student at his high school. He struggled with self-identity issues alongside domestic abuse, which led to significant drug abuse as well. Though unjustifiable, his tough life experiences add a complex and dark layer to many of his songs. For an artist that I didn’t know until four days before the show, Perfume Genius definitely surpassed my expectations.    </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He sang delightfully for a total of 40 minutes then bluntly walked off the stage after performing “Queen,” without giving a real goodbye.

They began the set with the first song from their newest album, “22 (OVER S ∞ ∞ N).” I laughed at the fact that an artist would choose to begin a set, or an album for that matter, with a song that opposes the very idea of a beginning. With lyrics like, “It might be over soon,” the song serves as a very cryptic foreword to the set. “22 (OVER S ∞ ∞ N)” was followed by “10 Death Breast,” a song that seems indicative of falling apart. The visuals to this song flashed sporadically in the background and gave me an impression of puzzle pieces that could be put together. The lyrics of “10 Death Breast” themselves appear as fragmented ideas rather than a continuous thought.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83804\" style=\"width: 817px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1081717378\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83803\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83804\" data-attachment-id=\"83804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/bon-iver-graces-the-bowl-with-summertime-show/bon-iver/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?fit=807%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"807,454\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bon-iver\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?fit=807%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83804 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=807%2C454\" alt=\"\" width=\"807\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?w=807&amp;ssl=1 807w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bon-iver.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Consequence of Sound</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the first three songs, I felt disoriented and distorted. I began to forget the peaceful side of Bon Iver that lulled me to sleep many nights in a row. But the eerie and fragmented atmosphere was broken five songs through by “8 (circle).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“8 (circle)” began as refreshing: a soft and more divine song compared to those before. The visuals transitioned from rigid pieces, corresponding with previous songs, to a glowing fluid stream, pink and adorned with hearts. The song’s slow and airy nature moved into a grand quality of magnificence. This song may sound beautiful in its recorded version, but it was absolutely breathtaking live. I could not help but hypothesize that “8 (circle)” represents growth, a transition from a fragmented soul to one that is whole again. Chills ran down my arms as I sat and watched a dark, electronic mood shift completely to one of growth and power. I’ve watched “8 (circle)” live on YouTube from his other performances and most of them pale in comparison to the raw energy of frontman Justin Vernon’s SB Bowl performance of the song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vernon took a break after this emotional song to introduce the band and then transitioned to “29 # Stratford APTS.” This song was complemented by a backdrop of five doors, which I assume represented choice and options. It became clear to me at this moment that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22, A Million</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tells a story, one of isolation and disintegration that evolves to one of growth and choice. Bon Iver told this story beautifully through their emotional and graceful set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They played “Blood Bank,” my favorite of their songs, with incredible passion and intensity. If I hadn’t known the song so well it would have been hard to recognize it immediately, since Vernon played it so much more powerfully live. The song is nuanced by the color red, with references to blood in bags as well as blood rushing to one’s cheeks. He played “Blood Bank” with a lot more energy and speed than is heard in the recorded version. His performance of the song was incredibly emotional and brought about a newer life to the song than I had ever felt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vernon paused in between his set to announce partnership with a non-profit, STESA, a Santa-Barbara-based organization advocating empowerment against and awareness of sexual assault. On the topic of sexual assault, Vernon spoke with conviction and wondered how people could be so horrible to other strangers they barely know. (You can get involved with STESA at </span><a href=\"http://sbstesa.org/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sbstesa.org</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bon Iver received a standing ovation that went on for a couple minutes, and, as might be expected, he came back out for an encore. Vernon ended his show with a solo acoustic performance of “Re: Stacks.” I was completely in awe by his concordant and lovely strumming during this piece, but I was even more astonished by his strong, high-pitched pipes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a chance to speak to UCSB third-year sociology major Dallin Mello after the show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He thought the show was amazing: “Bon Iver exemplified that his work isn’t just oriented around his voice, but also various other aspects that define him as a multifaceted artist.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His previous album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bon Iver</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was much more focused on a voice backed by instruments needled in between, whereas </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22, A Million</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> incorporated all kinds of synthesizers, intensified glass sounds and distorting effects. “Babys,” for example, integrated really clean glass noises that spun around the venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mello continued, “Tonight we saw his use of visuals as a way of creating motion and capturing attention throughout his performance.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His visuals completed the story that his music told as thought the backdrops were an instrument themselves, needled in the background of the song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara Bowl was an ideal venue to see Bon Iver perform and to spend my Wednesday night. I’d consider shelling out to see him again because playing his set list on Spotify does not compare at all to the talent, beauty and emotion of his live set.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.
