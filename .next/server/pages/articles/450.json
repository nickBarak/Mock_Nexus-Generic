Vincent’s scoring coupled with the energetic play of sophomore guard Hunter Ford helped Santa Barbara get back in the game.</p>\n<p>Ford, a walk-on who played a total of 16 minutes for the entire season prior to the game, was a much needed spark plug off the bench. Ford played 12 minutes and provided solid defense and rebounding, helping cut the lead to three after knocking down a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>“I think it was huge for him to come in and step in the way he did, and really spark us off the bench,” Williams said. “He’s a great shooter and I think that showed last night that [Head Coach Bob Williams] was able to put him in there and trust him.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally broke through with three straight three’s beginning with a Bryson shot that tied the game, followed by Vincent giving the Gauchos their first lead since the 14 minute mark of the first half. Bryson delivered the dagger with a minute left by draining an open three from the corner that put the Gauchos on top 46-42 and permanently gave the Gauchos the lead.</p>\n<p>“I think at that point we saw the momentum shifting and felt more in control, because at that point we had already gotten a couple stops defensively,” Bryson said. “You can tell [Cal Poly’s] demeanor was starting to fade. The momentum was starting to switch on our favor.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hung in after a slow start to begin the second half. An 8-0 run by Cal Poly in the first five minutes and a quick three fouls committed by Big Al increased the Mustangs’ lead and sent UCSB’s primary scorer to the bench. It was then that Santa Barbara opted for a rotation of shooters on the floor to knock down the three-point shots that helped it get back into the game.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs had the lead for a majority of the game by forcing the Gauchos to play out of sync. Cal Poly imposed its own style of play, controlling the tempo and turning the game into a slow-downed, physical affair.</p>\n<p>“Going into it we knew what kind of game it would be — a low scoring, grind-it out game,” Williams said. “I think we just really focused in and knew what we had to do in order to pull that game out.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly could have widened its 23-20 halftime lead, but the team shot only 25 percent in the first half to keep UCSB within striking distance, despite creating problems on defense.</p>\n<p>Vincent led all scorers with 15 points and junior forward Joel Awich led the Mustangs with 13. Bryson, who had a quiet first half, added eight points, all coming in the second half.</p>\n<p>“In the first half I was in some type of a rut, I owe a lot of that to the Cal Poly defense and them slowing us with that 1-3-1 [defense], which really threw me out of whack,” Bryson said. “My teammates stayed resilient and kept us in it, and put me in position in order to knock down big shots.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defended Big Al well, limiting him to only six points on seven attempts in the first half. It was not until later that Williams found his rhythm, especially on the block where he finished with 15 rebounds to go along with nine points.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for its first home conference game this Thursday when it takes on Cal State Northridge, and then travels to Long Beach State Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/","id":450,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[449,448,447],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host Big West Best UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=800%2C419&ssl=1","description":"With its four-game home winning streak on the line, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to hand the Big West's top team a loss before heading on the road.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Visiting the Thunderdome on a three-game winning streak, UC Davis sits atop the Big West with the league’s best overall and conference record of 16-6, 7-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB is coming off its best defensive performance of the season, in which it held Cal State Fullerton to a season-low 37 points. Most notably, the Gauchos’ bench was pivotal in their 20-point victory, outscoring the Titans 30-2 in bench points.</p>\n<p>Responsible for a tied game-high 14 of those bench points was redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Over the span of the Gauchos’ last five games, Toler has undoubtedly been the team’s flare off the bench on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court, especially during the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>During Big West play, Toler is second on the team in scoring with an 11.5 points per game average. She has tallied double-figures in five consecutive games and is shooting 54 percent over the span of games.</p>\n<p>Her ability to penetrate the paint and find open shooters continues to be beneficial as well as she is tied with her backcourt partner senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe for third in the Big West with a 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Often undersized when guarding in the backcourt, it is Toler’s quick hands and feet that have allowed her to be one of the team’s best on-ball defenders.</p>\n<p>Toler’s 1.9 steals per game average during conference play ranks second in the Big West. In 17 of UCSB’s 21 games this season, Toler has had at least one steal. As of recently, she has been a consistent bother on defense with three steals in three of the team’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Also providing consistency within the Gauchos’ starting lineup are both redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Alongside Toler, Edelman and Porter are the team’s other two double figure scorers during conference play. Porter averages a team leading 13 PPG, while Edelman is at 10.8, respectively. Edelman leads the Big West in field goal percentage at 57.4 percent.</p>\n<p>While UCSB will definitely need an improved first half start, opposite of its 17 points scored in its previous game, its on-ball pressure both inside the paint and along the perimeter will be most important in facing UC Davis.</p>\n<p>UC Davis plays at a patient, yet efficient pace which is most evident by their offense. Most importantly, the Aggies are structured with each possession as they are second in the conference with the least amount of turnovers per game at a 14.0 average.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, their care with the ball translates to their scoring as they lead the Big West with 70.6 PPG. The focal point to UC Davis’ offensive success is redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch.</p>\n<p>An All-Big West Second team and Big West All-Freshman team selection last season after being the program’s first freshman to lead the team in scoring since 1979-80 at 13.9 PPG, Bertsch is one of the league’s most productive frontcourt players.</p>\n<p>She ranks second in PPG and fourth in field goal percentage in the Big West with averages of 16.1 and 51.5, respectively. Bertsch owns a team-leading six 20-point games this season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ frontcourt star is a key factor in their conference leading 44.1 field goal percentage. Yet, also contributing is their 35.8 three-point percentage which also leads the Big West as well.</p>\n<p>Providing UC Davis with a perimeter threat is junior forward Pele Gianotti. She averages 10.3 PPG and is one of the Aggies’ most lethal shooters, making 37.6 percent of her three-pointers, ranking eighth in the conference.</p>\n<p>Despite Davis’ explosive offense, UCSB has the ability to keep up with the pace of the Aggies as the Gauchos are right behind them in both field goal percentage and three-point percentage at 41.3 and 35.1, respectively.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip-off this Saturday, Feb. 4 at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75462\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75462\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-04/gauchos-host-big-west-best-uc-davis/","id":447,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[446,445,444],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA PR: Harden’s Dirty Crossover, Warriors and Grizz Still On Top","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"How has the league been shaken up since a crazy trade deadline?

The Warriors had a brief absence of Bogut, but that was nowhere near enough to throw them off course with their other weapons. And don’t believe for a minute that Steph is actually hurt right now.</p>\n<p>Atlanta plays a style of ball that would succeed without some of their pieces, but luckily for them, that hasn’t presented itself yet.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Grizzlies missed out on Z-Bo for a long stint early on, but since his return they have looked nearly perfect. Conley has also been in and out of the lineup a bit, but even in their absence, they stayed with the Warriors on top of the tough Western Conference. This resilience from these teams keeps them atop the power rankings once again as the only squads with 40+ wins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1) Golden State Warriors (43-10, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​One of the reasons for this team’s ability to avoid injury this year is smart moves from Kerr such as his recent choice to sit Steph with his soreness. The team is opening up a six game road trip and although they got their 10<sup>th</sup> loss they will surely have a better chance in the next five with a rested MVP candidate. Best record in the NBA despite the ATL season-high win streak. That speaks volumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2) Memphis Grizzlies (41-14, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​They do say Defense wins championships. A Western Conference finals between these top two teams could be one for the ages and remind us all of the recent Seahawks v. Broncos Super Bowl. We all know how that turned out. The Grizzlies won both their games in this short week including last nights close battle with the Clippers. Holding Lob City to under 90 points is something to be proud of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3) Atlanta Hawks (44-12, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Rounding out the top three for the second straight week is this Hawks squad who has definitely cooled off from that streak that I mentioned earlier. Just 4-4 in the month of February due to some offensive troubles has people questioning the team’s depth and durability. This can’t be proven at the moment though, give them a chance to get out of the rut from the All-Star break.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4) Cleveland Cavaliers (35-22, +1)</strong></p>\n<p>​This team is seriously starting to look scary. Really any move that they could’ve made before the trade deadline would’ve benefited them, besides maybe sending away Lebron, but now they truly look like a deep and talented enough team to make a run in their first year together. The chemistry is building and it’s only going to go up from here. Toronto and Chicago, your spots are no longer safe. Good luck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5) Houston Rockets (38-18, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Their one spot drop isn’t on their behalf by any means; the Cav’s pickups were just too strong. I hate to move them down too, with James Harden playing like he is right now. The man is literally willing this team to every win and making a solid MVP case for himself along the way. Don’t forget this team (just Harden) is doing this all without Dwight Howard as well. When he gets back, the defense may be in good enough form to win a round or two.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6) Los Angeles Clippers (37-20, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Tough loss to the mighty defense of the Grizzlies without star Blake Griffin, but a couple W’s before that helped the pursuit to a higher seed. If they can outlast this hack-a-DJ phase or if DeAndre can just learn to shoot them, then they should be able to move up at least a spot or two.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7) Dallas Mavericks (38-20, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Amaré looked so good in his first minutes as a Maverick that I thought his jersey was orange and Nash was feeding him. This team has all the tools to compete and right now they could land anywhere between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 6<sup>th</sup> seeds and that’s not bad in the West but they will surely be playing some tough competition to start. They have a harsher schedule than most teams around their seeding ahead so home court advantage is going to take work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8) Toronto Raptors (37-19, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​This new starting lineup looks as good as the hype is treating it, but a loss to an AD-less Pelicans team is a tough one to swallow for The North. They’re one of few teams that has under 20 losses but when you look at their division, which they have a 13 game advantage over, it isn’t hard to tell why.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9) San Antonio Spurs (34-22, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Let’s just say that the last time I wrote this blog, this team had 34 wins… Taking losses from teams like the Jazz just isn’t going to cut and for once in this millennium, this mighty franchise may be showing some wear and tear. Kawhi isn’t providing the spark and the big 3 is settling down. 5-5 in their last ten games took a toll on them as they hang on to the seventh seed currently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10) Chicago Bulls (36-21, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The defense just hasn’t been there this year and how could you expect it when you add an offensive player like Gasol and Butler comes out of his shell? The team gets to play quite a few games in a row at home this week which would be nice except that they have a better road record. Derrick Rose needs to wake up from hibernation that started with his first injury and lead this team again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>11) Portland Trailblazers (36-19, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​With a struggling Nick Batum, the Blazers made a breakthrough pickup in trading for an offensive Aaron Afflalo. This without a doubt makes them a scarier team than they already were but if LA can’t stay in the game, we’ll know for sure that the team should’ve shut him down at the first sight of that injury.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>12) Oklahoma City Thunder (31-25, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Holding on to the eighth seed will not be as difficult of a task with a nearly brand new team that emerged post trade-deadline. Depth was an issue with this team and now the frontcourt has more potential than ever. Russell Westbrook has forgotten KD’s absence and is making a case for himself as the League’s most valuable player. When’s the last time two separate guys on the same team won back-to-backs?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>13) Milwaukee Bucks (31-25, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Bringing the defending ROY to your squad can never really hurt but we will have to see if the young guard spoils the chemistry or not, Knight was a perfect piece to this team but building for the future is never a bad thing to do, ask any team that is dominant now. Jabari Parker was a favorite for ROY this year before injury, they could have had back to backs. When’s the last time that happened either?</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><strong>14) Washington Wizards (33-23, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​A team riding a three game skid and has only won two games in the last ten. For those of you mathematicians out there, that means they have picked up over 33 percent of their losses just in those last 10 games alone. Playing without Beal has shown their soft spot and just like the Spurs, they have the same amount of wins as they did in last week’s rankings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>15) Phoenix Suns (29-28, -2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Yet another team to go winless in the past week. Can’t exactly blame them when trying to implement an entire new lineup after so many moves on deadline day. A team that was once overloaded with guards may have found a good mix in the Knight-Bledsoe duo. If they can get cooking, then the Thunder may have to actually start worrying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>16) Detroit Pistons (23-33, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of Reggie Jackson undoubtedly adds a necessary depth to this team’s backcourt and with the playoff race as tight as it is, this team now has a legitimate chance. They have the talent and the coaching, they just need to put the two together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>17) New Orleans Pelicans (29-27, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​The third team in the battle for the West’s eight seed does not look like a heavy contender if AD can’t get his body right. He tried to deliver what looked like a hit stick and ironically destroyed himself in the process, which is never a good sign. He and Ryan Anderson will be out for quite a bit so Tyreke will get the green light.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>18) Indiana Pacers (23-33, +2)</strong></p>\n<p>​Still on the rise winning seven of their last ten and their last three straight. A mixture of Stuckey and Hill has been a recipe for an unstoppable offense as they have sparked Indiana to a playoff team once again. By playoff team, I of course just mean that they have a seed. I wouldn’t exactly call them a playoff team just because of that. They have too much left to prove after this season’s start. PG return, come soon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>19) Boston Celtics (21-33, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of Isaiah Thomas was a big step forward and on the same day they took a big step back losing their best player Sully once again. Along with that IT is showing his old Kings style of play getting thrown out of his first Celtics-Lakers rivalry game. The combo of Smart and Thomas could be enough to snag an eighth seed but they have some catching up to do and without Sullinger it won’t be easy. Impressive win over Suns last night, but a loss to the Lakers? Really?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>20) Charlotte Hornets (22-32, -3)</strong></p>\n<p>​They and the Suns are tied for the biggest skid at the moment standing at five straight losses. Before hopping on this losing streak they held control of the seventh spot in the East and now have fallen to 11<sup>th</sup> behind Detroit and a hot Indiana. Mo Williams was supposed to be able to fill-in in Walker’s absence but this team can’t wait much longer for his return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>21) Brooklyn Nets (23-31, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​Maybe got a little confidence in their thrashing of the Nuggets last night but we will see how far that will carry them. They made a great move in swapping KG for Thad Young, which gives them a little more depth for the future. This team has been playing .500 basketball as of late but in the eighth spot, that may not cut it. Time for their many vets to get going.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>22) Utah Jazz (21-34, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​An impressive running through over the defending champions last night that followed an even more impressive win over the Blazers. The dealing of Enes Kanter allowed for Gobert to take more minutes and the defense looks better than ever since the trade. Defense is really what they lacked in so this is the most positive sign they’ve seen all year. The west may be too brutal for any luck this year though.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>23) Miami Heat (24-31, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>​The acquisition of the Dragic boys was the talk of the trade deadline but that happened just following it with Chris Bosh without a doubt has a bigger impact. I wish Bosh a speedy and efficient recovery but in the meantime Dragic and Hassan better figure out a way to keep a playoff seed. This point guard may be the best that D-Wade has ever had, but his success seems to be independent of that in his career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>24) Sacramento Kings (19-35, 0)</strong></p>\n<p>Only snagging three out their last ten games isn’t going to impress future Hall of Famer George Karl. Since arriving Karl has flipped the pace of the offense, which has now happened to this team a total of three times on the season. Give them a chance to get into the flow of things and maybe next year they’ll have another hot start; maybe one that they can stay on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>25) Orlando Magic (19-39, +3)</strong></p>\n<p>​A three game win streak says a lot about new interim head coach James Borrego and a 4-2 overall record is nothing to scoff at with the team he has adopted. Let’s just try not to focus on the fact that they beat the Sixers, Lakers, and Knicks and give him a round of applause.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>26) Minnesota Timberwolves (12-43, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Really? Kevin Garnett? Please don’t even try to lie and convince me that this was purely a basketball move, sending away a young kid with potential for the greatest player in that franchise’s history, who is older than some coaches and plays like it. I understand drawing fans and making money, but at least try to hide it better. I thought this was a building season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>27) Denver Nuggets (20-36, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​The most positive part about their trade deadline play was getting rid of some heavy contracts that frees up space for other players. The only question more interesting than what will happen to this team, is what will happen to our Gaucho Brian Shaw?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>28) Philadelphia 76ers (12-44, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Here I am thinking that MCW was the guard that they waited so long to get, but I guess I thought the same about Nerlens and Embiid  as well. MCW played one year, balled out, and got shipped out for some pieces that put this team in an interesting place. With McDaniels leaving as well, they fall back into the category where dumb fans will ask if they can even beat Kentucky.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>29) Los Angeles Lakers (14-41, +1)</strong></p>\n<p>​An overtime victory over the rival Celtics is enough to pull you out of last place in my eyes, without bias. But the team better watch out and not grab too many victories or they may be losing their top, and really only draft pick this year. Oh and by the way, they are pretty close to a franchise worst record. It’d be for the best to get it though.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>30) New York Knicks (10-45, -1)</strong></p>\n<p>​Hey nobody is in single digits, that’s something to celebrate. That’s about all one can celebrate with Melo being shut down for the rest of the season. With this record another upside is of course a possible first pick on the way to try and straighten out Melo’s team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61291\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61291\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/nba-pr-hardens-dirty-crossover-warriors-and-grizz-still-on-top/","id":448,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[447,446,445],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Open Season With Weekend Split","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s tennis team opened its regular season by splitting matches this past weekend, defeating Northern Arizona 5-0 on Sunday after losing a 4-3 heartbreaker to Santa Clara on Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team opened its regular season by splitting matches this past weekend, defeating Northern Arizona 5-0 on Sunday after losing a 4-3 heartbreaker to Santa Clara on Friday.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against the Broncos went down to the final match.
