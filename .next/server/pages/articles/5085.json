He has a standard order that consists of an agave latte, a cheese bagel with plain cream cheese and lemon pepper and a bottle of orange juice on occasion. He has a serious love for breakfast food in general, but he lists bagels as his absolute favorite and jokes about a period of time where that was all he ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>\n<p>During the interview, friends passing by bombard him with hellos. Like any UCSB athlete, Gronow is well-known in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>However, unlike many that might just return a simple, “Hello,” Gronow gives his full attention to each individual that approaches him. Not only was he participating in a detailed, one-on-one interview, but he was also making time for and expressing genuine interest in every conversation.</p>\n<p>This caring attitude comes as a result of striving to live out of honor for his dad.</p>\n<p>“When I was younger, it was embarrassing; he would strike up conversations with everyone,” Gronow said. “I didn’t realize it at the time, but now that I think about it, if I could have one trait about me from him, it would be the ability to be personable with everyone.”</p>\n<p>Gronow describes himself as always being a family man, but the recent passing of his dad gave a whole new meaning to the importance of loved ones.</p>\n<p>“With Dad passing away, something clicked in my mind … things can happen,” said Gronow.</p>\n<p>He explained that most people have been surprised by his ability to talk so openly and honestly about the situation, but he credits his amazing support system for this newfound strength.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara, Gronow is constantly surrounded by his teammates, whom he describes as being the best distraction from the situation. When Head Coach Wolf Wigo first broke the news to the team, Gronow remembers his phone lighting up for hours with text messages and calls from all of his teammates and their family members.</p>\n<p>“I will never forget these guys; they are definitely family,” said Gronow. “It sounds weird, but I know their smells … I could tell you a million things about each of them.”</p>\n<p>Back home in Australia, Gronow’s support comes from his immediate family. He describes his older siblings Chris and Ali and his mom as being the biggest influences on the person he is today.</p>\n<p>Gronow grew up in Essendon, Australia, a suburban neighborhood just outside of Melbourne. He spent his younger days shadowing his older brother Chris and constantly seeking advice from his sister Ali. When asked about his mom he says flat out, “My mum is crazy.” After a brief pause, he laughs and admits to being a total momma’s boy.</p>\n<p>When he was younger, he never shared the common childhood ideal of becoming a firefighter or an astronaut, but instead has always dreamed of standing atop a podium, medal in hand, representing his country as an Olympian.</p>\n<p>“Pretty much everything about his game has improved,” Wigo said. “He has put himself in a position where that is definitely a reality in the future if he chooses that path.”</p>\n<p>After an early morning of practice and breakfast at Cajé, Gronow heads across the street to his job at Embarcadero Hall. He works in a small office off the main lecture hall where he assists professors in prepping their power points and setting up their microphones.</p>\n<p>After a short two-hour shift, it’s back to the long-term Olympic grind. Gronow heads to the athletic training center to meet his teammates for an afternoon of weights.</p>\n<p>Walking into the training center, “Get on My Level,” by Wiz Khalifa plays in the background as workout motivation, but that doesn’t last long. Gronow walks into the trainer’s office and changes the music from rap to a playlist that gives off more of a modern, Ellie Goulding vibe. He says he doesn’t like rap music, and describes Jack Johnson as more his style.</p>\n<p>Although all of the players are completing their training circuits individually, their playful conversations and joking mannerisms in between sets make it apparent that they function as a single team unit.</p>\n<p>“He has done a great job as captain keeping the guys motivated and keeping the team together as a group,” Wigo said. “It has been the most consistent year for UCSB in a really long time, and he has contributed to that.”</p>\n<p>Gronow approached his role as team captain and leader through living by example. He believes it is better to create an equal relationship between the older and younger guys on the team by helping them choose their classes and hanging out with them outside of water polo.</p>\n<p>With only one month left in Santa Barbara before his graduation, Gronow hopes to say goodbye to the hundreds of people that have offered him friendship and have contributed to the ultimate California experience. He will then return to his native Australia to continue to play competitive water polo.</p>\n<p>Gronow is truly a product of his environment. With his appearance branded by sunshine and chlorine, and his heart molded by his amazing community of family and friends, he approaches each day with the goal of living passionately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53089\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53089\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/","id":5085,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5084,5083,5082],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson","biography":"Not available","articles":[595,5066,5085,5112,5113,5114,5115,5116,5117,5118,5119,5217,5219,5230,5231,5232,5233,5234,5237,5238,5239,5240,5241,5242,5254,5258,5259,5260,5263,5264,5265,5266,5267,5269,5287,5289,5290,5291,5292,5295],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Confident Heading into Rematches After Success Earlier in Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-8-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Two weeks remain on the schedule for the UCSB women's volleyball team.

Despite earning victories over the Titans and Highlanders in previous meetings earlier this season, the Gauchos have struggled when playing on the road and are 1-6 in away matches.</p>\n<p>The troubles for Fullerton continue to pile up as it remains winless this season. CSUF is 0-24 overall and 0-12 in conference play. Dating back to the end of last season, the Titans are now on a 27-match losing streak.</p>\n<p>Still performing at a high level for the Titans is junior outside hitter Paige Reed. Overall, she ranks fifth in the Big West in digs per set with a 3.95 average. Since the start of conference play, she has moved up to fourth place, averaging 4.26 digs per set. She leads Fullerton in digs with 179.</p>\n<p>With regard to teams getting better, the gradual improvements throughout UCR’s season have resulted in some historical highlights for the Highlanders, who are 9-16 overall and 4-8 in conference matches. For just the fifth time in program history, Riverside won back-to-back Big West matches with their five set victory over Cal State Northridge and sweep of CSUF last weekend. Its nine overall wins is its most since 2005.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the sweep of Northridge handed UCR its fourth conference win of the season, tying its program record for Big West wins.</p>\n<p>Despite earning the 3-1 victory, Santa Barbara’s offense seemed to be a little disheveled by the Highlanders’ defense, having finished the match with a .152 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>“We need consistency,” Lantagne Welch said. “A lot of that stems from our serve-receive and our passing. Riverside is a really good defensive team. We’ll be more ready for that this time. If we’re passing the ball well, we’re going to have opportunities to score.”</p>\n<p>Improvements on the defensive end will be important for UCSB as well in hopes of containing the Highlanders’ senior outside hitter Helena Peric.</p>\n<p>She recently earned Big West Offensive Player of the Week honors after a phenomenal performance against CSUN. She tallied a career-high 23 kills and had 12 digs for her second double-double of the season to go along with a .308 hitting percentage. She continued her dominance with 15 kills, six digs, two service aces and a .379 hitting clip against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ containment begins at the net, a component of their defense in which they have excelled.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s average of 2.10 blocks per set ranks third overall in the Big West. In three of its last four matches, UCSB has registered double-digit blocking totals. The centerpieces to the Gauchos’ denial at the net are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield.</p>\n<p>They both rank within the top 10 overall of the Big West rankings in blocks per set and total blocks. Sheffield holds the team lead in both statistical categories with 82 blocks and a 0.95 blocks per set average while Grunt is second with 78 blocks and a 0.91 average.</p>\n<p>While UCSB was unable to find much success offensively in its first match versus UCR, it did respond with a .302 hitting night against Cal State Fullerton the following night. The Gauchos’ confidence helped carry them to a strong attack but they must find that same determination when they are out of sync as well.</p>\n<p>“It comes and goes,” Lantagne Welch said. “When we’re doing well, we’re very confident. When we struggle, we lose it too quickly. That’s something about getting tougher in that scenario and knowing that teams are going to make big plays and we’re going to mess up some. That’s okay, it’s just we need to respond right away.”</p>\n<p>ESPN3 will nationally broadcast the match between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton this Friday, Nov. 13th at 4:30 p.m. The Gauchos will bring their weekend to a close at UC Riverside on Saturday, Nov. 14th at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/gauchos-confident-heading-into-rematches-after-success-earlier-in-season/","id":5082,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5081,5080,5079],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One Fighter of a Freshman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/water-polo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/water-polo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Freshman Goalkeeper Nikki Quinn Has Anchored the Gaucho Defense Despite a Broken Arm","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Entering college as a freshman can be one of the most exciting and terrifying things in a young person’s life.

For weeks I would go to practice, and I wasn’t allowed to touch a ball so I would just swim and do legs,” Quinn said. “I was just sitting there wanting to play, and in that month it made me realize how much I missed it.”</p>\n<p>The timing of her injury was made even worse due to the fact that Cathy Neushul, the coach who had recruited Quinn to UCSB, was replaced by current head coach Wolf Wigo in the offseason.</p>\n<p>“She mentioned to me in the beginning of summer that I would be the starting goalie, so that was a bummer,” Quinn said. “But I liked getting a new coach because it was a clean slate.”</p>\n<p>Quinn would have to wait to be able to prove herself though, as she worked herself back into game shape as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>She found inspiration wherever she could, whether it was from people telling her that she would never come back from the injury or from a famous athlete like recently-injured basketball star Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>As Quinn fought her way back from the injury, her work ethic and dedication to the team did not go unnoticed by her teammates. On a team full of young freshmen and sophomores, she found a way to stand out and make her presence felt despite being sidelined.</p>\n<p>“Nikki’s the type of person that goes above and beyond everything that she does,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “She didn’t want to miss anything; she wanted to still be involved in what the team was doing. She wants to get in with the team and do the extra amount of work even though she has a cast on.”</p>\n<p>After being sidelined for nearly four months and not playing in a competitive game since August, Quinn finally got her chance to play less than two weeks ago against the top team in the Big West: No. 5 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“The day before the game [Coach Wigo] asked me if I was ready to play, and I looked at him like ‘I’ve been ready. I want to play,’” Quinn said. “Mentally I was thinking, ‘I haven’t played in seven months, do I even know how to play?’ I was nervous, but after the first quarter I got back into the hang of it and it was fine.”</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for her to face her first test in a college game as the Anteaters found an opening early in the first quarter. However, what seemed to be an easy scoring opportunity from five meters turned out to be a remarkable first career save for Quinn.</p>\n<p>“In my mind that moment was a turning point, because a five-meter [shot] is an easy shot that should be made,” Martin said. “I can only imagine that it just boosts her confidence that much more. I think I speak for the whole team when I say that everyone was just really proud of her for holding her ground and doing what she needed to do.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the game, Quinn tallied a total of six saves and held Irvine, one of the most powerful offenses in the nation, to just six goals. Not too shabby for a freshman playing her first career game.</p>\n<p>“It definitely made me hopeful. I saw things in that game that I could’ve fixed,” Quinn said about her performance. “I think that’s what makes you a better player: when you think of all the mistakes you’ve done and how to fix them for the next game.”</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for Quinn to get her next chance to shine, as she was chosen to play the second half against No. 9 Cal State Northridge less than a week later. After finding herself in a tightly contested match that was clearly going down to the wire, Quinn stepped up in a big way.</p>\n<p>UCSB led by just one goal after sophomore utility Jessie Porter scored with under five minutes to go, and from then on the Matadors went into desperation mode looking for an equalizing goal.</p>\n<p>With just under a minute remaining, Quinn made an outstanding two-handed save right in front of a goal after a Northridge attacker fought herself free from a UCSB defender. The game wasn’t over yet though, and the Matadors were able to put together one more attack.</p>\n<p>Thanks to an untimely exclusion, the Gauchos found themselves playing 5-on-6 in the most crucial possession of the game, but Quinn came to the rescue once more.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 seconds remaining in the game, a Northridge attacker found herself wide open right in the middle of the UCSB defense. Her shot attempt to tie the game should have gone in easily, but Quinn made a one-handed save that was even more amazing than her previous one, preserving the win for Santa Barbara and making her unbeaten in her only two appearances.</p>\n<p>Despite her individual excellence, Quinn made it clear that she didn’t just have her own performance on her mind.</p>\n<p>“In the last couple minutes, you’re playing for your team,” Quinn said. “If you don’t block [those shots] then you’re letting them down.”</p>\n<p>While clutch plays are not expected to come from young players in their first games, Quinn’s mindset might be the most important reason why she’s been able to play so well under pressure in her few appearances thus far.</p>\n<p>“When the coach asks you which half you want to play, it’s like, ‘Do I want to set the tone in the first half or do I want to be in that situation where we’re down by one and need a stop?’” Quinn said, having personally asked to play in the second half rather than the first. “I like being the last one in the water.”</p>\n<p>Now, with the Big West Championships just a few days away, Quinn will have the opportunity to help her team win in its most important games of the season. Just as she has been all year though, she’s ready for the challenge, and her teammates are more than confident in her abilities to help them win.</p>\n<p>“If [Coach Wigo] picks Nikki then we all have the confidence in her,” Martin said. “You can see it in her eyes; she wants to win.”</p>\n<p>When Quinn hops in the pool this weekend, it’s going to be a tough test no matter who she’s facing.

With a roster stacked with young freshmen and sophomores, and each of their five losses coming against other top ranked teams, the Gauchos are not too worried about where they are right now.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I think we’re doing really well; we’re all gelling together and we’re working really well as a team,” junior utility Lauren Martin said. “The games two weeks ago were really rough, but even though we didn’t win those games we still did pretty well as a team for that being our first time playing together. We have room for improvement and it’s just the beginning.”</p>\n<p>Already at 0-5 against top-20 teams, UCSB will look to end this streak with a win over LMU. The Lions are off to an impressive 3-1 start, already having picked up a 12-7 win over No. 8 San Jose State in the UCLA Invite two weeks ago. Their only loss came against the No. 3 ranked Bruins with a final score of 15-6.</p>\n<p>LMU possesses one of the most powerful offensive machines in the country, already averaging an impressive mark of nearly 16 goals per game in wins. Senior attacker Alexandra Honny is averaging a team high 2.75 goals per game, while four of her teammates are averaging 1.75 or more per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re not really doing anything specific just because we’re playing LMU; we’re just going to play our game and see what we can do,” Martin said. “We’re working on our 6-on-5 as well as our 5-on-6 defense, and making sure that everything is flowing together.”</p>\n<p>Early in the season, the young Gaucho squad has been led by Martin, who has 11 goals through seven games. Just behind her on the stat sheet are freshman attacker Carly Christian with seven goals and last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year in sophomore utility Samantha Murphy with five.</p>\n<p>“Because everyone is so young we’re just all so close and I actually think it’s a good thing because there’s so much room for improvement,” Martin said. “I think the juniors and seniors are really good leaders and can show the way for these [younger players].”</p>\n<p>In seven games this season, UCSB has managed to score an average of seven goals per game, a number the Gauchos will likely need to surpass in order to come away with a win this weekend. In order for them to do so, one of the keys will be how well they can communicate out in the water.</p>\n<p>“We just need to make sure we’re talking as a team and I think that’s something we lacked two weeks ago,” Martin said. “We’ve been working a lot in practice on our communication.”</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on LMU at 12:30 p.m. this Saturday at Canyonview Aquatic Center.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/no-18-ucsb-faces-no-11-lmu-in-first-round-of-ucsd-triton-invite/","id":5084,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5083,5082,5081],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
