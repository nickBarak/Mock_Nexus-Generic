Junior infielder Fallon Bevino has also played in every game for Sacred Heart, doubling three times and tripling once, both Bevino and Delgadillo hold batting averages over .310.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will most likely face either senior Jamie Carlson or junior Kristen McCann on the mound Saturday. Carlson leads the team with 28 and third innings pitched, though McCann is not far behind with 22. Carlson is the team’s clear ace, though, leading the Pioneers with two wins, 23 strikeouts and a serviceable 3.21 earned run average.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB will be George Washington (6-6) quickly afterward at 3:30 p.m. The Colonials enter the weekend with three straight wins by a total score of 29-4, though the level of competition offered by their opponents, Quinnipiac and Monmouth, is certainly in question.</p>\n<p>George Washington finds the bulk of their offensive firepower from both the old and young, as senior infielder and pitcher Paige Kovalsky has been raking to start the season, and first-year catcher and infielder Jenna Cone has shot out of the gate like a cannon in 2017.</p>\n<p>Kovalsky is slashing a dumbfounding .432/.477/.568 with 11 RBI, five doubles and 11 runs scored. Cone has put forth an equally impressive line, hitting five home runs and 18 RBI, both team highs, while slashing .366/.395/.780.</p>\n<p>Sarah Costlow, a junior right-handed pitcher, is the team’s most relied upon the arm. She’s thrown a team-high 34 innings, starting in every one of her appearances this year. Her 4-2 record, combined with a 2.68 ERA, should have UCSB hoping to face freshman Kaitlin Buff, who has struggled more for the Colonials in her first 20 and two-thirds innings (2-2 record, 4.74 ERA).</p>\n<p>Her 4-2 record, combined with a 2.68 ERA, should have UCSB hoping to face freshman Kaitlin Buff, who has struggled more for the Colonials in her first 20 and two-thirds innings (2-2 record, 4.74 ERA).</p>\n<p>Sunday holds only one game for UCSB, a 1:30 p.m. contest with the 5-8 San Diego Toreros. USD will have already played Northern Colorado, UCSB’s final opponent for the weekend, earlier Sunday morning, giving the Gauchos an edge in terms of rested legs.</p>\n<p>The offense has been up and down for San Diego, though sophomores Taylor Spence (outfielder) and Lauren Kane (corner infielder) have supplied the team with consistent options atop the lineup.</p>\n<p>Spence is slashing .381/.447/.429, followed closely by Kane whose line stands at .375/.432/.525. The two have combined for nine RBI, six doubles, eight walks and 12 runs, and Kane has even gotten herself a triple in the season’s early going.</p>\n<p>Senior righty Megan Sabbatini leads the team with 47.2 innings pitched, more than double Lauren Berriatua (senior) who has the team’s second most. She’s been shaky in all those innings, however, racking up a 5.73 ERA, 3-6 record, allowing 10 home runs and a .333 opponent batting average.</p>\n<p>UCSB ends the Classic with a doubleheader against a less than formidable opponent in Northern Colorado, losers of three straight, on Monday, March 13, with the back-to-back games starting at 1 p.m. The Bears come into this matchup with only a 5-14 overall record thus far.</p>\n<p>The Bears again receive their main hitting contributions from the dynamic duo of senior Erica Dick (infielder) and sophomore Jordyn Wiatrack (catcher/infielder).</p>\n<p>Dick has slashed .333/.394/.550 with three homers, three other extra-base hits, and eight RBI, while Wiatrack has crushed four home runs of her own, a team high, and leads the squad with 12 RBI and 36 total bases.</p>\n<p>Senior Jayme Reddacliff is the only consistent option for the Bears on the mound, already having thrown for an eye-popping 63.1 innings on the season. Her 5.12 ERA and .306 opponent batting average are red flags, though, especially when juxtaposed with her 4-8 record. Northern Colorado figures to provide the Gauchos with an easier opponent to conclude their first weekend of home games in 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB showed a continued ability to win close games this past weekend with four of their wins coming by fewer than three runs. Though the strategy is not a statistically sustainable one, the grit of this Gaucho team does not go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer is up to four home runs, three doubles and 11 RBI on the season, and freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston are both up to two home runs and 11 and 7 RBI respectively. The power hitting is starting to come around for a Gaucho team that was in desperate need of deep ball hitters.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Veronika Gulvin was able to up her record to 6-4 over this past weekend and get her ERA below four (it now stands at 3.82).</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega (1-4, 7.81 ERA) is still a questionable option behind her, but Gulvin has begun to prove that she is the ace this team was pining for.</p>\n<p>After catching their first wave of consistent winning play this season in Utah last weekend, the Gauchos will try to continue the trend back in sunny Santa Barbara at their first hosted tournament of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts the Gaucho Classic I beginning at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 11, at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin led the way with 10 points, while senior guard Max Heidegger and junior forward Robinson Idehen both chipped in 6 points off the bench.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For whatever reason, the rim was much less hospitable to the Gauchos in the second half. A Max Heidegger layup, almost four minutes into the half, provided UCSB’s first points of the period and stanched an 8-0 Hawaii run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The damage, however, was done. The Gauchos never led again, or even managed to trim the lead down to two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s shooting numbers fell off a cliff to 36% in the second half, while Hawai’i’s stayed stable at 50%. Heidegger was the lone bright spot for the Gauchos with 15 points in the second half, giving him a game-high 21 overall, but his teammates were only able to muster up 13 points combined in the last 20 minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Futile as it was, Heidegger’s offensive performance was a promising sign for UCSB. Saturday’s game was the senior’s second since returning from a 10-game absence and was an impressive return to form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Warriors, on the other hand, pulled ahead with a balanced attack that saw four players score at least 6 points, but no player scored more than 8 points in the second half. Hawai’i’s balance held true all game: junior guard Drew Buggs led the team with 12 points, but three other players scored at least 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buggs also played the role of facilitator on Saturday and played it masterfully. The junior dished out 12 assists against just 2 turnovers, a sterling ratio for any point guard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, meanwhile, struggled to distribute the ball. The UCSB team combined for 3 assists, their lowest total of the season and just the third time they’ve finished with less than 10 assists in a game this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i also outrebounded the Gauchos, 33 to 23, on Saturday. Nine of those Rainbow Warrior rebounds were on the offensive glass, compared to just 2 for the Gauchos, giving the hosts a 10-4 advantage in second-chance points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore big man Amadou Sow is typically UCSB’s go-to man on the glass, but he was limited to just over 18 minutes by foul trouble. Sow picked up 2 fouls in both halves, which forced Gaucho head coach Joe Pasternack to rely more heavily on the back up Idehen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s loss was two in a row for the Gauchos, who have struggled offensively in Big West play. The struggle hasn’t been consistent from game to game, as UCSB shot reasonably well but turned the ball over 17 times in the team’s loss to Long Beach State last week, complicating efforts to find a panacea for the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A panacea might be hard to find, but the Gauchos will need to find some sort of patch as Big West play continues if they want to contend. UCSB hosts CSUN on Wednesday night and then UC Riverside on Saturday, two teams above the Gauchos in the conference standings. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/behind-offensive-struggles-ucsb-falls-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/behind-offensive-struggles-ucsb-falls-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/behind-offensive-struggles-ucsb-falls-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/behind-offensive-struggles-ucsb-falls-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/behind-offensive-struggles-ucsb-falls-to-hawaii/","id":40,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[39,38,37],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Softball Hoping To Shake Latest Slump at St. George Red Desert Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-19-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently on a two-game winning streak, UCSB softball is in a must-win situation at 4-10 heading into the weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Five games stand before the 4-10 UCSB softball team this weekend in Cedar City, Utah at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

Her partner in the infield, freshman Alyssa Diaz, will also be important to the Gauchos’ success this weekend, with two home runs and the same nine RBI in her first 14 games of college softball.</p>\n<p>The biggest test in Cedar City will be whether or not the Gaucho pitchers can come around after a rough start to 2017. Sophomore Veronika Gulvin and freshman Felisha Noriega have been the team’s stalwarts, but both have struggled mightily. Gulvin has three of the team’s four wins, and she holds the better ERA, but both have four losses, and “better” doesn’t necessarily mean good, with Gulvin’s ERA sitting at 4.56 and Noriega’s at 8.24.</p>\n<p>For the Wolverines, senior outfielder Courtney Beavers has been the team’s most impressive hitter, slashing .571/.625/.786, with three doubles, three runs scored and 11 total bases, all of which pace the team. Senior middle infielder Brittney Vansway has had a hand in much of the team’s production, knocking seven RBI in the season’s first four games.</p>\n<p>Junior Lauren Frailey leads the team with nine and a third innings pitched, and she has only allowed eight hits and two earned runs over that span. Senior Bailey Moore is close on her tail with eight innings thrown, and her 3.50 ERA isn’t too shabby either, suggesting the Gauchos will face a tougher path than the Wolverine’s 0-4 record would indicate.</p>\n<p>Iowa State (7-7) has been a streaky team to start the season, sweeping the Tennessee State Tournament the weekend of Feb. 17 before failing to win a game in the following weekend’s slate.</p>\n<p>Led by freshman infielder Sami Williams and junior outfielder Kelsey McFarland, the Cyclones pack an impressive punch offensively. Williams has slashed .300/.349/.625 to start the year, but somehow is being outdone by McFarland, who’s put up a .463/.521/.610 line.</p>\n<p>While Williams has the edge in RBI and home runs (11 to nine and three to one, respectively), McFarland gains her advantage having drawn three more walks, accumulated seven more hits and scored two more runs.</p>\n<p>The team boasts three impressive pitchers, all with ERA at or below 3.26. Sophomore Savannah Sanders is by far the team’s most relied-upon arm, as she’s thrown almost double the innings of her teammates (43) and appeared in 12 of Iowa State’s 14 games.</p>\n<p>Saturday will pit the Gauchos against the 8-5 Nevada Wolf Pack and the dynamic corner infield duo of sophomore Alyssa Mendez at third base and junior Jennifer Purcell at first. It’s been a hot start to the season for both, who’ve put up staggering hitting numbers as well as holding down the infield defense.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Kali Sargent and senior McKenna Isenberg head the pitching rotation, and the Gauchos will have to work their way around the two savvy, veteran throwers, who’ve accounted for the vast majority of the team’s innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The afternoon opponent for UCSB on the 4th will be Southern Utah, a 1-7 team that has failed to score more than three runs in all but one game. Five of the Thunderbirds’ games saw the team score one or zero runs, good news for a Gauchos pitching staff which struggled at the season’s onset.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Sarah Murphy is the team’s leading hitter with a .385 average, but her identical slugging percentage shows just how little extra base hitting she’s been able to provide the team. Sophomore utility player Kendall Kapitzke has the team’s one home run, and her .176 batting average is propped up by a .462 OBP.</p>\n<p>The Thunderbirds have tried several pitchers this season, but senior Kristen Hostetler has been the most relied upon, throwing in four games, starting a team-high three and doubling second place on her team with 16.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final match of the weekend will have the Gauchos face a Nebraska-Omaha team they were able to overcome 4-3 in extra innings at Stanford on Feb. 19. Since that game, the Mavericks have hit a losing streak, dropping four of their following five games.</p>\n<p>The lineup, which has been remarkably consistent with eight players starting and playing in all 13 of the Mavericks games, is led by two stud outfielders junior Kelly Pattison and senior Lia Mancuso. The former has a slash line of .359/.419/.615, three home runs, eight RBI and seven runs scored, while the latter has almost been her match, slashing .351/.400/.541, batting in four runs, taking one ball deep and collecting four doubles.</p>\n<p>Pitching has been more of a struggle for Nebraska-Omaha, with neither sophomore Laura Roecker nor senior Abbie Clanton, the team’s two main pitchers, having winning records or earning run averages below 4.00.</p>\n<p>Keys to the weekend will be the Gauchos’ ability to keep the game close, as they’ve had a penchant for getting blown out in games they lose. Furthermore, if the ‘Chos are able to get the bats firing and they can get up at least four or five runs per game, the pitching staff should be able to hold it down from there.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/softball-hoping-to-shake-latest-slump-at-st-george-red-desert-classic/","id":41,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[40,39,38],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go Undefeated in Utah, Return Home for Gaucho Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Facing a must-win situation as the Big West schedule gradually comes closer, the UCSB softball team swept each opponent at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

With the Mavericks only recording four hits throughout the game, UCSB capitalized by getting the run it needed to win in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Following Sunday’s game, the Gauchos are now 3-0 when playing in extra innings.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos got out to a sluggish start against Southern Utah, giving up three early runs in the top of the first inning. For Southern Utah, senior first baseman Karlee Manzione homered and brought three runs in, allowing her teammates senior infielder/outfielder Payton Hart and junior outfielder Sarah Murphy to score.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasn’t fazed, however, as they answered back in the bottom of the first, starting with sophomore second baseman Sierra Altmeyer’s homer, which brought junior outfielder Jessica Johnston in to score as well.</p>\n<p>Both teams were off to fast starts, and the game sat at 3-2 Thunderbirds following the first inning. The Gauchos went on in the bottom of the second to tie the game 3-3 with the help of a single by Hinojosa, bringing freshman infielder Kayla Krantz in to score a run.</p>\n<p>After some scoreless innings for both teams, the Gauchos secured a one-run lead in the fifth. At this point the Gauchos held all the momentum, keeping the Thunderbirds at bay thanks to junior pitcher Lena Mayer, who got her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>With a shot from Johnston, Hinojosa was brought in, securing the Gauchos’ 5-3 victory over the Thunderbirds. Johnston went 4-4 at the plate during this, including bringing in Clark for a run with a single up the middle.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Gauchos faced off against a Nevada team that would be shut out in five innings by Gulvin, who earned 10 strikeouts. After two innings, the teams were tied at 0-0, but in the third a wild pitch from Nevada saw UCSB senior third baseman Emily Brucelas score. Brucelas went on to bring in Altmeyer for a 2-0 lead. Soon after, freshman infielder Whitney Pemberton brought in Hinojosa with a single.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of fifth, Nevada still scoreless at this point, the Gauchos increased their lead to 5-0 with contributions from Diaz and Altmeyer off of a sacrifice fly from junior infielder Samantha Lujan and a single from Brucelas, who went a perfect 3-3 at bat.</p>\n<p>Nevada finally scored with an effort from junior outfielder Aaliyah Gibson, allowing senior outfielder Raquel Martinez to score the sole run for the Wolf Pack. Beating Nevada 5-1, the Gauchos built off of momentum from their two wins Friday.</p>\n<p>On Friday, UCSB looked to keep things rolling against Iowa State following the morning win against Utah Valley. The Gauchos got on the board early with the help of Pemberton’s solo homer in the top of the second inning. In the bottom of the third, the Cyclones tied up the game with a run from senior outfielder Cathlin Bingham.</p>\n<p>The next three innings saw the advancement of a 4-1 Gaucho lead, beginning with a run from Pemberton in the fourth. In the fifth, Pemberton’s fourth double of the day saw Johnston score to establish a 3-1 lead. The Gauchos continued with another run in the sixth, thanks to a sac fly by Clark’s, which brought freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez home to make the game 4-1.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, the game appeared to be coming to a close. However, the Cyclones rallied with the help of a single from sophomore catcher Kaylee Bosworth and a homer from freshman infielder Talyn Lewis. With the game now a close 4-3, freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega came up big for the Gauchos with a final strikeout for her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Friday, the Gauchos competed against a talented Utah Valley team, squeezing a 9-7 win over the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>Following the second inning, the Wolverines were up 4-0 after a four-run inning. Pemberton finally got the Gauchos on the board with a double in the fourth to bring Altmeyer home. Following two runs from Clark and freshman catcher Nyssa Williams, at a second at bat in the fourth Pemberton doubled to bring in Altmeyer and Johnston for a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines used some momentum to rally and score three runs in the bottom of the sixth, making the game 7-5. Down two runs in the seventh, UCSB needed to come up big to secure a win, and they did just that. Pemberton made her presence felt again, hitting a double to bring Johnston home to make the score 7-6.</p>\n<p>Following a Krantz strikeout and with two outs on the board, UCSB rallied to make the game 9-7 with hits from Lujan and Hinojosa, allowing Altmeyer, Brucelas and Pemberton to score at home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos not only came up big on offense in the seventh, but they also shut out Utah Valley in the final inning to win the high-scoring game 9-7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 9-10 thanks to their 5-0 sweep in Utah. They will look to continue that energy as they play host to teams in the Gaucho Classic, which will tip off Saturday, March 11 at 1:30 p.m. at Campus Diamond. The Gauchos will play Sacred Heart to open their weekend and will also face George Washington, San Diego and Northern Colorado twice over the course of the Classic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-go-undefeated-in-utah-return-home-for-gaucho-classic/","id":42,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[41,40,39],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
