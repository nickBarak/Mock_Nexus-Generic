Not only are the Gauchos a league-best 5-1, but they also possess a 27-5 overall record, the best winning percentage in the nation (.844),  and are currently on a nine-game winning streak — that’s only their second best run this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to continue this hot streak it has going when it welcomes UC Davis into town this weekend. The Aggies are currently 11-18 overall and are tied for seventh in the Big West with a 3-6 conference mark.</p>\n<p>All season long, Santa Barbara has produced efficient play, both at the plate and on the field. Last weekend’s sweep of UCI, however, proved that this UCSB team is not a fluke, they are for real.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In that series, the Gauchos pitching staff held the Anteaters to just an average of five hits and one run per game. Coming into that series, Irvine had averaged eight hits per game and nearly seven runs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB totaled 28 hits and 17 runs during the series. Irvine had given up an average of seven hits and just 3.5 runs per game before the three-game set.</p>\n<p>Point is, UCSB proved a lot last weekend, and, despite UC Davis posing less of a threat, there is no doubt this team is still gearing to prove everybody wrong.</p>\n<p>Sitting at first place in the Big West, the Gauchos are currently in prime position to claim its first Big West title since 1986.</p>\n<p>A big reason for that is the renewed offensive output, specifically, power hitting. The Gauchos have already surpassed their home run total of 2018 (34), with 38 thus far with 22 games still remaining.</p>\n<p>This season, UCSB is 22-1 when hitting at least one home run in a game. It is 5-4 when it fails to do so.</p>\n<p>Even beyond the long ball, Santa Barbara leads the entire country in triples with 21. Outfielders Armani Smith and Tommy Jew keep jockeying for the team lead in triples with the former having six and latter having five. Smith is ranks second in the country while Jew ranks ninth.</p>\n<p>Funny enough, Smith and Jew are also tied for the most home runs on the team with each having eight a piece.</p>\n<p>Junior catcher Eric Yang is also continuing his great season. Yang leads UCSB with a .393 batting average which also ranks 43 in the country. His 34 RBI’s are also a team high.</p>\n<p>The catcher has also been a beast behind the plate, boasting a .996 fielding percentage and he has thrown out 50% of base runners attempting to steal.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s pitching staff has also been nothing short of great. The staff currently ranks eighth in WHIP (1.13) and 13th in ERA (3.20) in the country.</p>\n<p>Friday starter Ben Brecht has been awesome this season. Brecht leads the Big West and ranks fourth in the nation with seven wins and boasts a 2.75 ERA. His 69 strikeouts are also the best in the league.</p>\n<p>Junior right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln has also been a reliable arm out the pen, especially in the clutch, as his eight saves are tied for the league high. Freshman pitcher Michael McGreevy, the usual first pitcher out of the pen for the ‘Chos, currently possesses the best ERA in the league with a 1.57.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are led by sophomore infielder Tanner Murray at the plate, who leads the team with a .427 BA with one home run and 14 RBIs. He earned a Big West Field Player of the Week honor earlier this season.</p>\n<p>The pitching staff is led by Friday starter Brett Erwin who is 3-3 with a 2.79 ERA. As a team, the Aggies hit .280 and have a team ERA of 5.76.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB has proven how good it is this season, especially at home where the team is 17-1. Now, Santa Barbara can’t afford to take its foot off the pedal. It has to continue the pace it is playing at, lock up a Big West title, and who knows what else.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s second ever host for a regional or even its first host for a Super Regional.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin its series against UC Davis at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 18 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Game two will commence at 3 p.m. on Friday while game three will start at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the same location.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.  of the April 18, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Brecht would walk the opening batter of the game then hit the next one giving Irvine runners on first and second.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Brandon Lewis, a member of the USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award Midseason Watch List, brought home a run for the ‘Eaters lacing a ball through left field.</p>\n<p>With runners on the corners and no outs, Brecht responded by getting the next Irvine batter, Adrian Damla, to hit into a double play, then struck out Mike Peadbody to end the first allowing just one run despite the shaky start.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the first, junior center fielder Tommy Jew kept the bottom half of the first frame alive by rocketing a ball to right field to leg out his fifth triple of the year. He would come around to score following an RBI single from Rowan tying the match at 1-1.</p>\n<p>After that Lewis RBI single, Brecht really settled in retiring the next 11 batters not allowing another hit until the fifth inning. By then, UCSB held a 2-1 advantage thanks to a home run to left center from Rowan in the third inning, the only hit of that inning.</p>\n<p>Even with allowing a hit in the fifth plus a walk, Brecht kept working his way out of every jam. In the top of the eighth, up 2-1, with two outs, UCSB’s defense faltered. It faltered in a way very reminiscent to the Gauchos losses at St. Mary’s and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>First, sophomore third baseman Jason Willow could not field a ball hit down the line to him, then junior short stop McClain O’Connor misplayed a ball. This set up Irvine with the tying run on second and the go-ahead on first.</p>\n<p>Following the two errors, Brecht would be relieved by freshman Michael McGreevy. Brecht finished the day allowing just three hits and walked two batters. His eight strikeouts give him 69 on the year, pushing him back in front of having the league’s most K’s.</p>\n<p>McGreevy inherited the two runners, and did not let them go anywhere forcing a ground out, ending the top half of the frame.</p>\n<p>Up 2-1, UCSB needed a few more insurance runs just to keep themselves in a favorable position heading into the ninth. The Gauchos got those runs thanks to a solo home run from Rowan to kick off the inning.</p>\n<p>After the round tripper, junior outfielder Armani Smith ripped a ball to left center to leg out his team-high sixth triple of the year. A double from Andrew Martinez would bring home Smith and give UCSB a 4-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In the ninth, McGreevy gave up one hit, but nothing else en route to his fifth save of the year and securing Santa Barbara’s game one, 4-1 win.</p>\n<p>All-in-all, UCSB played a good game, delivering nine hits on the day and handing junior Andre Pallante his third loss of the year.</p>\n<p>Today’s win also marks another positive for UCSB: it continues to highlight that this team is for real.

His power hitting was responsible for seven of the Gauchos’ 18 runs over the span of the four contests. His current mark of 14 homeruns leads the Big West and surpassed his former career-high of 11 last season. Collectively, the Gauchos rank second in the conference with 41 homers.</p>\n<p>Although Bush has managed to carry the offensive load for UCSB as of late, the Gauchos’ pitching core has been the victim of allowing a slew of runs during games in which they started off well but could not sustain their play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last three losses have included at least three allowed runs in a single inning. In the final game of its series against the Titans, UCSB allowed eight runs in the third, and in its weekday matchup against St. Mary’s it conceded nine runs in the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>The inconsistencies on the mound should be a cause of concern for the Gauchos as they prepare to face a Cal Poly team that thrives at the plate as it leads the conference in hits at 469 and is second in batting average with a .274 clip, on par with UCSB’s average.</p>\n<p>Hoping to capitalize on UCSB’s disappointing 5.15 ERA is the Mustangs’ sophomore outfielder Alex McKenna.</p>\n<p>Named to the Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American Team by <em>Collegiate Baseball Newspaper</em> in his freshman season, McKenna’s .357 hitting average ranks second-best in the Big West. Able to apply pressure when batting, he also is a threat when on-base as he is fifth in the conference with 12 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>What could be the most significant aspect of how the rivaled series will play out this weekend is the performance of the Mustangs’ pitching staff. More specifically, Cal Poly’s ability to not give up homeruns will be pivotal.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Mustangs have allowed a league-low 17 dingers and have been even more efficient during conference play with just four homeruns allowed.</p>\n<p>Setting the foundation to such a small allowance is Cal Poly’s heat on the mound as it sits atop the Big West with 410 strikeouts. Leading the Mustangs is the pitching duo of sophomore Spencer Howard and junior Erich Uelmen. Both rank second and third in the conference in strikeouts per nine innings as Howard averages 9.71 and Uelmen at 8.85, respectively.</p>\n<p>This past Saturday, Howard tallied Cal Poly’s first complete game of the season in a 5-2 win over CSUN. He threw 118 pitches, allowed seven hits, two earned runs and finished with 10 strikeouts. Uelmen has consistently held up his end as he has struck out 80 batters thus far, ranking third in the conference.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos possess the firepower to go hit-for-hit against Cal Poly, their fate ultimately comes down to how well they can challenge the Mustangs’ pitching.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry series will begin this Friday, May 19, at 3 p.m. The start time for Saturday’s game is 2 p.m., while Sunday’s closing game will begin at noon.

The documentary was compiled as a mid-century reflection after the bank burned down 50 years ago on Feb. 25, 1970.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93125\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2054792904\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93120\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93125\" class=\"wp-image-93125 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IV_Unrest_BankOnFire_N-1-1024x710.jpg?resize=888%2C616\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"616\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1970, KCSB reporters covered the protests live in Isla Vista. </span><em>Courtesy of UCSB Library Special Collections</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1970, KCSB reporters covered the protests live in Isla Vista, providing listeners with the sights and sounds of the turmoil, until the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office forced the station to shut down for five days, according to Tim Owens, a former UC Santa Barbara student and the current general manager of KCSB. The police department claimed at the time that the radio station was preventing them from doing their jobs in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Owens explained, I.V.’s Bank of America at the time had become a symbol of the capitalist establishment, which many student activists attributed as the cause of oppressive social issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hour-long special takes listeners on a deep dive into the KCSB archives, featuring KCSB news coverage of the Isla Vista riots — often phoned in at the scene from telephone booths — the bank burning and recordings that depicted police violence against protestors, according to Lisa Osborn, current news director at KCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound bites from key players like the Santa Barbara Police Department and then-defense attorney in the Chicago Seven trial William Kunstler, as well as accounts from former students, provide different perspectives on what happened and the consequences that followed. Sound bites of I.V. and narration from Owens illustrate the entirety of I.V. in 1970, later coined the “Year of Rebellion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For Isla Vista, 1970 was the scene of a bank burning, a fatal shooting with a student by a police office, novel law enforcement riot tactics, police brutality and mass arrests,” Owens said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What came in February, April and June in Isla Vista spun its web around the symbol of the establishment: the Bank of America,” Owen said in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program takes a chronological approach, starting with the events that lead up to the Bank of America burning in February before taking listeners through the consequences that followed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A day before the Bank of America building burned, the special says the Santa Barbara Police arrested two men. According to the special, the warrants for their arrests cited their use of obscenities during an earlier protest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An argument ensued between the officers and the men, forming a crowd that quickly grew upset when the men were arrested. The crowd took action, desecrating the policeman’s car and eventually lighting it on fire. Another officer removed the police from the scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, and hours before the infamous bank burning, Kunstler had been scheduled to speak at the Harder stadium. The special included the audio from Kunstler’s speech at Harder Stadium, which focused on the frustrations of youth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In his book, Justice Douglas said the establishment today is the same as George the third. And he said if the establishment does not stop its stampede toward oppression and repression, then the only honorable course is what men did in 1776,” Kunstler said in his speech at Harder Stadium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owens explained how the timing of Kunstler’s speech, and the bank burning later that day, led the former state Attorney General to investigate Kunstler for inciting a riot. No evidence involving Kunstler was found, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when authorities showed up later that evening to control the crowds gathered on Embarcadero del Norte, they “proceeded to fire hundreds of rounds of tear gas at the demonstrators,” the special stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tensions climaxed at the Bank of America building, where Embarcadero Hall stands today. The bank was first looted and later set on fire — twice —  first around 7 p.m. when a dumpster was lit on fire and again around midnight when gasoline was used to rekindle the blaze, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, KCSB was broadcasting it all live. Owens extracted these clips from vintage KCSB archives to allow listeners to hear from the reporters who very first covered it, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pardall may be clear now, I’m not sure. I am beginning to feel the tear gas in my throat. I hear teargas rockets continuing to be fired off, which means they are coming from the overpass,” an unnamed KCSB reporter phoned in to the radio station.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the chaos ensued, KCSB student reporters described the riot’s atmosphere, preserving the sounds and images they witnessed from the streets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“An incendiary device has been thrown into the Bank of America right now, and it is burning very brightly on the floor with high flames shooting almost to the roof,” an anonymous KCSB reporter said. “However, again, you have your opposing factions in Isla Vista because almost as soon as that device was off inside the Bank of America, two guys went running through and attempted to stomp out the fire.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April 18, a second riot occured at the bank. Violence ensued when it became known that the UCSB administration canceled a scheduled speech by a Chicago 7 defendant, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this riot, Santa Barbara police officer David Gosselin shot and killed 22-year-old UCSB student Kevin Moran, an economics major who was seeking to protect the bank from other student protestors. Gosselin, according to the special, claimed his rifle had misfired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemonium and confusion caused by the heavy exchange of gunfire during the first moments of conflict make it impossible at this time to accurately determine whether or not the officer fired the fatal projectile,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff James Webster said in a sound bite from a press conference featured in the special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the second protest, KCSB was ordered by Sheriff Webster to shut down its broadcasts; Webster stated at the time that KCSB’s broadcasting of the officer’s operations and locations were “making the enforcement of this area absolutely intolerable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webster claimed he had the authority to shut down KCSB’s broadcasts despite dismissing questions about federal protections over the press, according to the special. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They shut down KCSB — that’s very rare, because we’re licensed by the federal government, not the local cops, but because the Regents hold our license, supposedly, they wanted us off the air,” Osborn said, explaining how local police blamed KCSB for inciting violence at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB returned to air five days later and continued to cover life in I.V., including having interviews with community residents who recounted the violence they witnessed. During the special, one woman recounts seeing the police assaulting her husband, describing the sequence as she chokes back tears. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Somebody yelled, ‘I think the police were coming.’ He stopped and the police rushed up the stairs, grabbed him and hit him in the stomach and dragged him down,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third disturbance in June led to a strictly enforced curfew and an increased presence from the Los Angeles Special Enforcement Bureau in I.V., leading to numerous complaints from residents, according to Owens in the documentary. Godfrey recalls that from dusk until dawn, no one was allowed outside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bank of America eventually closed its Isla Vista branch for good in 1981; now, Embarcadero Hall, a UCSB lecture hall, stands in its place.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/half-a-century-later-the-bank-of-america-fire-remains-burned-into-i-v-s-legacy-with-help-of-kcsb-radio-documentary/","id":4103,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4102,4101,4100],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
