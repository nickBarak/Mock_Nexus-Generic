The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has been selling raspados, mangonadas and other treats in Isla Vista and UCSB for the past three years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the campaign’s creation in February, $490 out of the $85,000 goal has been raised. The $85,000 primary goal is to cover the cost of a “professional” food cart as well as permits and insurance Camacho needs to sell on campus, according to the campaign’s </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/HijinoEloteroman\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M.U.J.E.R. co-chair and third-year sociology major Dulce Gonzalez</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created the campaign in hopes of gathering financial and community support for Camacho’s return to campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign was first posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook, and organizers have been tagging larger news outlets like Univision and Mitù in hopes to gain support beyond the UCSB community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to collaborate with him because he’s not only trying to get back on campus to fundraise and help student orgs out with their fundraising, but we also want to try to expand his business,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho hopes to raise enough funds to help him purchase a food truck from a vendor in Los Angeles that would be built to fit Camacho’s needs. The cost of converting a vehicle into a food truck ranges from $95,000 to $120,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Sep. 2017, the Office of Student Life and the office for Environmental Health and Safety have implemented regulations that require vendors like Camacho to obtain either a Temporary Food Service permit, which has a fee of approximately $180, or a Mobile Food Facility permit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A general liability insurance that covers up to approximately $2 million in coverage is also required. The yearly payment for general liability insurance for a food cart vendor can range from $500 to $1000 a year, according to Brashears Insurance. For a food truck, the yearly payment can cost between $5,000 to $7,500 a year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camacho has since held fundraisers in Isla Vista but has experienced issues with the county food inspectors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has been asked to remove his stand by inspectors due to the proximity of a public restroom from his food booth, although he does have the necessary permits to sell in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believes that a food truck would allow him to comfortably sell both on campus and in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unos de mi mayores gustos es trabajar con los estudiantes.

The lawsuit states that Balter, through his blog posts and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbalter/status/1208445918393065477\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several</span></a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbalter/status/1268963951481675782\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from his Twitter account, has interfered with Kurin’s career prospects and tenure application.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his first blog post about Kurin and Gomez Choque in February, Balter reported that Gomez Choque sexually harassed students from UCSB and other universities during a summer field school in Peru 2015, according to Title IX documents; he added that Kurin then retaliated against students involved in a subsequent 2016 Title IX case filed against Gomez Choque and Kurin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To report this, Balter obtained a copy of a 2016 Title IX case filed against both Gomez Choque and Kurin under the California Public Records Act and interviewed numerous witnesses of Gomez Choque and Kurin’s alleged actions at the field school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurin reached a settlement with UCSB over the Title IX investigation in 2016, according to David Scher, Kurin’s lawyer in the lawsuit. University spokesperson Andrea Estrada declined to comment because the university “is not a party to that lawsuit.” Casey Walsh, an anthropology professor and chair of the department, did not respond to multiple requests for comment about both Kurin’s Title IX investigation and the lawsuit.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Dr. Kurin is not a perfect individual. She made some mistakes a few years ago and has apologized for them, acknowledged them, took responsibility for her actions and completed a settlement with the university that everybody was happy with,” Scher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scher confirmed that Kurin was charged with “sustained charges” by the Title IX office in 2016, meaning that the claims of misconduct by both Kurin and Gomez Choque were found to be substantiated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Balter’s blog posts, UCSB placed Kurin on a three-year suspension from Spring 2016 to Fall 2019. While on suspension, Kurin ran a summer field school in Peru with Gomez Choque and during the 2018 program, Gomez Choque allegedly sexually assaulted a student, Balter reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada declined to confirm whether Kurin had been placed on suspension. The lawsuit states that b</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">etween 2016 and 2018, Kurin “engaged in the UCSB disciplinary process and utilizing the proper forums available to her as a professor, she amicably settled the matter with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB in March 2018.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scher said that Kurin was on leave, which he says she took “of her own account partly,” between 2016 and 2019, “as a way to resolve the case so that the university could be satisfied that she was going to do what she needed to do to come back to the university in good standing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurin’s lawsuit alleges that in reporting about the Title IX investigation and Kurin’s suspension, “Balter acted with overt malice, hatred, and ill will towards Kurin.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s trying to destroy her. He’s trying to prevent her from getting tenure. That’s what he’s doing. That is why we filed this lawsuit,” Scher told the Nexus over Zoom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not all false,” he said, referring to Balter’s reporting, “but a lot of it is dramatically exaggerated and we cannot take it anymore. We’re tired of it. He just needs to stop and go away so that Dr. Kurin can go before the tenure board truthfully, honestly, with actual facts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit states that Balter’s blogs “repeatedly demand that Kurin not be granted tenure and that she otherwise be banned from any kind of gainful employment.” The lawsuit points to instances from Balter’s past as evidence of a pattern of misconduct, including negative Amazon reviews of </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Goddess-Bull-Catalhoyuk-Archaeological-Civilization/dp/1598740695/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594356393&amp;refinements=p_27%3AMichael+Balter&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a book</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Balter wrote in 2009 called “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goddess and the Bull: Catalhoyuk–An Archaeological Journey to the Dawn of Civilization,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which centered around an archaeological dig. The lawsuit says the book focuses more on “who [the archeologists] hooked up with and when.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit describes Balter’s dismissal from his former job at Science Magazine, alleging it was for “misconduct” and a “serious breach of trust,” both of which Balter denied on his blog, on social media and when speaking to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said his dismissal from Science Magazine was due to a “longstanding mutual breakdown of trust” and that Kurin “cherry-picked negative things about my book.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She was basically trying to paint me out as being somebody who maybe knew nothing about archaeology and who was constantly getting fired from jobs that I actually really was not fired from,” Balter said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One part of this case centers around Balter’s wording in his reporting, in which he frequently describes Kurin being found “guilty” of retaliation by a Title IX investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said that he used the word “guilty” in the colloquial sense, not a legal sense, while Scher said that Balter’s use of the word implies that Kurin was convicted of a crime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Title IX charged her [with] sustained charges. Sustaining charges does not mean guilty,” but instead means that the claims in the Title IX case against both Gomez Choque and Kurin were found to be substantiated, Scher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he stands by his use of the word “guilty” and won’t retract his blog posts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not apologizing for the word guilty …  And I think that they can’t win the case on that; in the colloquial sense of the word, she was found guilty of misconduct by Title IX,” Balter said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said that “the University investigates all reports of alleged misconduct by faculty” but could not comment on specific cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit cites Balter’s social media posts as evidence that he acted with overt malice against Kurin and knowingly published false statements against her, such as reporting that Kurin attempted to cover up Gomez Choque’s alleged misconduct and refused to cooperate with the Title IX investigation. In those posts, Balter called on UCSB and the anthropology department to not give Kurin tenure, according to the lawsuit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter argues he has a First Amendment right to post his opinions on his blog and social media, including those encouraging UCSB to not give Kurin tenure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have said openly and publicly that I do not believe Danielle Kurin should be given tenure, because I think that her misconduct shows that she cannot be trusted around students,” Balter said. “I’m entitled to have an opinion under the First Amendment about what the result of all this should be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he carries no malice toward Kurin because he had never heard of her before he began reporting on her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I haven’t made up any stories about Danielle Kurin. I haven’t said anything about her that I don’t firmly believe to be true based on my own reporting,” Balter said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter has until Aug. 15 to respond to the lawsuit, less than a month before Kurin’s tenure review is scheduled to begin. Scher said he plans to update the lawsuit with more examples of Balter’s alleged overt malice toward Kurin in an amended filing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he is looking for a First Amendment lawyer to take on his case, but said he is confident that his reporting and social media posts are protected under the law. He has also created a </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/freedom-of-the-press-defense-fund-kurin-v-balter\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cover upcoming legal expenses and has since raised over $3,700 as of July 11. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I reported the truth. I reported it faithfully. I reported it in good faith.

For the leasing aspect of the website, prospective tenants can review topics such as landlord responsiveness and timely repairs, as well as general experiences in renting from the landlord. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move-out section will allow tenants to say whether their landlord set clear expectations for the move-out, such as whether or not the prospective tenant is expected to hire an outside cleaning company, according to Menzhausen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The renter will also be able to choose whether or not they would recommend their landlord to others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s almost like when you sign up for classes, right, with RateMyProfessor, you want to know what you’re getting into,” Menzhausen said. “The syllabus may not encompass everything that’s actually going to happen.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landlords will be able to respond to what their tenants post about them, but renter posts themselves will be anonymous in order to prevent possible retaliation, according to Lieberman. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some landlords have expressed concerns over how renters might use the website, especially if it is based on anonymous reviews. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t usually say anything [on review websites] unless they’re upset,” said Michelle Roberson, president of Sierra Property Management. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When they’re trying to get leverage over a situation, that’s when they go on there to make things go their way.

Obviously we have been really frustrated the last few games feeling like we are right there and having chances to win the game, but we are growing up and we have to do it fast,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Currently sitting at 22-22-1 on the year overall and 7-8 in the Big West, Santa Barbara finds themselves at No. 6 in the conference standings and a good five games behind first place Cal State Fullerton.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With just nine games left in the league schedule and the almost certain fate that the winner of the Big West will be the only one to receive a NCAA Regional bid, UCSB is running out of time to lose any more contests this season.</p>\n<p>“Winning out is our only shot. We are going to have to do that, and with the way Fullerton has played, hope they somehow lose some,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Even worse, this weekend the Gauchos will be headed on the road to face the rival Dirtbags. On the road this season, UCSB is 4-10.</p>\n<p>Conversely, LBSU is 11-12 at home this season and just recently defeated UCLA on the road, 5-1.</p>\n<p>“We won at Blair Field two years ago, and it felt like that was the only time we ever did it,” Checketts said. “It is such a tough place traditionally, and wins are harder to come by so we need to be able to execute.”</p>\n<p>One thing the Gauchos definitely have going for them, however, is their starting pitching.</p>\n<p>Taking the mound on Friday will be senior right-hander Stevie Ledesma, who pitched a complete shutout game his last start, earning the win.</p>\n<p>On the year, he currently has a 2.16 ERA, which is the second-best mark in the entire conference.</p>\n<p>Usually a Friday starter, sophomore righty Chris Lincoln has been pushed back to Saturday as he tries to recuperate from a back issue that forced him out of his last start earlier than he would’ve wanted to.</p>\n<p>His early exit resulted in a loss for the ‘Chos. On the year, Lincoln’s 2.35 ERA is the third-best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>At the plate, sophomore Tommy Jew has been as hot as anyone, as he still has the best batting average on the team with a .301.</p>\n<p>However, if the Gauchos want sustained success it needs bigger contributions from guys like sophomore Armani Smith, who has done a lot better as of late.</p>\n<p>One point batting under .200 on the year, Smith is now batting .221 and since April 22 has gone 9 for 23 at the plate with 10 RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Despite his struggles this year, it’s clear Smith is still very much putting in the effort — a sign of good things to come.</p>\n<p>“He’s hit for more power on the year with more doubles and homers, but he has also struck out more,” Checketts said. “He’s swung the bat better lately, and he’s a kid you root for. He’s a great kid so we are happy to see that.”</p>\n<p>Like Santa Barbara, Long Beach State is also 7-8 in conference play and tied for sixth place, but they seem to have more confidence due to their four-game winning streak. Overall, the Dirtbags boast a 22-26 record on the year.</p>\n<p>In their last four wins, LBSU has won by an average of 3.5 runs.</p>\n<p>At the plate this season, Long Beach State currently has the worst batting average in the entire league, sporting a .243 average, but in the last four games has managed a much better .315 at the dish.</p>\n<p>The Dirtbags also have two players currently batting above .300 on the season, which is always a nice luxury to have. Even more impressive is one of those two players batting over .300, junior Clayton Andrews, is also the team’s star pitcher.</p>\n<p>Andrews currently sports a 2.58 ERA on the season which is the best mark on the team and fifth-best total in the conference while his 92 punchouts are the second best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>This is the Rohnert Park native’s first season with the team; before this he spent two years playing at Cabrillo College where he was awarded with the league’s player of the year honors.</p>\n<p>In his last start against UC Riverside Saturday, Andrews had a career day as he went registered four hits, tying his career high, with one RBI and struck out a career-high 13 batters in eight innings of work.</p>\n<p>Due to his pitching performance, Andrews earned Player of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be a tough one for the Gauchos, but at the end of the day, if they even want a chance to make the postseason, they need to win.</p>\n<p>This team has grown a lot over the year, and no matter what happens, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p>“There has been some growth and maturity with this team through our failures, and these next two weeks are going to be very challenging, but we have talent here. We just have to play hard, quality baseball, not worry about that outside stuff and we will be fine,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on LBSU for game one at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 11 at Blair Field.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 10</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
