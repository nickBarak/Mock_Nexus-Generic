The Gauchos will host Sacramento State on Saturday as part of the annual BracketBusters games.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the matchup with an 8-17 overall record on the season, while Sacramento State has a 12-12 mark on the year. With only eight players healthy for Saturday’s game, Santa Barbara will try to rebound from a multitude of injuries and get back to winning.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really good for us just to get a chance to get some wins under our belt,” sophomore center Alan Williams said. “Hopefully we can get this win Saturday and keep the momentum going until the end of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara fell 54-45 on Wednesday night to UC Riverside, its second straight loss and fourth straight defeat on the road. The Hornets, meanwhile, are also losers of two straight games entering Saturday’s contest at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to use this as an opportunity as a prep game just for the next games coming up, and obviously we’re going to try to get the win too,” freshman forward Taran Brown said. “We all need to get together at a time like this, get our heads right and just keep grinding through it.”</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to win, they will have to improve upon its recent shooting performances as the Gauchos shot under 26 percent from the field against Riverside. Big Al led UCSB with 15 points and 12 rebounds but was only 4-18 from the field.</p>\n<p>“It all comes down to poor shooting,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “During the game, you shoot the ball at [26] percent, you’re going to have a hard time beating anybody. If you throw on top of that turning the ball over … it still makes it difficult when you do those things.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward John Dickson leads Sac. State with 13.3 points per game and is second on the team with 5.8 rebounds per game. A key to the game will be how the depleted Gauchos slow down Dickson in the paint.</p>\n<p>With only eight players available to play during their last two games, the Gauchos have struggled with injuries all season. There is an outside chance that junior guard Kyle Boswell, the team’s best shooter, could return by Saturday from a shoulder injury, but the odds are still unlikely.</p>\n<p>“Is our confidence shaken at this time? Sure, we’re not playing very well,” Coach Williams said. “I think it’s a residue of how beat up we’ve been and that we’ve really been holding it together with different pieces every game and different guys. It’s a house of cards and it can tumble, and unfortunately [Wednesday] night, offensively, it just tumbled.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s BracketBusters game against Sacramento State is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/","id":640,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[639,638,637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Joe Pasternack and the Gauchos Storm Into the T-Dome for Exhibition Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Gabe-vincent-cutout.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Gabe-vincent-cutout.png?resize=683%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Head Coach Joe Pasternack and the UCSB men's basketball team are set to make their debut with an exhibition game this Saturday.

The Acton, Calif., native had season-ending knee surgery during what would have been his junior season in 2015-16, one year after averaging a career-high 14.5 points per game and leading the conference in three-point makes with 85 of them.</p>\n<p>King II averaged 3.7 points and 2.6 rebounds per game with the Wolf Pack and 12.1 ppg and 6.5 boards per match in two seasons at Brown. King II graduated from Nevada last year with a degree in business.</p>\n<p>Both players are expected to start and contribute right away to a Gaucho team that struggled in all facets of the game last season. Joining them will be a plethora of returners, including seniors Gabe Vincent, Alex Hart and Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the former, Vincent is coming off an ACL tear that ended his season back in February. Before that, the shooting guard was one of the few bright spots UCSB could count on as, before missing the final eight games of the season, he was averaging 14.8 points per game along with 3.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per match.</p>\n<p>Despite the injury, the Stockton, Calif. native is still a well-respected figure in the Big West basketball community, as he was the only Gaucho named to the Big West All-Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>Due to his barely getting back into game action for the first time in a while, expect Vincent to have his minutes limited Saturday, as well as maybe the first few games of the season, before making a return to the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>For Canty, this is his second year as a Gaucho after transferring from community college. Like Vincent, Canty was getting better with each game throughout the season, at one point leading the Big West in rebounds, but was sidelined for all of conference play due to academic ineligibility.</p>\n<p>In 10 games last year, the big power forward averaged 10.2 points per game along with 7.0 boards. This summer, Canty has worked incredibly hard in both the classroom and the weight room, as he is eligible to play, and he has slimmed down considerably in hopes that it can help diversify his game.</p>\n<p>The last senior on the team, Hart, was one of the main threats for the Gauchos when Canty was ruled ineligible to play. Last year, Hart, who plays center, played in all 28 games for UCSB, averaging 7.6 points per contest. He was able to really improve in his final eight games of the year, scoring in double figures four times, including a season-high 16 points twice.</p>\n<p>Other notable players to watch out for will be sophomore guard Clifton Powell Jr., who was a sparkplug off the bench for the ‘Chos last season, sophomore guard Max Heidegger, who had an average slash line of 7.6/2.1/1.4, and junior forward J.D. Slajchert, who brings tremendous energy every time he is out on the court.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the court, Fresno Pacific will also be looking to improve off of an average season that saw them go 7-20 on the year but 7-13 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Sunbirds were tapped to finish 11th in the PacWest Conference and had no players named to the preseason all-conference team.</p>\n<p>Under second-year Head Coach C.J. Haydock, FPU will look to rely on senior center Oliver Herting, who only averaged 6.5 ppg and 1.6 rebounds but is one of the few remaining members, as the team has added nine newcomers to the squad this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match won’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of the score, as they are expected to bull over their opponent, but what will be important is how they look doing it. With many new pieces in Santa Barbara, it will be interesting to see how Pasternack could make it all work.</p>\n<p>The team has been predicted to finish sixth in the conference this season. However, if some of these additions can work, maybe this team’s ceiling is higher.</p>\n<p>First impressions are everything, and Pasternack has stated he wants the Thunderdome to be packed this season. Winning is one of the first steps he can take to ensure it is.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on FPU in an exhibition match at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 4, at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 2, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Needless to say, growing up in such a small and isolated place certainly helped to shape Brown into the man and player he is today.</p>\n<p>“Everyone kind of knows everyone and that’s kind of how it is in Wyoming,” Brown said. “If you’re a pretty well-known athlete, you kind of just know everyone because it is a small place. There’s not a lot of violence there, so it’s a great place to grow up. I really love Wyoming, especially my hometown.”</p>\n<p>Making it as a basketball player was not always the only dream for Brown. He played football and participated in several track events including hurdles, high jump, long jump and the triple jump up until his sophomore year in high school. Had he continued playing either sport, Brown has no doubt he could have played either at the college level.</p>\n<p>“I quit just to focus on basketball,” Brown said. “I was actually pretty good in both of those and went to state in both of those. It would have been fun to be a college wide receiver, but I think my passion is definitely basketball.”</p>\n<p>While his 6’8” frame would have certainly proven deadly as a wide receiver, where Brown truly excels is in his athletic ability. His ability to shoot and run the floor like a guard with the build of a forward helped him to establish a future beyond playing high school ball at Campbell County High School.</p>\n<p>“It was tough, especially since the population is not too high in Wyoming. There is under a million people, so it’s hard to get recognized for basketball,” Brown said. “We didn’t have [Amateur Athletic Union], so my traveling coaches when I grew up, we all went to tournaments all over just to get my name out there.”</p>\n<p>During high school, Brown stood out on a national stage despite playing in the least populated state in the country. Taran was named a McDonald’s All-American as well as the Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Wyoming. He was also a two-time All-State selection and led Campbell County to a state title during his senior year.</p>\n<p>“[Assistant] Coach [Matt] Stock (a Wyoming native) really deserves credit on [bringing Taran to UCSB] because of the Wyoming connection,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He had heard a ton about him and been in touch with him and had been mailing him stuff. I watched him play in Vegas, and from that, that’s when we really started recruiting him. Once he got out here and saw Santa Barbara and all that compared to where he grew up, it was a really nice opportunity for him.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the charm of Santa Barbara lured Brown, a sociology major, away from competing schools such as Colorado State and Wyoming. Last season, Brown, along with Coach Williams, decided to redshirt in order to save a year of eligibility. That decision allowed him to focus on transitioning from Wyoming life to the faster California lifestyle he wasn’t used to.</p>\n<p>“To see his transition was funny. When he first got here he didn’t know a lot of things, didn’t know a lot of California terms, didn’t know a lot of places to go eat and never heard of a lot of things,” sophomore guard T.J. Taylor said. “It was very fun to see him transition from a little Wyoming kid to now, almost a superstar.”</p>\n<p>This season, Brown has shown just how dangerous of a player he can be. With six games left in the regular season, he has already broken the school’s single-season record for three-pointers made in a season by a freshman with 52. That number ranks seventh in the entire Big West Conference. His 11.7 points per game rank third this season for UCSB and are first amongst freshmen in the conference.</p>\n<p>Brown has also shown to be versatile aside from scoring, ranking second on the team in rebounds (5.7), steals (0.9) and blocks (1.0), third in assists (2.2) and first in minutes per game (31.1). He has eclipsed the 20-point mark three times this season and registered a career-high 22 points in only his second game as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“His potential is to the sky, it’s just on him to have the mentality to come into the gym everyday, really working to get better and really believing in himself as well,” Taylor said. “I think he will, with the push from the coaches and his teammates. He can be a superstar. I’m excited to see him grow and become a better player.”</p>\n<p>With his future looking bright at UCSB, Brown’s dreams of playing basketball as a profession are slowly taking shape. Who would have thought that a small-town kid from snowy northeastern Wyoming would one day become the big man on campus at sunny Santa Barbara?</p>\n<p>“Ever since I was five years old, I just started with a ball and had travel leagues from first grade all the way until now. It’s always been my thing and I just really love to play,” Brown said. “When I’m on the court, it just feels like I’m in the right place. I’m going to bring basketball as far as I can. I know I have a ways to go, but anything can happen, so I’m going to keep pushing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays at UC Riverside tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of February 20th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/","id":638,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[637,636,635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Prep to Host First Place Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_WBasketball_011013-12.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_WBasketball_011013-12.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At just 3-7, the UCSB women’s basketball team has struggled at home this season.

On the other hand, UCSB comes off a tough 65-56 loss to rival Cal Poly in which UCSB was unable to stop Cal Poly’s offense.

Martin averages a double-double, ranking third in the Big West in scoring and second in rebounding with 15.3 and 10.0 per game, respectively. She also shoots 50.6 percent from the field, good enough for third place in league.</p>\n<p>“[Martin is] a very talented and a physical post player, who has a variety of moves on the block, so a key for us is obviously stopping her,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We have a lot of different ways we’re going to guard her and we have to stick to our defensive principles.”</p>\n<p>Playing the same position for the Gauchos, Underwood averages 11.8 points per game, tenth in the conference, and nine rounds per game, good enough for fourth in the Big West. Shooting 49.3 percent from the field, she also ranks fifth in field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>The last time these teams met up in Hawaii, the Gauchos came away with a 51-50 win that handed the Rainbow Wahine their first home conference loss. UCSB was clutch down the stretch with junior guard Nicole Nesbit making a lay-up with 12.5 seconds remaining to give Santa Barbara a one-point lead. On the other end, the Gauchos came up with the defensive stop and earned its first come from behind victory of the season.</p>\n<p>“That game we willed ourselves to a win,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We made big stops and we had players that stepped up and were willing to take the big shots.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff against Hawaii is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 21st 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier/ Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/","id":639,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[638,637,636],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
