Now is the time when we start seeing which teams are real contenders for an NBA title and which teams can pull through to earn those final playoff spots.</p>\n<p>Here’s a look around the NBA and where teams stand in the playoff picture:</p>\n<p>In the Eastern Conference, it would be no surprise if Miami returned to the NBA finals. The Heat has won 15 straight games, hitting its stride at the right time, going into playoffs, just like it did last year. And despite how difficult it is to win back-to-back MVP awards, LeBron James is the best option for the award at the moment after becoming the first player to go six games averaging 30 or more points while shooting over 50 percent from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A little further down in the standings is Chicago. Derrick Rose has yet to play this season after tearing his ACL in the playoffs last year. When he will return remains a mystery, but against the Pacers three days ago, Rose returned to the bench, giving his team hope. Without Rose, I don’t see the Bulls going too far into the playoffs, although they have raised some eyebrows this year, currently in fourth place without their leader.</p>\n<p>Not to say that the squad isn’t still extremely talented with players like Joakim Noah and Luol Deng. My worry with Rose is that he could come back too early. There’s been a lot of pressure for him to return and knees can be extremely vulnerable after serious injuries like an ACL tear. If it were me, I’d take my time coming back.</p>\n<p>If there’s one team that I think will contend with Miami, it will be Indiana. The Heat isn’t a big team, preferring to play with a small lineup and put James at the power forward and has struggled when other teams pound the ball inside.</p>\n<p>Last year, Indiana and the Heat matched up in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Miami took the series 4-2, but it didn’t come with ease. This season Indiana is an undefeated 2-0 against the defending champs and both victories have come by at least 10 points.</p>\n<p>Paul George is having a stellar year, averaging 17.6 points and nearly eight rebounds per contest. Yet, the Pacers have plenty of great players around him with David West, George Hill and Roy Hibbert all averaging double digit scoring. With Danny Granger coming back from injury, I’d expect to see Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>\n<p>In the Western Conference, San Antonio currently has the best record in the NBA at 47-14, but it will be interesting to see how the Spurs do down the stretch. The team just lost Tony Parker, who certainly was a candidate for MVP, due to an ankle sprain and will be out for four weeks. Parker was having arguably the best season of his career, averaging 26.1 points, 8.3 assists and four rebounds per game. He was also shooting about 54 percent from the field. The team will need its veterans like Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan to step up.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Spurs were the leading team in the west going into playoffs as well, but were beaten by Oklahoma City in the Western Conference Finals. Personally, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the same happen again this year. San Antonio is full of veterans that know how to win, but the athleticism and young talent of OKC will be too much to handle for the Spurs.</p>\n<p>Finally, fighting for a playoff spot in the west has been Houston. They’ve currently taken the seventh spot in conference, primarily due to the outstanding play of James Harden. The ex-Thunder player now has the spotlight on him. There’s no Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook to overshadow him and Harden has delivered.</p>\n<p>While I thought he might struggle due to the fact that opponents could key in on him, Harden has stepped up his game. He’s averaging 26.2 points per game compared to 16.8 points per game last season. He’s also dishing 5.7 assists per game, over two more than last year. Houston might not be a contender for a title, but Harden had certainly solidified himself as one of the great scorers in the game today.</p>\n<p>With a full season this year, injuries will certainly come into play as many teams start to get worn down from the taxing schedule. My prediction is that there will be a rematch of last year’s NBA finals with Miami taking on OKC. That wouldn’t be too bad as fans would once again be treated to two of the best players in the game going head to head.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/","id":652,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[651,650,649],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Fullerton Upsets UCSB, Snaps Second Longest Winning Streak in Nation","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s an old saying that says, “All good things must come to an end.” The UCSB women’s basketball team had its 40-game winning streak against Cal State Fullerton snapped last night as it fel...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There’s an old saying that says, “All good things must come to an end.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team had its 40-game winning streak against Cal State Fullerton snapped last night as it fell to the Titans 46-38.</p>\n<p>With the loss, the Gauchos drop to 12-15 overall and 8-7 in the Big West.

The Gauchos got off to a horrible start, turning the ball over six times in their first nine possessions. As a result, the Titans took an early 9-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled offensively, failing to score until there were just under 12 minutes left in the first half, and as a result entered halftime down 23-16. The 16-point half was the Gauchos’ worst start to a game this season.</p>\n<p>To open the second half, Santa Barbara finally began to climb back into the game. Two free throws from junior guard Nicole Nesbit brought the score within three at 27-24, but the Titans responded with a 7-0 run to extend their lead back to 10 points. However, Santa Barbara continued to fight, closing the gap to four points with four minutes to go.</p>\n<p>While Fullerton left the door open for UCSB, the Gauchos were unable to take advantage of their many opportunities to win the game. After coming within four, the Titans turned the ball over. However, Santa Barbara returned the favor. The Titans then missed on the front end of a one-and-one opportunity, but UCSB gave the ball back to Fullerton once again with an offensive foul.</p>\n<p>Unable to make a shot that would bring the Gauchos within one possession, Fullerton eventually took advantage. Down the stretch, the Titans went seven for eight from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Despite outshooting the Titans 32.6 percent to 24.4 percent, UCSB sent Fullerton to the free throw line 25 times. The Titans converted their opportunities, shooting 84.0 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Nesbit was the only player for the Gauchos with more than six points, tallying a game-high. For Fullerton, sophomore guard Chante Miles and junior guard Alex Thomas paced the team tallying 11 points each.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to forget about tonight’s loss as it travels to UC Riverside Saturday. At 11-15 overall and 4-11 in the Big West, the Highlanders have lost five straight; however the last time these two teams played, Riverside upset the Gauchos 45-42.</p>\n<p>UCSB turned the ball over 17 times leading to a 20-6 points off turnovers advantage for Riverside. Junior center Natasha Hadley dominated down low, scoring 20 points and giving the Highlanders a 20-6 advantage in the paint.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, their lead was just two with under a minute remaining. Nesbit drew a foul, but made just one of her free throws, exhibiting the Gaucho’s horrible night from the charity stripe as they shot 56.2 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>While Hadley gave the Gauchos fits in the last matchup, senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham has made her mark on the conference as the strongest offensive threat, leading the Big West in points per game with 18.2.</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50436\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50436\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/","id":649,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[648,647,646],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to Hawaii Looking to End Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The moments that define a young basketball team are how it responds in the face of adversity.

Santa Barbara sits in eighth place in the conference standings, a mere half game ahead of Cal State Northridge for the final slot in the postseason tournament.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, meanwhile, is coming off an 84-50 victory over Northern Arizona that snapped a two-game skid. The last time these two teams met in Santa Barbara, junior forward Christian Standhardinger went off for career-highs with 31 points and 16 rebounds in a 78-73 Hawaii victory.</p>\n<p>“We definitely can’t let him get off,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve got to do a better job on all their guys inside. We got our rear ends handed to us inside on the glass and we have to fight harder, block out better, and be more physical in keeping them off the glass.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will potentially be without one of its top scorers in junior guard Kyle Boswell, who is sitting out with an injured shoulder. Sophomore center Alan Williams, the team’s leading scorer, rebounder and shot blocker has also only played in two games since returning from a sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have to see how we come out and play and practice,” Coach Williams said. “It was actually kind of impressive after a nine hour travel day they came out and practiced really well. Practice was good, they were feisty, they were competitive; things we want to see.”</p>\n<p>Practice may have been a little too feisty though, as Brown cracked his nose during Tuesday’s practice in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I’m definitely in some pain right now,” Brown said. “I’m going to have to wear a mask tomorrow in the game, but I can’t let it hold me back, I’ve got to keep going. At this point we don’t think I broke my nose.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara struggles to rebound from a slow season and tries to clinch a spot in the postseason tournament, maybe a trip to Hawaii is exactly what the Gauchos needed to get them back on track.</p>\n<p>“I like the idea of coming out to Hawaii, getting a smile on our faces and just getting some positive energy,” Brown said. “I think that’s a big thing we need right now with this type of season.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50404\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50404\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/","id":650,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[649,648,647],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns Big West Tournament Berth","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball-file-photo.jpg?resize=400%2C305&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team proved Saturday they could win the pivotal games that can make or break a season.

Big Al scored 24 in the second half alone and finished 11-20 from the field and 10-13 from the free throw line on the night.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to get in the rhythm of things and to get a little bit of my swagger back,” Big Al said. “It was really fun to be out there; the energy was great from the team.”</p>\n<p>In his first game back from injury, junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle scored a season-high 10 points off the bench with eight coming in the second half. Junior guard Kyle Boswell also scored 18 for the Gauchos, a game after scoring a career-high 27 in Thursday’s loss at Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“The first half, we just missed a lot of layups and open shots; we just couldn’t quite get it in sync,” Coach Williams said. “In the second half, Al, Boswell and Keegan Hornbuckle—the three of them really just took the game over.”</p>\n<p>UCSB used the trio to overpower the Matadors, scoring 54 points in the second half alone. Freshman guard Michael Bryson added 14 points on the night, but kept the Gauchos in the game early with 13 of those points coming in the first half.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we knew we were in control of the game,” Big Al said. “There were just a couple of plays in the first half that could have had us with a lead at halftime. We were just focused in the locker room knowing that we could go out and win this game, all we had to do was execute a little better and we did that as a team.”</p>\n<p>The performances from Boswell and Hornbuckle were especially significant for UCSB as both players are coming back from injuries that left the Gauchos with a depleted squad of only eight eligible players.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara looked strong in its victory, outrebounding the Matadors 34-33, committing fewer turnovers (14-13) and shooting a higher percentage from the field (50.8-42.6 percent).</p>\n<p>“Getting back healthy at this time of the year is really important for us,” Big Al said. “Once we get back to full strength, we’ll be a really tough team to beat. We’re looking forward to carrying on this momentum we have right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home to face Cal State Fullerton on Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/","id":651,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[650,649,648],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
