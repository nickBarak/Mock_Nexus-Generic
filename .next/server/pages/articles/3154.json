The 4,270 square-foot space, which may open as early as next month, will also include community resources for UCSB students including a computer lab as well as rooms for studying, recreation and tutoring.</p>\n<p>Cori Lantz, A.S. external vice president of local affairs and a fourth-year political science major, said the new office will provide the student body amenities that can currently  only be found on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to do more outreach to students and families in Isla Vista,” Lantz said. “This is a really amazing resource that [I.V.] needs.”</p>\n<p>Megan Shumate, Isla Vista Community Relations Committee chair, said the annex will also provide a meeting space for A.S. entities that currently don’t have a residence.<br>\n“Our committee deals just with Isla Vista and its relations on and off campus so we’re really excited to finally have a home in Isla Vista,” Shumate said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Community Affairs Board Chair Amanda Galvin said the Family Literacy Program will greatly benefit from the space. Galvin also said the tutoring service will now be accessible to more I.V. families as its new location will be an ideal middle-ground between families and student tutors.</p>\n<p>“This program is helping elementary students through tutoring given by UCSB students,” Galvin said. “We’re moving all our offices for it out to the new space.”<br>\nLantz said the money devoted to the project will circulate back to the community.</p>\n<p>“The money that’s paid towards rent will go back into a public agency so the money has been committed to the development of Isla Vista,” Lantz said. “It could go towards lighting or repaving of streets so the aesthetics of Isla Vista will be improved.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC and C.A.B. each distributed $24,000 for the new space, while A.S. Legislative Council dispensed $3,000 and the Student Commission On Racial Equality distributed another $1,273. Nearly $33,000 of annual funding is needed to move ahead with the project, and the external vice president of local affairs office and 12 other A.S. BCCs are seeking additional funding from Finance Board for that amount.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/","id":3154,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3153,3152,3151],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke","biography":"Not available","articles":[3005,3075,3120,3123,3154,3482],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Potential Policy Change Spurs Council Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council discussed at length a bill to modify the upcoming spring A.S. elections during last night’s four-hour meeting.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students Legislative Council discussed at length a bill to modify the upcoming spring A.S. elections during last night’s four-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>Council members debated the logistics of the bill, including vague wording in the resolution, its committee membership requirements and endorsement policy. The board ultimately tabled the measure until next week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of Internal Affairs Jake Elwood said it’s crucial for the council to reach a decision by their next meeting.</p>\n<p>“The deadline to make changes to this year’s elections committee is week five [of winter quarter],” Elwood said. “If we do not vote by then, the changes will be made for next year.”</p>\n<p>However, Representative at Large Chloe Stryker said she couldn’t support the bill as written because of its lack of clarity. Stryker said its vague language could potentially violate the A.S. Legal Code’s bylaws.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of things in this bill that I think are a Judicial Council hearing waiting to happen,” Stryker said.</p>\n<p>The board also discussed the resolution’s proposed candidate endorsement procedure. As specified in the bill, if a current elected officer endorses a candidate for the 2011-2012 academic year, the officer will be penalized and lose pay, among other consequences.</p>\n<p>“For endorsements, I don’t think that you should be using your position to endorse a candidate,” Stryker said. “But does that mean that an officer cannot post ‘vote for this person’ on their Facebook without losing their honoraria and having to pay back tuition?”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the endorsement clause of the bill does not specify what constitutes “official support” for a candidate.</p>\n<p>“I hope that we can get some clarification from the elections committee,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>Representative at Large Miles Freeman, on the other hand, said he supported the bill because the electoral process is in dire need of change.</p>\n<p>“I know this is a complicated bill,” Freeman said. “This was a bill essentially drafted, created and compiled by the elections committee and I think we should rely on the elections committee to make this decision.”</p>\n<p>However, On-Campus Representative Alfredo del Cid said the council must first discuss the matter with the elections committee before making a decision.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/","id":3151,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3150,3149,3148],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Additionally, the board discussed potentially videotaping council meetings, Governor Jerry Brown’s proposed 2011-2012 budget and efforts to create a student-run cooperative café in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Lambda Theta Alpha and Lambda Theta Phi members John Salas and Lidia Rivas, respectively, requested $1,350 to fund t-shirts and food for an upcoming event encouraging low-income high school students to pursue higher education.</p>\n<p>Rivas and Salas said UCSB sociology assistant professor Victor Rios agreed to speak at the event for free if organizers bought a copy of one of his books for each participant.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez said the arrangement would violate University policy.</p>\n<p>“UC faculty cannot be paid for speaking anywhere in the UC,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>After reviewing its budget records, A.S. Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht discovered that the association had already funded the group $1,100 in November. The council eventually allotted an additional $500 for food and $168 to donate eight of Rios’ textbooks to the four participating high school libraries.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov submitted a proposal to record legislative council meetings. Tzankov said the recordings would not only create more transparency within A.S., but also prevent campus media outlets from misquoting council members.</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez said recording meetings could deter council members from voicing their opinions.</p>\n<p>To avoid calling attention to closed meetings, Tzankov said the council could post recordings after the meetings in lieu of releasing a live feed.</p>\n<p>“Last year there were … issues that came up and we had to go into a closed meeting and so I don’t know if a live feed is the way to go,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>According to University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid, recording meetings could make the council more accessible to the student body.</p>\n<p>“To us, A.S. is this great thing, but to many students it seems like this exclusive group,” Del Cid said. “[Recording meetings is] definitely better. … Most students don’t want to go through lines of minutes.”</p>\n<p>The proposal was ultimately tabled for future consideration.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Off-Campus Representative Kaily Burton said the council is considering funding a student-run restaurant at the former site of On The Side on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>Burton said the restaurant, which would be modeled after a similar venture in Berkeley, would sell locally grown organic foods.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
