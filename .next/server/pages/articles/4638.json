Fire Engine 11, which was staffed with one Captain, one Paramedic/Engineer and one Paramedic/Firefighter, was dispatched and responded from their station located at 6901 Frey Way (at Storke Rd.) in Goleta. Upon arrival, Firefighters were met by several agitated bystanders stating that the subject had cut his arm and needed help. Firefighters donned the appropriate protective equipment and approached the subject, where they found a combative male victim, around 20 years of age, being restrained on the ground by Sheriff’s Deputies who had arrived on scene prior to our arrival.</p>\n<p>Our Captain and Engineer assisted with restraining the subject, who was extremely combative, while the Paramedic/Firefighter began treatment and worked to control the bleeding. An American Medical Response (AMR) ambulance arrived on scene. The subject was placed onto a back board and restrained with soft restraints to prevent further injury to himself or to first responders. He was then transferred to the AMR ambulance and transported without delay to Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Our Firefighter/Paramedic rode to the hospital in the ambulance to assist with patient care. The Captain and Engineer remained on scene, at the request of Sheriff’s Deputies, to assist with cleanup at three different locations on Abrego Road. There was a large amount of blood on the street at these locations, which presented a biological hazard. The areas were cleaned with the use of Septisol and copious amounts of water.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Firefighters pride themselves in their professionalism while working with law enforcement and AMR to provide the highest standard of patient care. Our members treat every emergency with urgency and professionalism. Engine 11’s crew on October 11<sup>th</sup> included an experienced team of Firefighters and Paramedics. Every effort was made to provide the very best care and life saving measures for this young man.”</p>\n<p><em>For the original allegations:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting on Wednesday, alleging emergency personnel mishandled the events leading up to Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>Hoover released the following statement regarding the events of Sunday morning:</p>\n<p>“On 10/11/2015 at approximately 4:40 a.m., SBSO Dispatch received a call for medical emergency in the 6700 block of Abrego Road for a report of a male subject bleeding from the arm and running around in the street screaming for help. SBSO Deputies, Fire, and AMR responded to assist.</p>\n<p>The victim, Andres Sanchez, suffered from a large laceration around his right arm, near the elbow.  The injury was later determined to have been caused by the victim punching his arm through a plate glass window.  Sanchez was combative and displayed symptomology of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Sanchez was restrained on a backboard and transported to Cottage Hospital Emergency Room by ambulance. Based on witness statements at the scene, Sanchez had struck the apartment window with his right arm and began running around, yelling and acting strangely.  He was bleeding profusely. Several of the witnesses attempted to restrain Sanchez and provide first aid. Sanchez’s roommate believed Sanchez may have ingested some type of synthetic drug, possibly LSD or K2.</p>\n<p>While at Cottage Hospital, Sanchez became unresponsive.  Advanced life-saving efforts were attempted, but were unsuccessful.  Sanchez was pronounced dead at approximately 6:51 a.m.  Next of kin was notified by Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital Emergency Room staff. The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is conducting a death investigation to determine cause and manner of death.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said fire and medics were dispatched “within seconds” of Melgoza’s 911 call, and deputies arrived within three and a half minutes.</p>\n<p>“I was able to pull up the dispatch log and I can see exactly when the call came in and when it was given to fire and medics,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses’ claims that a translation service was not available following the incident is “totally false,” and deputies do not notify families of tragedies by phone.</p>\n<p>“Foot Patrol has many translators. We have staff and we have deputies that speak Spanish,” Plastino said. “We would never call someone on the phone … we call down to the agency that’s in charge of that area.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he wants to provide “100 percent transparency” regarding the events preceding Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>“I am so absolutely positive that we did everything absolutely right,” Plastino said. “I want everything to go to the press because I feel so confident in how we handled this.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said deputies’ demeanor on scene is often misconstrued as harsh.</p>\n<p>“At the moment of the crisis we are the ones that have to do the job, and in order to do that, you have to put up your brick wall … your mental armor to deal with the situation at hand,” Plastino said. “That can come across to some people as being uncaring, unfeeling, unemotional, unsympathetic at the moment.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said although he does not agree with Ariana, Baker, Hernandez, Melgoza and Ramirez, he thinks they are asking “good questions.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely 100 percent glad that they are asking these questions, that they are questioning the way things are being done, because things aren’t always being done the way they should be,” Plastino said. “In this incident, I disagree with their perception of things.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses alluded to false events, causing Sanchez’s family “unwarranted grief.”</p>\n<p>“I could care less all day long if they want to question law enforcement,” Plastino said, “but when it affects the family and their grieving process for their son who’s died, then it’s an exception, because it causes them more grief.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, deputies are trained in basic first aid, but are not equipped to handle severe injuries.</p>\n<p>“The first aid kit that we carry is enough to help somebody with a stubbed toe, like a small cut,” Plastino said. “We’re trained in basic first aid, which is something anybody can go get … but it’s not advanced life support … we can apply pressure, we can do CPR.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said it is “frustrating” for deputies to be first to arrive at the scene of a medical emergency because they do not have the means to provide the care needed.</p>\n<p>“We want to assist, but we’re powerless because we don’t have the skills, the equipment or everything else that needs to be done during a major incident like that,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he agrees with the witnesses that all police vehicles should contain an emergency kit.</p>\n<p>“Here is where we need to do a better job — there was a criticism that we did not carry a first aid kit,” Platino said. “That’s gonna be addressed … Every single one of [our] cars needs to have a first aid kit.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, one of the two IVFP deputies who responded had a flashlight when approaching Sanchez, but the allegation that a deputy carried a baton is “absolutely untrue.”</p>\n<p>“One of them got out with a flashlight, and the flashlights are not very big, so I don’t know how that could have been construed as a baton. The batons are long,” Plastino said. “That flashlight was never used in any way to restrain the young man, it was never used against anybody that was a bystander. It wasn’t used at all.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is “very impressed” with the witnesses’ response when Sanchez approached them.</p>\n<p>“There was a woman who was assisting, trying to keep him down, because he was trying to get up,” Plastino said. “Hats off to those who assisted him because with blood loss, the more worked up you are, the more blood you can lose. They were absolutely doing the best job they could as bystanders.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the deputies’ behavior alleged in the witnesses’ accounts can “not be tolerated,” and he asks for evidence that such misconduct occurred.</p>\n<p>“Whoever is propagating that kind of nonsense, I would ask them to come forward and provide proof of it,” Plastino said. “If there is proof of it, we need to have a full-blown investigation.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, officers will meet with the Sanchez family today to ensure the two deputies did everything in their power when addressing the situation.</p>\n<p>“The sheriff is meeting actually with the family today and going to show them everything so that they can rest assured that we handled their son properly,” Plastino said, “that he was not mistreated in any way, that no part of this was mistreatment of their son.”</p>\n<p>[<em>Correction: This article previously stated San Diego deputies notified the Sanchez family of Andres Sanchez’s death; however, it was Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital that did so.

Gaskin was President of West Valley College for three years prior to her appointment as SBCC’s President in July 2012. Gaskin focused on a variety of issues including fiscal transparency for the college, campus facility modernization and addressing SBCC student concerns in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said her decision to retire was partially due to SBCC’s positive accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for the Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, a major focus during her presidency was to close the student achievement gap between different ethnicities.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received several funds to experiment and launch innovative programs to close that gap or disparity,” Gaskin said. “We’ve also ramped up our academic counseling support. We had one of the higher ratios in the state when it came to student academic counseling ratios.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of SBCC Jack Friedlander said Gaskin smoothly transitioned into her role during her first year of presidency.</p>\n<p>“She came in and calmed the waters at the college and in the community and helped reestablish relationships internally and externally,” Friedlander said “She didn’t come in with a preconceived agenda”.</p>\n<p>According to Friedlander, the recruitment process for a new president is in its early stages.</p>\n<p>“We have a profile of what the ideal candidate would bring,” Friedlander said. “Particularly, people who apply write an essay to write about how their experiences and characteristics align with what we’re looking for and how they would deal with the challenges our campus is facing.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Students President and second-year business administration major Isaac Eaves said Gaskin listened to student voices on campus.</p>\n<p>“She always had the time to communicate with students and build a connection,” Eaves said. “She’s been working hard to make sure that we have a voice because in the past — there’s been a lot of micromanaging from the Board of Trustees and down.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Student Trustee and political science and sociology double major Tyler Gibson said Gaskin has addressed issues regarding “Measure S,” a bond proposition authorizing funds to improve campus facilities.</p>\n<p>“In 2014, we tried to improve [SBCC’s] infrastructure,” Gibson said. “[Gaskin] addressed concerns because of Measure S. We’ve tried to strategize ways to continue to be an effective community campus while keeping the faculty and students in mind.”</p>\n<p>Gibson said many students were surprised about Gaskin’s announcement.</p>\n<p>“Most people that I’ve talked to said ‘No way,’ ‘Wait when? Next year? Didn’t she just get here?’” Gibson said. “She’s somebody I look up to, so it was very shocking to see her announcing about retiring.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said one of the defining moments in her career as president was the events of May 23 last year in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If there was one moment that has been set apart from all the others, it is the tragic loss of lives in Isla Vista,” Gaskin said. “It is the antithesis of what anyone wants from our students. Learning and teaching is a truly special endeavor, and for something like that to happen is an assault to the core of who we are.”<br>\nGaskin said she hopes to travel after her retirement.</p>\n<p>“I want to have the time to travel,” Gaskin said. “I’ve never taken a trip in the 35 years in September or October. It would be so unusual to travel then.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/","id":4636,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[4635,4634,4633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Halloween Parking Restrictions and Noise Ordinances Discussed at City of Goleta Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The City of Goleta hosted a community meeting to discuss residential parking permits and noise ordinances for Halloween weekend in Isla Vista Thursday evening at Goleta City Hall.

At the meeting, community members discussed possible solutions to these issues, mainly temporary noise ordinance and parking permits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Police Department Lieutenant Mark Signa said the influx of vehicles during Halloween weekend has affected locals in past years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parking has been a difficult thing for people who come out into the area and park in Goleta and take up valuable space that the residents are using,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said the City of Goleta and UCSB have collaborated to ensure that parking is available for I.V. residents and the students through a temporary permit system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta area’s restricted the parking to those who have permits, and the permits are given to the residents in the area,” Signa said. “Each resident, from Hollister Avenue to Southern Limit and from Cannon Green Drive to Storke Road, get two permits and can request more at the Neighborhood Service Department.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said the City of Goleta will implement a parking restriction from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Oct. 30 to Nov. 2, with restrictions on parts of Del Playa, Sabado Tarde, Trigo, Camino Del Sur, Camino Pescadero and El Embarcadero starting at 5 p.m. on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, UCSB will offer discounted campus parking permits for those who wish to purchase one in preparation for Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What they’ve done to mitigate the problem with students living on Del Playa is that they’ve offered the students an opportunity to buy night weekend permits at a reduced rate, so they actually get a permit they can use for the rest of the year,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino said a noise ordinance will help ensure parties to not reach unmanageable levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been studies done that show that the sooner you shut down the music the sooner the party is over,” Plastino said. “As you close that gap between the times you allow it to the time you shut it down, you lessen the amount of drunken violence and fights that break out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, the parking permit program and noise ordinance are intended to make Halloween a local event for I.V. residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What this has been very successful at doing is instead of creating large, open parties with two, three or five hundred people showing up and music blasting, it’s now smaller contained parties, local parties, where students are having parties with just their friends, smaller groups, hence less alcohol, less problems,” Signa said. “By keeping it local it stays contained.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department Lieutenant Butch Arnoldi said many people who visit I.V. for Halloween do not respect the local community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately people that are not from the area come up here and think that’s it free game for all kinds of assaults, physical assaults and sexual assaults,” Arnoldi said. “This is not the old west, people can’t come here from out of town and brutalize our people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said approximately 200 law enforcement officials will patrol I.V. during Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement for Isla Vista is going to consist of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s department, UCSB police department and we’re each going to have different areas that we’re going to be patrolling,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta Neighborhood Services and Public Safety Director Vytautas “Vyto” Adomaitis said the City of Goleta developed a parking permit program with community input and has received “overwhelming support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the feedback we got from the residents was, in fact, to do something about having permit parking in the area to help keep all of the outside visitors who come into the neighborhood and flood the area with vehicles,” Adomaitis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adomaitis said the City of Goleta will keep working to decrease the impact of Halloween weekend in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ll be reviewing these measures periodically and methodically like we do after every event,” Adomaitis said. “We find out what went wrong, what needs to be adjusted.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><div
