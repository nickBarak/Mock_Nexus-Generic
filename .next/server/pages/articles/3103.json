Students can then use these lists to find contact information for books they need.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the student-run textbook marketplace is a kickoff for what the A.S. Office of the President hopes will eventually become an institutionalized series of regular student-run buy-back events at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a process, but still, it’s something we’re going to start now,” Armen said. “Buying books is expensive, and we have no control over return for books. There’s pressure with costs everywhere, so this way students can make profits instead of having to go through a middleman or to the university.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board are also engineering a student-run textbook website structured similarly to the textbook advertising hosted on many Facebook group pages.</p>\n<p>“We’re tying to make a mechanism that is like Facebook, but student-run,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>UCen Bookstore employee and third-year biopsychology major Debbie Gee said the marketplace threatens to redirect students and revenue away from the campus’s main textbook retailer.</p>\n<p>“It might detract from the amount of traffic in the UCen,” Gee said. “When people buy textbooks they also buy other things, like pens, pencils and notebooks. So if they buy from somewhere else, sales in general could potentially go down, too.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the book buy-back will allow students to bypass bookstores and exchange reading material in a much more efficient manner.</p>\n<p>“The problem is, when we consistently go to the university or small companies, books can get expensive because you don’t have other options,” Armen said. “This came out of student organization. We’re creating innovative ideas when the university is putting a burden on our backs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Elizabeth Dang said the traditional process of buying and reselling schoolbooks is time-consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>“When I sought out the buying back process, I would find that buyback prices would be for only 20 percent of the book, which is practically nothing,” Dang said. “And textbook costs are ridiculous — especially since we only use it nine weeks, and in most of my classes we only read two chapters out of like 500 pages.”</p>\n<p>While the bookstore does offer the option to rent books for a cheaper price, Gee said a successful student-run textbook marketplace could end up being a worthy competitor to the university.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure how the prices at this thing will compare to bookstore prices, but lots of students are struggling with finances, and this could detract from sales if it ends up being cheap, efficient and well-run,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>According to Armen, Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board hope the textbook marketplace fuels widespread questioning and analysis regarding the causes of high textbook prices and promotes further student organization to address shared financial issues.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we’re here: inspiring students, making [them a] part of the solution on campus and showing the impact of having things student-run,” Armen said. “We are a community sharing resources.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 9th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Though Student Regent-designate Cinthia Flores was origi- nally scheduled to attend, she was unable to make an appear- ance due to scheduling conflicts.</p>\n<p>Stein, a UC Berkeley graduate student who is working toward a law degree and a master’s degree in public policy, said the event’s goal was to encourage students to become more involved in and informed about the decisions made at local, statewide and national levels with regard to UC policies.</p>\n<p>“First and foremost, I give voice to student concerns at the highest level of UC administration … I empower students to solve their own problems,” Stein said. “We have to engage our administrators, and what that means is that Student Regents are one part of a much larger student movement that is sort of attacking from all angles.”</p>\n<p>Stein said while protest is often an effective method of communicating with the board, much more is needed to fully engage the administrators and promote widespread change. Some potential ways to take a more noticeable stance include holding advocacy protests on several campuses and lobbying at regents’ meetings, Stein said.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Sophia Armen, it is crucial that students recognize their voice on the Board of Regents and work for further representation in committees that allocate large amounts of funding and other resources to the university.</p>\n<p>“It is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of education that we as students in the UC, who number over 200,000, only have one student vote on the Board of Regents that raise our fees and affect our daily lives,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>Stein said Prop. 30 was a huge victory for students, but only a temporary solution for the coming cuts to the UC system. According to Stein, students must re-involve themselves in advocacy efforts for the upcoming 2013-14 year and any future year in order to avoid huge tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>“As a result, students have to go back to Sacramento to begin the process of lobbying for another tuition buyout,” Stein said. “We passed Prop. 30 through student voter registration and student voter turnout … now we have to go back and lobby to negate a tuition increase for the second year in a row.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, ensuring the transparent use of funds generated through Prop. 30 is one of many causes that contrib- ute to the importance of “fighting for our right to education as a public good.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science major Sydney Bennet, a campus organizing director for the A.S. External Vice President of Student Affairs, said students need to take action by getting involved with campaigns that speak directly to California legislators and create more opportunities to lobby in support of education.</p>\n<p>“We represent students on statewide, national and UC level, and our goal is to make sure education remains afford- able and accessible,” Bennet said. “This [event] was just the first step.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of November 19th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/","id":3100,"author":{"id":203,"name":"Jennifer Chang"},"related":[3099,3098,3097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Each brigade disperses medical supplies to a village until replaced by the next brigade the following month.</p>\n<p>This year’s UCSB dispatch will take place June 17 to 27 and focus on two different communities in Ghana’s Abuakwa region.</p>\n<p>UCSB GMB Treasurer Paola Cardenas, a fourth-year biology major, said $2,000 of the student funds would supply malaria medication and the rest would finance other medication including painkillers, antibiotics and vitamins, while participants would personally cover all other travel costs.</p>\n<p>“Everything comes out of our own pockets including airfare … this is a complete volunteer trip,” Cardenas said. “It’s not just a group of kids going on a vacation … It’s a group of kids going to help people [and] to make lives better.”</p>\n<p>The 10-day trip includes medication distribution, patient consultation, door-to-door greetings and a public health day educating local communities about water filtration systems and the importance of sanitation.</p>\n<p>GMB Vice President of Fundraising Steven Tilem, a fourth-year microbiology major, said the local chapter is being given the honor of representing the U.S. as one of the first groups involved in the new Ghana program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is one of the lucky few United States programs that has the opportunity to be a foundation for this new community,” Tilem said. “It is a great opportunity, and it is all based on the fact that we have a great reputation not only with excellent funding and support from our school and community, but because of the dedication of students and UCSB in general.”</p>\n<p>GMB President Jamie Miller, a fourth-year biology major, said the club ultimately seeks to better the living standards in the Ghanaian communities.</p>\n<p>“Our primary goal is to go to these communities that do not have adequate access to health care,” Miller said. “In Ghana, we will organize medications to distribute and go door-to-door to identify problems so that we can [ultimately] prevent them.”</p>\n<p>The board fully funded the group in the amount of $4,625 with the stipulation that it host an A.S. awareness event.</p>\n<p>According to Cardenas, all students can apply to participate in UCSB’s Global Medical Brigades. Last fall, 40 students were selected to go on the Ghana trip.</p>\n<p>In addition, 15 local healthcare professionals traveled to Ghana, including UCSB faculty member and alumnus Dr. Jason Prystowsky.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/","id":3101,"author":{"id":201,"name":"Christine Cha"},"related":[3100,3099,3098],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Discuss Hurricane Relief, I.V.

The Senate also accepted Off-Campus Senator Cory Wheeler’s resignation and decided who would be responsible for finding his replacement.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Andrew Soriano proposed post-Hurricane Sandy clean-up efforts, emphasizing the gravity of the disastrous situation and citing similar fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>“The hurricane pretty much devastated the East Coast,” Soriano said. “I know in the past we have organized efforts with things like Hurricane Katrina.”</p>\n<p>Soriano’s idea was met with support and enthusiasm. Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia suggested a blood drive to help aide shortages in areas heavily affected by the storm.</p>\n<p>“There has been a blood shortage because of so many people being wounded … blood banks have been affected as well,” Segovia said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Segovia also encouraged a partnership with Red Cross to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Miya Sommers said the United States was not the only country to take a beating from Sandy, reminding the Senate that some other affected countries do not have the infrastructure to bounce back quickly after such a storm.</p>\n<p>Another proposed project dealt with Isla Vista’s lack of appropriate lighting. Off-Campus Senators Alex Choate and Kaitlyn Christianson are working on a resolution to make I.V. brighter, which they defended at the meeting. Christianson said the resolution, which entails filing a work order for each defunct bulb in I.V., is a simple solution to a pressing issue.</p>\n<p>“[This is] something that we’ve needed for years and it [has] not [been] able to get done because of funding,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Senators discussed Proposition 30 and the consequences that would accompany its failure, as they have at every meeting for the past few weeks. There will be continued efforts to advocate Proposition 30’s significance to the student body before Tuesday’s election.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/","id":3102,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3101,3100,3099],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
