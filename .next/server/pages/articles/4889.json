They are now 9-11 on the year, 0-4 in GCC play while Pacific improves to 15-5 on the year and a perfect 4-0 conference record.</p>\n<p>Play began in the first quarter where the Tigers wasted no time opening up the scoring after freshman Luke Pavillard scored within the first two minute, giving Pacific the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the final 30 seconds of the first, it was both the Gauchos and Tigers putting up some points on the board. Senior Shane Hauschild gave UCSB their first point of the match on a powerplay goal good for his 29th goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Tiger Engin Ege Colak was able to answer back with three seconds left, scoring a goal for the 3-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Hauschild answered back again two seconds later scoring his second goal of the night and only leaving the Gauchos one point behind the Tigers 3-2 at the end of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>After giving up the lead early into the second quarter, Pacific went on to dominate the rest of the period.</p>\n<p>The Tigers were able to score five unanswered goals as the team was able to take control both offensively and defensively as the team did not give up a goal since scoring in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge for Pacific was redshirt senior Ben Stevenson who had two goals and two assists in the second, giving his team the lead at halftime, 8-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to close the deficit to just three goals in the third quarter, but it appeared to be too little, too late as Pacific was able to slowly inch away from the Gauchos during the match, ending the third period still ahead five, 11-6.</p>\n<p>Scoring the Gauchos only goal of the fourth quarter was freshman Chad Nelson and the team went on to lose 14-7.</p>\n<p>The short-handed effort from the Gauchos has been admirable as the team has been able to play well despite the indication from the record, Coach Wigo is certainly hoping to get some of those players back into the pool and playing with his star attacker.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are hoping for a similar result in their upcoming match against Pepperdine next Friday, where the team could possibly pick up their first conference win.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead next week, the team needs a win next week against Pepperdine, the team that bounced the Gauchos out early from the Golden Coast Conference Championships last season should give the team some much-needed success headed into the conference tournament which begins play November 17th.</p>\n<p>“The guys are motivated and team morale is still good, the guys are fighting. We know anything can happen in the tournament and we just want to get some momentum next week and get a good game against Pepperdine so we could feel good about ourselves headed into the tournament,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>The No. 10 UCSB Gauchos will play the No. 8 Pepperdine Waves on the road at 7 PM PST on November 10th.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79529\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79529\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/no-10-gauchos-drop-fourth-conference-match-of-season/","id":4889,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4888,4887,4886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 5 Men’s Water Polo Hopes To Bounce Back Vs.

Those Trojans, then, will jump into Campus Pool on Saturday with revenge and a return to the historical order in mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USC, now 7-2, has rebounded from that earlier loss. The Trojans are 5-1 since then, with wins over No. 6 Cal, No. 8 Long Beach State and No. 18 Princeton. The one blemish came at the hands of Pacific in a 16-15 shootout to open up last weekend’s SoCal Invitational.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior driver Jacob Mercep leads the Trojans with 23 goals so far this year, while senior driver Marin Dasic isn’t far behind with 20. Both players have scored multiple times in seven games this season, but only Dasic was able to pull that off against the Gauchos the first time around with two goals in the match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limiting those two engines of attack again on Sunday will be crucial to a UCSB victory. The Gauchos forced other players to hurt them, and none proved capable of dealing a killing blow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those other players was sophomore driver Hannes Daube, who took eight shots in the first matchup, converting only once. Daube is USC’s third-leading scorer and has scored in seven different games, so limiting his opportunities will be another Gaucho priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know we need to stop Daube and Mercep,” UCSB Head Coach Wolf Wigo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also look to replicate their success against USC’s goalkeepers, particularly sophomore Nic Porter. Porter, who boasts 10.29 saves and 9.14 goals allowed per game, was in goal for the first matchup and unable to stop much of what the Gauchos threw at him with just four saves against the 13 goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trojans have largely alternated goalies this season, however, so UCSB may be facing off against junior Vaios Vlahotasios in the cage instead of Porter. Vlahotasios has been less successful statistically with 8.6 saves and 9.2 goals allowed per game and was the main recipient of the Pacific onslaught last season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whichever Trojan is in goal will be doing his best to prevent a repeat performance by junior attacker Cole Brosnan. Brosnan buried USC with five goals the first time around, including two in the third quarter to help push the Gauchos out to a decisive lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am sure they will focus a little more on Cole this time,” Wigo said. “But that will just open up our other shooters so we don’t have any problem with that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brosnan has kept up the scoring since the first USC game. The junior scored eight times during the SoCal Invitational, with one goal in each game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cole has a great shot,” Wigo said. “And if you do not mark him tight, he is deadly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will have a home crowd at their backs on Sunday, something they didn’t have in La Verne the first time they faced the Trojans. That should provide something of a boost to UCSB, which is 2-0 in Campus Pool so far this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It will be a home game with a huge crowd,” Wigo said. “ … [We need to] just play relaxed and confident. Let the crowd do what they do and don’t get distracted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This UCSB team has never had to overcome defeat and keep moving forward, so Sunday represents a unique challenge. That both losses came by razor-thin margins to elite teams can provide some solace, and Coach Wigo is confident in his team’s ability to press on:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we played great and lost in the final minute by one goal against top teams … It has not really affected us. We will continue to stay with our game plan and hopefully execute that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday, the Gauchos will get the chance to prove their coach right. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Following Halle’s goal, the game featured minutes of rough fouls and the crowd giving the referees some advice and it looked like the chaos was helping neither side.</p>\n<p>Finally, at 2:40 to go, Kyle Trush converted to give the Anteaters the 9-7 lead.</p>\n<p>A penalty shot from Shane Hauschild with 2:16 left gave Hauschild his 5th goal of the day and moved the Gauchos within one.</p>\n<p>With 1:22 remaining and only down one, Reed Cotterill finessed an over the shoulder shot from set to tie the game 9-9. The senior added the exclamation point by facing the crowd and pumping his fist, giving the Gauchos momentum and a comeback hope.</p>\n<p>A focused defensive stand by UCSB ended in a deflating goal by Irvine’s Lovre Milos to give the Anteaters the 10-9 lead with 34 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t come up with a tying goal in their last possession, giving Irvine the victory.</p>\n<p>Justyn Barrios had another big day in the cage, despite being scored on ten times, as he had 11 saves. A few of those saves were one-on-one with an opposing player when the sophomore goalkeeper came up huge for the Gauchos in preventing the score from getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>For a young UCSB team that’s still without two of its best players, the loss can’t be too much of a surprise or even a deterrent. Last year’s Gold Coast Conference championship was won by Pepperdine, a 4th seed in the tournament, so the Gauchos have opportunities remaining.</p>\n<p>“We know there are hard games down the stretch, and I think this game showed any of these games you can come in and win. Whether we win or lose these games, we just want to be playing well,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said, “I thought we played well.”</p>\n<p>Although it still has a chance for postseason glory, this is the UCSB team that has now lost 5 straight. With or without their two better players of Ivan Gvozdanovic and Boris Jovanovic, the Gauchos will have to make some quick adjustments.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos haven’t been too far off, as they’ve shown signs of dominance earlier in the season. UCSB has a considerably young roster and so obviously the consistency that comes with a mature team hasn’t been prominent late in the season, but Friday’s tightly-contested matchup with Irvine showed promise for UCSB’s developing players.</p>\n<p>“We fought back a couple times and I was really proud of the effort of the guys,” Wigo noted, “a lot of the younger guys played some great minutes.”</p>\n<p>They’ll just have to channel that energy and follow the leadership of Shane Hauschild as they prepare to play their final games of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s penultimate match will be at 7 p.m. on Friday, November 3 against Pacific at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

That is why it is important to remember that despite “norms” or assumed expectations, at the end of the day any level of intimacy must be on the terms of your partner and you. Figure out what you want out of a relationship. That could be anything from knowing you want to get married and have five kids after dating six months to knowing you exclusively want to have one-night stands. Defining for yourself what you want will help you avoid a potentially negative or even harmful situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the physicality of hooking up, make sure you know your boundaries, what you are comfortable with and what you are willing to try, and be sure to have communicated with your partner about their boundaries as well. Remember that while hookup culture on a college campus can be uniquely lecherous, it can also be surprisingly insightful. Keeping open lines of communication can not only help keep you safe, but it can also allow you to more comfortably explore your sexual boundaries as well.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How do I stay faithful to my long-distance boyfriend? It’s so hard sometimes!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I do believe everyone is capable of maintaining a long-distance relationship, I do not believe long-distance relationships are for everyone, for a variety of different reasons. That being said, I believe the first step to being faithful in a long-distance relationship is ensuring that both your partner and you are 100 percent committed to the relationship as it is. Relationships in and of themselves are difficult, and being physically separated only adds to the opportunities for confusion, miscommunication and stress. If both of you are not committed to one another and to addressing your issues as they arise, I don’t believe it would be worth it to stay together because you will just be hurting one another in the long run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you and your boyfriend have discussed your commitment to one another, I think it would be beneficial to set aside a few times a week when you will Facetime or have a phone call with each other. Obviously you can talk more than what is scheduled, but ensuring that you have dedicated time to each other regularly is a more tangible representation of your commitment that will help you both stay connected. I also think that it is important for your partner and you to discuss how you will handle conflict when it arises. Whether you decide to address it immediately or to give yourselves a few days before discussing, putting a concrete plan in place will help you avoid simply putting issues off that could be detrimental to the relationship. Long-distance relationships may be the ultimate test of a relationship, but keep in mind why you’re staying committed and that the distance is only temporary.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Hi AJ – how do I tell my best friend I’ve been in love with her for five years? I don’t think I can stay silent anymore :(</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falling in love with your best friend to some extent seems almost inevitable. Despite all efforts to maintain a completely platonic relationship, the lines of intimacy blur when you love someone. She knows you love her, but she doesn’t know the way you love her. You have to be completely honest with her and also with yourself. What is it that you want from the relationship and what are your intentions in telling her? While I do believe you should be honest with her about your feelings, that does not necessarily mean that you have the intention of changing the relationship right now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When friendship turns into something more, I think there is always the fear of losing the relationship. Keep in mind that this may catch her off-guard or she may not even skip a beat. Regardless, you should let her know that you care about her and that you want to communicate about how the feelings may affect your relationship. In the chance that the feelings aren’t reciprocated, remember that it is OK to take some time to process and move forward, but that you should let her know what you need to continue the relationship as friends.</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?
