Many of us can easily spend four years here without leaving I.V. and campus to see the amazing things happening in that wider community in Goleta and Santa Barbara. Though many of us will only be a part of it for four years, it has so much to offer if you’re willing to put yourself out there. This past weekend’s New Noise Music Festival Block Party was a great opportunity to experience the community and witness the unique cultures we are lucky to be around.</p>\n<p>A friend and I had heard the Block Party was the highlight of every year and were particularly excited about Saturday’s show, which featured headliners STRFKR and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Making sure to get there early to see the openers — because you never know what you might discover — was a good decision. The Block Party consisted of a single stage and about a dozen booths representing different parts of the community, along with a Beer Garden, made use of by plenty of Santa Barbarans of age. With a little bit of time before the first of the four bands came up, we decided to visit the different booths before checking out KOLARS.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73523\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"341552210\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73562\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73523\" data-attachment-id=\"73523\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/6o2a9331/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"6o2a9331\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73523\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"KOLARS by Riley Esguerra\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9331.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73523\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOLARS by Riley Esguerra</p></div>\n<p>What’s astounding about seeing little-known openers is that you can never predict what you might get. In that way the tarot reading we’d gotten earlier at the KCSB booth had prepared us for the experience of a KOLARS show. The band features only two members, Rob Kolar, the guitarist and lead singer, and Lauren Brown, perhaps the world’s only full-body percussionist. As the two came out to start the set, Brown stood on a large sideways drum surrounded by two more drums and a singular cymbal as Kolar took his spot behind the microphone, guitar in hand. The song started and the drummer in the futuristic silver dress started tap-dancing on the drum as part of the percussion! Right then, I knew that this was why I loved seeing openers I know nothing about. Not only did KOLARS have a unique style of percussion, but their overall sound was spectacularly unique as well. The band clearly drew inspiration from many artists, from their futuristic outfits and electronic embellishments to the Elvis-esque growl of Kolar’s voice to the cover of “King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1” by Neutral Milk Hotel. With so many inspirations from all over the rock-electronic spectrum, the result was something unique but familiar and irresistibly danceable. Talking to the group after their set as they walked around and visited the booths, we learned the L.A.-based band loves Santa Barbara and had performed at the festival before as part of their previous band. After discussing Kolar’s inspirations, we asked Brown how she keeps up her stamina to dance and jump on a drum for 45 minutes each show. Brown says she’s able to do it because performing “isn’t tiring at all because it feels like I’ve just finished a good run.” The drummer’s “runner’s high” was just an example of how much energy the band projected out into the crowd during their set. In the end, we walked away with a USB featuring all of the band’s music. I knew then that New Noise wasn’t like any festival I had been to before. Something special was happening here, and that was community. This wasn’t a massive festival where you are separated from those performing by an endless sea of people. Anyone could go up and talk to them because they were just people enjoying the community like the rest of the festivalgoers.Before the next set, we enjoyed some cheap but delicious fully loaded hot dogs and checked out a few different booths selling unique hats, giving away organic, gluten-free energy bars and fighting for more ethnic studies programs in the area.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Even if the band’s sound wasn’t in your normal wheelhouse, you couldn’t deny they brought a lot of energy to the stage as lead-man Travis Hawley danced and got the crowd involved. Several times, the various band members joined the drummer in percussion, including an impressively coordinated routine between Hawley and the lead drummer Rico Rodriguez. The San Louis Obispo-based band clearly had a lot of chemistry together, as they started jamming together in high school. We had a long conversation with the lead singer about songwriting and the band’s fairly intense practice schedule. It was so cool that the up-and-coming band didn’t think they were above having a real conversation with fans, and it just reinforced for me the community aspect of New Noise.</p>\n<p>As day faded to night, Unknown Mortal Orchestra performed their unique psychedelic brand of indie pop-rock that I’ve constantly been playing on my Spotify since the concert ended. The band combines the soulful voice of lead singer, guitarist and front-man Ruben Nielsen with the beautiful keyboards of Quincy McCrary and the rhythms commanded by Amber Baker and Jake Portrait on drums and bass, respectively. The spectacular thing about their set was that the band descended into improvised solos between songs that went on for minutes and sounded like a jam session from a hallucinatory dream world. While the band might not be the most danceable out there, UMO’s music is perfect to simply close your eyes to and marvel at the remarkable skill and psychedelic nature of their unique blend of styles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73527\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1398288583\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73562\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73527\" data-attachment-id=\"73527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/6o2a9708/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"6o2a9708\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73527\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"UMO by Riley Esguerra\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6O2A9708.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UMO by Riley Esguerra</p></div>\n<p>The Block Party ended with a final performance by headliner and indie electronica dance group STRFKR. The headliner finished the night off perfectly as the crowd lost its inhibitions and danced the night away. The group, led by Joshua Hodges, clearly had a lot of fans as the crowd went wild for their songs with dancing.</p>\n<p>As we walked back to the bus, I reflected on the community I was a part of here in Santa Barbara. I felt a strange kinship to the people I had just enjoyed the festival with as the crowd eventually dispersed to different bars and restaurants down State Street. Soon enough we caught our bus and the festival was over, but the experience I had will stick with me. As we ate at Freebirds to cap off the night, I felt a connection to Santa Barbara and like I was a part of its community, and I knew I wouldn’t miss the next chance to see what else the city could offer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/new-noise-serves-up-a-dose-of-sb-culture-tunes/","id":6770,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6769,6768,6767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes","biography":"Not available","articles":[134,976,1365,5769,6148,6684,6708,6735,6770,6782,6789,6792,6809,6827],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Odell Fox Folk it Up","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/odellfox.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/odellfox.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Thomas Mannell covers Americana at SOhO.

The parents caught up and chatted, the young adults brought their friends and dates and the little kids tried their best to maintain interest. The band — the reason for the get-together — sang comfortably, strummed confidently and spoke casually in front of an audience comprised heavily of their friends and friends of friends. As a friend of a friend myself, I was honored to be let in on this secret fan club, getting to speak with not only other sworn members but the band members themselves.</p>\n<p>Raphael Odell Shapiro, Jenner Snow Fox and their manager/fiddler/angel-voiced songstress Lauren Tronick played a lyrically driven, bluegrass selection of melodies. Between the three of them, they incorporated a harmonica, a violin, a mandolin, a classic acoustic guitar and a gorgeous Gretsch resonator into their repertoire. Fries got cold and beer got flat as the band captivated the crowd, jumping from solo works to unreleased material, comical songs to hard-hitting ballads and selections from their album to covers of their esteemed predecessors.</p>\n<p>The songs from their only album, <em>Moon Shiner EP</em>, were the most well-known to the crowd, as seen by the more dedicated fans unwittingly mouthing the words to hits like “Waiting Game” and “One at a Time.” Because of this, one would expect an aspiring, relatively unheard-of band with a fully stocked merch table set up in the back of the room to be pushing their album as much as possible. This was not the case. As Raph put it, “Songs are a very funny piece of art, because it’s something you create, and you have to play it over and over and over, and it’s not really good until you’re sick of it … and sometimes an older song will just catch you by surprise and be awesome.” Accordingly, some of the best songs of the night seemed to be the less tired-out ones not found on their album.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One such song was “GGD”, a skeptical plea with the clever lyrics, “I don’t give a good God damn because I know that God don’t give a damn about me” and “I ain’t no rabbi, buddhist, preist or pastor, but I know I got a tendency to preach.” This was immediately followed by an a cappella cover of “House of Gold”, a song so wholesomely Christian it could’ve been featured on the “O Brother Where Art Thou” soundtrack. This polar pairing left listeners unsure of what stance was being taken, or if a stance was even being taken at all. In fact, the only stance the band took very strongly the whole night was on the unquestionable superiority of Gatorade to Powerade in their aptly named song, “Gatorade.”</p>\n<p>As far as their future goes, the band’s next move is to finish their tour and set up a new home base in Austin, TX, one of the most prominent music meccas in America. They’ll spend a few months embedding themselves in the music scene there and will then return to the “boring” jobs they have when not on tour: guiding white water rafting tours down the Tuolumne River near Yosemite (Fox) and teaching at an art school and exploring in Alaska (Odell). They will begin touring again in July, starting at the Tall Tree Music Festival in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>Odell Fox, as demonstrated by their SOhO performance, had all the genuine charm of an underappreciated, up-and-coming band. No money-grubbing gimmicks. No ulterior agenda. No bullshit. Just a couple of good friends playing good music with a good attitude. The treasure-hoarding hipster part of me wants them to remain underground, eternally unknown and underrated except to a proud few. The pretentious hipster part of me wants them to blow up so I can tell everyone that I knew them first. But what I feel is truly amazing about Odell Fox is that they’ll enjoy themselves either way. As they put it, “even if you play shitty shows you’re at least on a pretty cool road trip with your friends.” They therefore must be feeling fantastic,­­ because their SOhO show was everything I could’ve hoped for and then some.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/odell-fox-folk-it-up/","id":6767,"author":{"id":722,"name":"Thomas Mannell"},"related":[6766,6765,6764],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Preview: GoldHub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The instrumental DJ plays at The Hub on April 7.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69250\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69250\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"947142357\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69249\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69250\" data-attachment-id=\"69250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/goldroom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=800%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=250%2C203&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?fit=888%2C722&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-e1459509012693.jpg?resize=800%2C650\" alt=\"Courtesy of nesthq.com\" width=\"800\" height=\"650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>nesthq.com</em></p></div>\n<p>On Thursday, April 7, UCSB’s very own Hub is in for a funky night filled with good vibes as DJ, producer and songwriter Josh Legg — better known as Goldroom — will be taking the stage, along with special guest Matt DiMona. Goldroom is particularly unique from other DJs because his career began when he was part of the band NightWaves. Since then, Legg has taken on the pseudonym Goldroom and found much success by providing his fans with amazing and relaxing sounds.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based artist sticks close to his roots, as his name stems from the city itself. Legg sees LA as one big gold room, and this is what influenced him to choose the nom de plume. Legg’s first few songs, “City Girls” and “Morgan’s Bay,” were heavily influenced by LA and in a way were odes to the beautiful city. Being an artist from such a big city is difficult because one is surrounded by hundreds of other young people with big dreams. Nevertheless, Legg found his way in the music industry and has brought along some friends. After working as a solo project for some time, Legg turned Goldroom into a trio when he was joined by keyboardist/vocalist Mereki Beach and drummer Nick Sandler.</p>\n<p>After transforming into a live three-member ensemble, Goldroom’s sound has evolved into a mixture of tropical and upbeat production accompanied by soothing and melodious vocals. Since 2013 his performances have evolved into live shows involving four members, adding in a bassist. Although his sound is categorized as dance music, Legg integrates instrumentation and vocals that lead to a much more passionate and ardent feeling than the work of typical EDM artists. His distinctive melody has paved the way for him as he has made notable appearances at some of the most prestigious music festivals and venues in the landscape; for example, he joined reputable artists such as Flume, Mac DeMarco and Toro Y Moi at last year’s FYF festival.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Goldroom is on his Pacific Coast Trip tour right now, performing in places ranging from Portland to Santa Barbara to Indio. Luckily, Josh Legg took some time from his busy schedule to answer some questions from the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Unlike some artists that get caught up in fame and materiality, it is clear that Legg has a genuine passion for what he does. Legg digs deep into his creative process and makes sure to keep his vibe unlike that of many other DJs.</p>\n<p>“I like to think of myself as a songwriter that happens to make dance music,” he stated when asked about the lyrics in his music.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that he produces his beats, Legg also holds the vocal component of his music near and dear to his heart.</p>\n<p>“Songwriting is the core,” says Legg. “The lyrics allow me to convey a message.” It is evident that he finds the connection between him and his listeners to be a vital aspect of his creative process.</p>\n<p>Legg sticks close to his roots and constantly finds himself going back to where he started: playing an acoustic guitar.</p>\n<p>“I was always playing acoustic guitar and writing songs. When I was younger I was always in band.” In fact, he also says that whenever he gets writer’s block what seems to help him gain some motivation is going straight to his acoustic guitar. Nevertheless, Legg urges others to “make a challenge for yourself.”</p>\n<p>His songwriting has definitely progressed since his first EP, and Legg shared that this is surely going to be noticeable in his upcoming debut album.</p>\n<p>“My songwriting has gone to a new level,” claims Legg.</p>\n<p>Not only have his songwriting abilities advanced, but he has also found himself embracing more performers in his live act. Throughout his entire career he has only had a six-piece group once, but he feels as if this helps in making his performance much more electrifying.</p>\n<p>“Performing live is normal for people who are performing other people’s songs,” states the songwriter. “This adds a unique flavor from other artists.”</p>\n<p>Rather than being close-minded, Legg believes that Goldroom is about trying new sounds and taking risks. “When I close my eyes, this is what I pictured Goldroom to be,” states Legg.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Santa Barbara will have the opportunity to experience the sensational and tropical vibes that Goldroom has to offer at The Hub on April 7. Doors will open at 8:30 p.m. and students can buy their ticket at the A.S. Ticket Office for $14 or $21 at the door.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/preview-goldhub/","id":6768,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6767,6766,6765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Frank Ocean, ‘Blonde’ and the Visual Album","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/frankoceanfinal-1.jpg?resize=355%2C185&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/frankoceanfinal-1.jpg?resize=357%2C185&ssl=1","description":"Using the phrase “long-awaited” would be trite in welcoming the release of Frank Ocean’s third album.

The reclusive writer, singer and producer has been clamored after since last summer when fans were promised new material in the form of a project called Boys Don’t Cry. Over a year later, it has since been rechristened Blonde, 60-minute opus streaming exclusively on Apple Music.</p>\n<p>To accompany the album, Ocean also distributed a zine in pop-up shops located across the country, including his native Los Angeles. He gave the title Boys Don’t Cry back to the extensive, glossy magazine, which itself resembles a concept more modern-art than DIY. Not only did he give us Blonde and Boys, but we also have Endless, a sparse black-and-white visual album full of covers and older material, also exclusive to Apple Music.</p>\n<p>It’s been four years since Frank Ocean put out the ethereal, superb channel ORANGE. Four years have passed since the media buzz, the praise for his openness about his sexuality and the Grammy nods. It’s left many wondering: Was he working on this the whole time since then, or did he take time off, then finish this all at once just to please everyone?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Either way, both Blonde and Endless are beautiful, there’s no denying it. So the question is, where does Frank Ocean fit into music now? Apple Music dubs his music as pop, but it all has an obvious inclination toward soul. He may even near avant-garde territory with the release of the zine and the visual album.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the music accompanying the visuals has the same sophisticated feel. “Nikes,” the cerebral, genre-bending opening track to Blonde, is gorgeously intricate, and it also serves as the album’s lead single. It is a reminder that Ocean is not only a brilliant songwriter, but also a master at bending the intricacies of song structure to his will. The song, like the rest of the album, is free-floating, almost formless, but somehow still has a definitive shape.</p>\n<p>However, there is a distance that Ocean puts between himself and the listener, felt most in his use of cold beats and vocal manipulation. On songs like “Pink + White” and “Seigfried,” we still can catch a glimpse of the sensitivity that his earlier work was built around. “Godspeed” has the same gospel elements favored by enigmatic artists Chance the Rapper and Kendrick Lamar. “Ivy” — the only track on the album that has a traditional chorus — is about a first love.</p>\n<p>For the most part, though, that’s where the warmth seems to stop. “Less morose and more present,” he raps on “Seigfried,” almost invoking a mantra for the collection of songs.</p>\n<p>Blonde, Endless and Boys Don’t Cry almost seem as though they were commissioned, brought about by incessant requests for new material from a hungry fanbase.</p>\n<p>Now that the reality of new material from Ocean is actually real, what’s left is something that doesn’t evoke the same emotion as a record as raw as channel ORANGE. Unlike channel ORANGE, however, this distance has allowed him to create something outside of himself. The visual album is a concept that wouldn’t have even been possible four years ago, before the rise of streaming services.</p>\n<p>Artists were not pushing the boundaries of the relationship between music and moving pictures in the same way. Beyoncé would not have released her eponymous fifth album or Lemonade; Kanye West would not have released his headline-inspiring worldwide screenings of his “Famous” short film project. The rumors swirling around the release of the album itself were virtually all generated by the internet. Music does not exist now in a vacuum from technology or visuals.</p>\n<p>Bob Dylan’s Blonde on Blonde cover is an out-of-focus portrait of Dylan himself and was one of the first double albums in history. Frank Ocean’s Blonde cover features a portrait of the singer covering his face with his head down. Both were instant classics upon their releases and feature some of the most anticipated music of their times.</p>\n<p>Frank Ocean, like Dylan or other great artists of any era, is not just creating music that does not sound or look like anyone else’s. He moves beyond that, creating a world of his own that exists for us, too.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.
