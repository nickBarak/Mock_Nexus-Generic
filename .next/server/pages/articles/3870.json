The five warming centers, including the Isla Vista location at the University Methodist Church, have already been activated 27 out of the planned 50 nights across the county, compared to 13 nights this time last year.</p>\n<p>Farr said addressing the needs of the homeless residents could not be put off due to predictions of increasingly poor weather over the next several months.</p>\n<p>“People need to be cared for sooner, rather than later, so that they don’t get sick. In some cases with the homeless, they will die on the street if they’re not cared for,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer chaplain, also said the homeless are at risk in the winter weather.</p>\n<p>“We may not have snow and frostbite here, but it gets pretty close to it, and sooner or later that takes a toll,” Hedges said. “That’s why so many of the folks … died way before, some of them in their late 20s.”</p>\n<p>The warming centers, active Nov. 15 through Mar. 31, provide shelter from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on nights when the overnight temperature drops below 35 degrees, there is a 50 percent chance of rain predicted for two consecutive nights or a 50 percent chance of temperatures less than 40 degrees for two consecutive nights. According to Farr, the day shelter program was developed to provide a companion piece to the warming centers.</p>\n<p>“That system has worked very well, but there was a concern that that wasn’t enough, that we needed something during the day,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>The day shelters will likely be located at Earl Warren Showgrounds and at Santa Maria’s Minami Center in North County. While these locations are less easily accessible than the five warming centers across the county, Farr said a form of transportation may be provided to shuttle homeless residents to the day centers.</p>\n<p>“We did work with some transit providers, like Easy Lift, to say if we’re able to get these day shelters up and running. If people need assistance in getting there … the people at the warming shelter at night when they’re released at 6 in the morning, we could provide a shuttle service from the warming center locations to the closest day center,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Junior Anguiano, Community Affairs Board hunger/houseless co-coordinator and second-year film and media studies and psychology double major, said it is important to provide transportation for the homeless.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them have everything they own on a bike, and you can’t just throw that on a bus and go downtown and have to make that trek,” Anguiano said. “There is no established shelter in I.V. other than the warming center.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while Reverend Frank Schaefer has been very gracious to open up the University Methodist church as a warming center, the issue of shelter for the homeless individuals in I.V. is about more than just “ducking in to get a dry place to sleep.”</p>\n<p>“The solution really is finding a place, helping us find a place, agitating with us to find a place,” Hedges said. “Also, volunteering with things like Doctors Without Walls, student health outreach, SWIPES.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said he also encourages students, when they feel safe, to reach out to homeless individuals in I.V. in small ways.</p>\n<p>“If nothing else, maybe buying somebody a cup of coffee, giving them a justification for being in the Starbucks,” Hedges said. “You know, you see some guy there cold and wet, buy him a cup of coffee.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said he wants UC Santa Barbara to “step up as a neighbor” in finding a long-term solution for housing those living on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Long range, the University is building all kinds of stuff here … In all of that development I hope there is some provision for the poor among us,” Hedges said. “Some of the [homeless] folks that have died on the street here started out as students at UCSB … I’m not looking for anyone to come riding in with a bag full of money, but at least let’s be part of the plan together.”</p>\n<p>Anguiano also said the homeless community of I.V. is very different than that of cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco and students should take the time to hear their stories and share their own.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them come here because they want to hear what college students have to say or the things we’re thinking about,” Anguiano said. “Just talking with them … one-on-one getting to know them, like you’d get to know anyone. Just because they’re houseless doesn’t take away their humanity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Khan, who holds degrees from MIT and Harvard and is a former hedge fund analyst, created the Academy in 2005 as a tool to help tutor his cousins and expanded the idea into a web-based educational organization.</p>\n<p>Roman Baratiak, Associate Director of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, said in an email that Khan brings an optimistic message about the future of learning in relation to modern technology.</p>\n<p>“Arts &amp; Lectures invited Salman Khan because of his visionary work rethinking existing assumptions about education and his work connecting students to the digital age,” Baratiak said.</p>\n<p>Carina Salaiz, a second-year biology major, said Khan Academy videos often pertain to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education (S.T.E.M.) and were integral to her academic journey as a S.T.E.M. student.</p>\n<p>“I’ve used his videos so many times in the past for bio, calculus, chemistry,” Salaiz said. “They’re way more extensive and in-depth than other ‘how-to’ videos … you can find them on YouTube and they’re completely free.”</p>\n<p>Salaiz said Khan’s knowledge of technology helped make his program more accessible and understandable than any other educational organizations.</p>\n<p>“I feel like other nonprofit [organizations] need to step up their game and use more web outlets to reach out to more people,” Salaiz said. “It’s the easiest way and it’s cool how Khan utilizes that. I am definitely really inspired by his work.”</p>\n<p>Mao Chun Cheng, second-year political science major, said he appreciated Khan for using modern technology in a user-friendly way to assist students.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s a really honorable thing to want everybody to be educated,” Cheng said. “There’s no better way to reach out to kids struggling in school than YouTube videos and really nicely formatted websites.”</p>\n<p>Alyssa Sahu, second-year biology major, recounted the time when Khan visited her high school and said she appreciates how Khan opens up his program to students of all ages.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good speaker and he was really engaging,” Sahu said. “My friend’s little brother was actually featured on his website! I think Khan features smart kids once in a while to showcase kids that have used his program and have advanced in their own way.”</p>\n<p>Tickets for the lecture are available online or at the Arts &amp; Lectures ticket office on campus. Tickets are $16 for students and $28-$43 for the general public.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Photo</p></div>\n<p>California State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) recently introduced Senate Bill 900 (SB 900), known as the Coastal Oil Well Cleanup Act.</p>\n<p>SB 900 would require the California State Lands Commission to plug old oil wells in California waters “orphaned” by oil companies that go out of business and cease to be held responsible. The bill calls for an in-depth study of abandoned and unused oil wells concentrated along the Summerland and Ellwood beaches in Santa Barbara County.<br>\nJackson said the bill was inspired by a recent influx of oil onto Summerland Beach, leading to health warnings and beach closures over the past year.</p>\n<p>“This bill is a direct response to the issues we’ve been dealing with in Summerland in the oil fields there, [particularly] as a result of the Becker on-shore well which has been a problem in the Summerland area for decades,” Jackson said. “It was a well that was abandoned many years ago and was improperly capped.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, failure to properly cap the Becker on-shore well has been causing problems that affect the surrounding ocean and beaches.</p>\n<p>“This past year, it was leaking so measurably that it was creating all sorts of problems both in terms of odor it was emitting, and the crude oil that was finding its way onto the beaches and making it difficult for people to enjoy the beaches and the ocean,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would allow the state to learn more about other oil wells along the California coast and about the issue of natural seepage.</p>\n<p>“This legislation requires that we study these wells to find out which ones are leaking and what it will take to cap them,” Jackson said. “Also importantly, we will study the whole issue of natural seepage to determine if there is any or more than a relatively absorbable amount.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said SB 900 would ensure that State Lands Commission receive the funds and resources necessary to learn more about abandoned wells and cap-leaking wells.</p>\n<p>“If State Lands, which has the jurisdiction, fails to get the funding they need to cap this particular well, we will insure somewhere in the process, sooner rather than later frankly, we’ll be able to obtain the funds necessary in order to cap that well,” Jackson said. “It also gives State Lands the authority to do an analysis on the nearly 200 abandoned wells along the coast.”</p>\n<p>SB 900 is the beginning of a continuing effort to combat uncapped oil wells among the California coast, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“This [bill] is the beginning of the effort. If we achieve a regular funding mechanism, we hope we can address at least $2 million worth of the problem and perhaps more as we know exactly the full extent of the problem,” Jackson said. “The full time frame is yet unknown because we don’t know the full extent of the problem.”<br>\nJackson said she hopes to move the bill through the process and to the governor’s desk by the end of the 2016 State Senate session, in September.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

academy aimed at providing free, world-class education around the globe.</p>\n<p>Khan, who holds degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University and authored the acclaimed novel <em>The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined </em>(2012), transformed his over-the-phone tutoring skills into a YouTube channel and website called Khan Academy. Currently, the Khan Academy has a library of over 7,000 tutoring videos and receives up to 14 million visitors each month.</p>\n<p>Khan said he spent many afternoons tutoring his cousins and while tutoring his 12-year-old cousin Nadia he had several of what he called ‘aha moments’ that made him realize the impact he could have through education.</p>\n<p>Khan said he is proud to empower students to succeed in disciplines for which they have been told they do not have the “gene.”</p>\n<p>“There’s something very powerful here,” Khan said. “We now can tell the student, ‘Keep working on it. You haven’t mastered it yet,’ because the tools are there now.”</p>\n<p>Khan also said there is “a lot to be done” in terms of education, but he hopes to make his tools available to “level the playing field” for students who don’t have access to other resources.</p>\n<p>“The deck isn’t stacked against them as much as they think,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Hamza Bhatti said Khan’s videos helped him throughout high school in classes like calculus, physics and biology and his younger brother now uses the Academy.</p>\n<p>“It was really cool to hear his voice in person instead of a blackboard,” Bhatti said. “My little brother is in eighth grade right now, so he’s going to be involved with Khan Academy, and that’s why I wanted to come.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67608\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67608\" data-attachment-id=\"67608\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/salman-khan_by-alex-payne-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Salman Khan (Khan Academy)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67608\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3-682x1024.jpg?resize=332%2C499\" alt=\"Alex Payne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"332\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Bhatti said he appreciated Khan’s description of his college experience, in which Khan recounted social and academic challenges.</p>\n<p>“For [Khan] to say that he submitted 40 [job] applications and didn’t get any of them, but then the 41st paid off, it was like the light of day, and something that I want to pass on to my little brother,” Bhatti said.</p>\n<p>Wan Pei Fung, second-year biology major and exchange student from Singapore, said she attended the event because she uses Khan’s videos both at UCSB and in Singapore.</p>\n<p>“I really used a lot of [Khan’s] videos for chemistry and physics so I wanted to come and learn more about Khan Academy,” Fung said.</p>\n<p>Fung said Khan’s statement that “anything worth doing is something you can fail at” encouraged her to take on challenges.</p>\n<p>“For me, I don’t want to do something because I know I’m not good at it, like physics and computer science,” Fung said. “But after that, I realized that I have to try, and that failing might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Sydni Baker said that her favorite part of Khan’s lecture was his message to students to participate in activities they enjoy.</p>\n<p>“I feel, like, validated. Things that I have done to [make] me happy, like joining a club or making a business with my mom, may be a sacrifice of time, but benefit me overall,” Baker said.</p>\n<p>Third-year classics major Chelsea Brandwein said she attended the speaking event to learn about Kahn’s take on education.</p>\n<p>“I’m expecting to learn something I didn’t know before and emerge with a different perspective about learning, the pursuit of knowledge and what it means to be a student,” Brandwein said.</p>\n<p>Khan said he hopes to continue to reach more students in hopes of giving them “agency over their learning” and “agency over their life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/","id":3869,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[3868,3867,3866],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
