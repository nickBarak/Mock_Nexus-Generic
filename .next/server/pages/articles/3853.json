Last year, the event raised more than $30,000 for the cause. Everyone is invited to take the plunge in costume or simply make a donation. A minimum donation of $50 is asked of participants taking the plunge, with a free T-shirt and breakfast courtesy of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department included.</p>\n<p>Gina Carbajal, regional director for the Special Olympics of SB, said the fundraiser provided crucial funding for the organization.</p>\n<p>“The polar plunge, and this is our second annual one here in Santa Barbara, is really a way for individuals and groups to actually come together and raise money for Special Olympics,” Carbajal said. “All the money that we raise stays here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>According to Carbajal, the event is very flexible and casual.</p>\n<p>“Individuals get the time to just go and plunge in the water here at Leadbetter Beach, either individually or as groups,” Carbajal said. “You just come out in your shorts, bathing suit — some people come out in costumes.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said there are a different shirts for those who swim and for those who are “too chicken.”</p>\n<p>“The pledgers get a shirt. It’s a full-on shirt that actually has the Polar Plunge and Special Olympics logo on it,” Carbajal said. “It says ‘I took the plunge’ and individuals that don’t want to plunge — are too chicken to plunge — get a shirt that says ‘I was too chicken to plunge.’”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said people should donate because the money raised will stay local, going directly to the Special Olympics chapter for Santa Barbara youth.</p>\n<p>“The moneys that are raised are used for individuals with intellectual disabilities, so individuals that have, for example, Down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy and other types of intellectual disabilities,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Another sponsor of the event is the Hutton Parker Foundation, which funds nonprofit organizations in Santa Barbara County. Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lewis said the foundation has been a long-time supporter of Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>“Benefiting Special Olympics is a very unique and fulfilling event that gives a lot of visibility to the organization and that just helps them to further promote themselves and their programs,” Lewis said. “It’s for a great cause.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/","id":3853,"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias"},"related":[3852,3851,3850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias","biography":"Not available","articles":[2539,2549,2581,2612,2635,3853,4577,4637],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., April 17, 11:11 p.m. -- Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive couldn't help but pay attention when an intoxicated male started running back and forth down the middle of street, d...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Pledging My Time</p>\n<p>Fri., April 17, 11:11 p.m. — Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but pay attention when an intoxicated male started running back and forth down the middle of street, doing summersaults and shouting incoherently.</p>\n<p>So jubilant was the 22-year-old that he somersaulted right into an officer. The deputy, who was unharmed by the drunken gymnast, asked the young man what he was doing.</p>\n<p>Realizing he was speaking to a figure of authority, the inebriated man stood tall, his back rigid, and shouted, “Pledging my sorority, sir!”</p>\n<p>The gender-confused man didn’t have any identification on him and refused, or was simply unable, to give any personal information to the officers and instead continued to yell about his pledging efforts. Then realizing he was about to be arrested, the self-described Marine dropped to the ground, put his face to the asphalt and put his hands behind his back, shouting, “This is what I do when I get arrested, sir!”</p>\n<p>Not wishing to appear rude, the deputies arrested the hopeful pledge and started toward the patrol car. The drunken serviceman was not done being arrested, though, and dropped to the ground face-down several more times before the officers could get him in the car.</p>\n<p>Once seated, the young man lost his cool and started slamming his head against the Plexiglas divider. A few drunken hissy fits later, the deputy was forced to spray mace into his eyes.</p>\n<p> Eventually the alcohol-laden 22-year-old was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Getting Trashed</p>\n<p>Sun., April 19, 1:25 a.m. — Officers responding to reports of an unresponsive male lying on the ground behind 6571 Del Playa Drive found a heavily intoxicated man struggling to stay upright.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the 18-year-old as he was loitering about the large dumpsters behind the ocean-side apartment complex. The young UCSB student was clearly inebriated, as evidenced by the copious amounts of urine and vomit staining his jeans.</p>\n<p>The officers attempted to start a conversation with the man while they waited for paramedics to arrive, but his ability to speak had apparently been drowned in alcohol. He may, however, have just been preoccupied with something else, given that he had both hands stuffed down his heavily soiled pants. No matter the question, the self-fondling dumpster diver just stood there shivering, no doubt chilled by his moist trousers.</p>\n<p>Some time later, the paramedics arrived but eventually released the dubious drunkard back into police custody, who arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was given fresh clothing and housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Double the Drunk</p>\n<p>Sat., April 18, 1:32 a.m. — Deputies on patrol were called to 6681 Del Playa Drive to deal with a reported disturbance.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the officers witnessed a pair of twin brothers leaving an upstairs party. The two, both well beyond drunk, stumbled towards the staircase: their first obstacle.</p>\n<p>The first brother clutched the handrail tightly, eventually making it down the stairs without incident. His partner in crime, however, went full-bore down the stairs, nearly tumbling several times. It was not until he reached flat ground, however, that gravity won the battle and he fell to the pavement.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the first twin put one foot in front of the other until he reached the second main obstacle: a wooden gate. Having traveled the 30 feet to the gate, the brother could go no farther, fell to the ground and was unable to get back up.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, twin number two recovered from his tumble and made his way to the gate. His attempts to open it, however, were foiled by the fact he reached for the hinge instead of the latch.</p>\n<p>After about a minute of watching the two try to open the gate, the deputies felt obliged and opened it for them. With no other obstacles standing in their way, the 20-year-old twins were arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where they were housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/","id":3850,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3849,3848,3847],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat., May 2, 11:17 p.m. - The bumping rhythms emanating from the balcony of the Marley House - 6566 Del Playa Dr. - piqued the interest of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When Stupidity Wins Out<br>\nSat., May 2, 11:17 p.m. – The bumping rhythms emanating from the balcony of the Marley House – 6566 Del Playa Dr. – piqued the interest of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>With a raucous group ahead, the officers made their way through the crowd and to the stairwell where they found their first victim: a minor with an open beer.</p>\n<p>But the real prize was just starting to make his way down the stairs. With a bottle of Andre’s sparkling wine in one hand and a cigar in the other, the sunglass-clad 18-year-old was too cool for his own good. The officers stopped the hipster and asked his age. After briefly hesitating, he told the officers he was 21.</p>\n<p>The deputies weren’t fooled, however, and asked to see his ID. The champagne sipper reached for his wallet, paused and then decided it was better to just run. Wine still in hand, he pushed past the officers and sprinted onto DP.</p>\n<p>The officers immediately gave chase, and even tried to taser the sprinting bro, though unsuccessfully. The deputies did manage to spot him zipping into a backyard on Sabado Tarde, and after some cunning police work, officers apprehended the inebriated young man.</p>\n<p>The deputies then escorted him to their patrol car and drove him toward the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, the defeated SBCC student spontaneously told the officers that he only ran because he thought he was going to be arrested. Officers promptly informed him that he would have only received a citation.</p>\n<p>“So you mean I would have just gotten a ticket?” asked the dismayed reveler just before being booked into the jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Don’t Forget to Flush<br>\nSun., May 3, 2:56 a.m. – Employees working the Saturday night shift at Silvergreens Restaurant were all set to go home when they found a surprise in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>There, slouched over the toilet, lay a young woman sound asleep. Attempts to rouse her proved ineffective and the tired-eyed employees instead sought the help of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived some minutes later and were led into the bathroom. There the officers found the 20-year-old sleeping blissfully upon the white ceramic seat, her hair mussed and her pants still around her ankles. She had, it appeared, fallen asleep in the act of peeing.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the UCSB student, however, that it took the officers several minutes to wake her from her drunken stupor. Only after lifting her head and vigorously shaking her arm did she even respond.</p>\n<p>Having finally succeeded in rousing her, the deputies attempted to retrieve some basic information. The sloppy sleeper, however, was unable to form coherent words and instead took to spitting repeatedly on the floor.</p>\n<p>With that, the officers arrested the drunken squatter. She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Hurricane<br>\nMon., May 11, 12:42 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to 6690 Abrego Rd. on reports that a heavily tattooed man was wreaking havoc at the apartment complex.</p>\n<p>A result copious amounts of alcohol and too much testosterone, the inebriated man was a walking disaster. According to the reporting party, the 23-year-old had been breaking glass bottles and smashing bikes, apparently just for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>When the deputies arrived, they found the San Jose native with his pants down urinating on the door to an apartment. The pugnacious pisser was cognizant enough to notice the officers, however, and quickly sucked up the pain and turned off the nozzle.</p>\n<p>Having easily found their suspect, the deputies took a moment to check their surroundings. It was as if a tornado had ripped through the apartment complex, with broken glass strewn in every corner and several bikes submerged in the pool.</p>\n<p>Despite being the only person in the vicinity, the self-professed musician adamantly denied having caused any of the destruction. The officers weren’t fazed and arrested the man anyway.</p>\n<p>He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/","id":3851,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3850,3849,3848],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Best of Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Wed., Oct. 15, 3:48 p.m. - Deputies enjoying a sunny Wednesday afternoon were called to duty when they witnessed a young lady struggling to walk near the intersection of Embarcadero del Norte and Pica...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Soggy Bottomed Girl<br>\nWed., Oct. 15, 3:48 p.m. – Deputies enjoying a sunny Wednesday afternoon were called to duty when they witnessed a young lady struggling to walk near the intersection of Embarcadero del Norte and Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>The officers watched the stumbling stroller for approximately one block, during which she weaved back and forth, stumbled into innocent passersby and fell into a bush. She had another female with her, but she was not assisting the inebriated.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the 19-year-old woman, and immediately picked up on the strong odor of alcohol coming from her person.</p>\n<p>They asked the young woman where she was coming from and she replied that she had just left her sorority. She was then asked where she was heading, and she replied her sorority.</p>\n<p>When asked how much she had had to drink, she said, “Enough.” After speaking with her friend, the officers learned that they had come from the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity house, where the various sororities had been competing in a “gladiator style” sporting event.</p>\n<p>She was arrested and transported to the Isla Vista sub-station on Trigo Road. There she was placed on a chair in the holding cell, but after a half-hour of repeatedly falling off she was moved to the floor.</p>\n<p>Her intoxication seemed to be increasing, and at times she lost consciousness. Then, she began to urinate, soaking her shorts and the ground that she was sitting on. She made no attempt to move and ultimately passed out in a puddle of her own urine.</p>\n<p>The sorority girl was then transported to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for alcohol overdose, but was ultimately released back to the sheriff’s department and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You’re No Jim Morrison<br>\nFri., April 25, 12:56 a.m. – Informed by numerous people of a man lying in the grass at Sea Outlook Park, located on the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive, a bicycle patrol officer made his way to the area.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the park, he saw a man lying on his side, seemingly unconscious, with both his pants and underwear pulled down to mid-thigh. Despite his apparent efforts to stay dry, his trousers were soaked and the man stunk of urine.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the 23-year old was positioned in such that the view from the street was one featuring his naked ass. Also, the man’s left shoe was removed and sitting near his head.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing for the inebriated man’s health, called paramedics and attempted to rouse the urine-soaked, half-naked, mostly unconscious partier.</p>\n<p>Succeeding in having the man open his eyes, the deputy asked the pungent-smelling sleeper for some basic information, such as his name and age. This man, however, had simply consumed too much to partake in simple conversation.</p>\n<p>In response to the officer’s questions, the man rambled off a series of no’s and then jammed out on his imaginary air guitar.</p>\n<p>After paramedics determined the man was not in need of immediate medical attention, he was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>A Beautiful Mind<br>\nThursday, Jan. 31, 2:12 a.m. – Officers stationed at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office were informed of a drunken woman who was unable to pay the bill for a cab ride.</p>\n<p>The woman, who was dropped off on Pardall Road, was returning from a night out at a Goleta bar.</p>\n<p>The ride-stealing suspect had had a bit too much to drink however, and appeared to have some loose change after all.</p>\n<p>Clearly alone, the woman was convinced there was another person inside the cab when she had entered.</p>\n<p>Putting the issue of the disappearing passenger aside, the officer asked the woman how she had planned to pay for the taxi.</p>\n<p>She calmly told the deputy that she was going to pay the fare of $16.75 using her cell phone. The suspect tried to complete the transaction several times, but despite her sincerest efforts, her mobile would not issue legal tender.</p>\n<p>With her phone apparently void of its magic-giving abilities, the woman lost her composure and resorted to screaming and yelling.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19170\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19170\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/best-of-police-blotter/","id":3852,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3851,3850,3849],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
