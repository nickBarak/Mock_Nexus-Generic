On the other hand, UCSB comes off a tough 65-56 loss to rival Cal Poly in which UCSB was unable to stop Cal Poly’s offense. The Mustangs shot an incredible 45.3 percent from the field, including 47.1 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“You have to be upset about the last game and have some fire from that game, but you also have to forget about it,” Zornig said. “You just have to go out there and play your game and hopefully, we’ll get the ‘W’.”</p>\n<p>When its opponent breaks the 60 point mark, Santa Barbara is just 1-8.</p>\n<p>Therefore, after an off game defensively versus Cal Poly, the Gauchos have certainly focused in on defense this week. Typically, defense is the team’s bread and butter as they lead the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 54.0 points per game.</p>\n<p>Defensively, UCSB will key in on number five, junior forward Kamilah Martin. Martin averages a double-double, ranking third in the Big West in scoring and second in rebounding with 15.3 and 10.0 per game, respectively. She also shoots 50.6 percent from the field, good enough for third place in league.</p>\n<p>“[Martin is] a very talented and a physical post player, who has a variety of moves on the block, so a key for us is obviously stopping her,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We have a lot of different ways we’re going to guard her and we have to stick to our defensive principles.”</p>\n<p>Playing the same position for the Gauchos, Underwood averages 11.8 points per game, tenth in the conference, and nine rounds per game, good enough for fourth in the Big West. Shooting 49.3 percent from the field, she also ranks fifth in field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>The last time these teams met up in Hawaii, the Gauchos came away with a 51-50 win that handed the Rainbow Wahine their first home conference loss. UCSB was clutch down the stretch with junior guard Nicole Nesbit making a lay-up with 12.5 seconds remaining to give Santa Barbara a one-point lead. On the other end, the Gauchos came up with the defensive stop and earned its first come from behind victory of the season.</p>\n<p>“That game we willed ourselves to a win,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We made big stops and we had players that stepped up and were willing to take the big shots.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff against Hawaii is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 21st 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier/ Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/gauchos-prep-to-host-first-place-hawaii/","id":639,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[638,637,636],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Lucky Number 13","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Womens-Basketball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Womens-Basketball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The last time the UCSB and Hawaii women’s basketball teams played in Hawaii, the game went down to the final buzzer.

I always expect to win. It was a game we could’ve won.”</p>\n<p>After holding Hawaii’s star, junior forward Kamilah Martin, to two points and four rebounds in the first half, Martin took control of the game in the second half. With approximately 16 minutes remaining, Martin went on a 6-0 run.</p>\n<p>“[Martin’s] a great player,” Mitchell said. “Six of her 14 points came from the free throw line, so we’ll have to do a better job on getting onto her pivot foot and not bailing her out with a foul as the shot clock’s running down.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii fed off of Martin’s energy, seizing the momentum and expanding the lead to seven on a 12-2 run.</p>\n<p>“I think it had a lot to do with those first four minutes of the second half,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We were extremely flat and I think that’s when you saw a momentum change. I think that we let them get physical with us and it took a while for us to fight back.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB responded with a 9-2 run to tie the game at 45 all.</p>\n<p>“We just started attacking them,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We just have to learn to go at them and start from the beginning.”</p>\n<p>With 54 seconds to go, Underwood converted a layup to bring the score to 53-51. The next trip up the court, senior center Kirsten Tilleman forced Martin to turn the ball over and senior guard Destini Mason picked up the steal, giving UCSB possession of the ball with 27 seconds left.</p>\n<p>Similar to the play in Hawaii that won the game for the Gauchos, Nesbit dribbled down the right side of the court. As she drove into the key though, she was tied up and the possession arrow gave the ball back to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I was just attacking,” Nesbit said. “Our mentality was to get to the basket and get fouled. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the foul and they got the possession.”</p>\n<p>On the inbounds, UCSB was forced to foul and freshman guard Destiny King headed to the free throw line with a chance to finish the game. However, she only made one of her two free throws, giving UCSB hope and the ball at just a one-possession game.</p>\n<p>UCSB called a timeout, the score 54-51 with 4.6 seconds remaining in the game. On the inbounds play, Santa Barbara’s best three-point shooter, junior guard Melissa Zornig, came off a screen and received the ball at the top of the key. Driving to her left, she fired up a three point shot, but unfortunately for the Gauchos, the shot missed off the side of the rim.</p>\n<p>“It was the play we wanted; it wasn’t the shot we necessarily wanted because otherwise it would’ve gone in,” Mitchell said. “At the end of day, it shouldn’t have come down to that.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB outshot Hawaii 47.2 percent to 41.9 percent, but the Rainbow Wahine held the rebounding advantage at 27-23. The Gauchos gave up nine offensive boards, including several down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“The ultimate difference was I think the offensive rebounds in critical times when the shot clock was going down,” Mitchell said. “When [you] play hard for 28 seconds, give up the offensive board and you send them to the free throw line, I think that probably deflates you as a player at times.”</p>\n<p>Underwood led the charge offensively with 16 points while Nesbit chipped in 15. For Hawaii, Martin finished the game with 14 points and eight rebounds, but it was the bench that made the ultimate difference for Hawaii. 26 of the Rainbow Wahine’s 54 points came from the bench as junior guard Shawna-Lei Kuehu and King combined for 23 points.</p>\n<p>“We know they have strong, physical guards,” Mitchell said. “Kuehu and King are both wide bodies. [Hawaii] posted [their] guards and unfortunately, you can’t double when you have guards that are going to knock it down.”</p>\n<p>Despite a tough loss, UCSB will need to regroup quickly as the team hosts Cal State Northridge Saturday. The Gauchos have won the last 12 matchups against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>At 13-13 overall and 7-7 in the Big West, Northridge, like Santa Barbara, is a great defensive team, ranking second in scoring defense at 59.8 points per game and first in steals at 11.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“Losing can drive you out of your mind, but last time I checked, we have five more games left and we can control our own destiny,” Mitchell said. “There’s still a lot of season left to be played and the season’s not over with a loss here tonight.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met up in Northridge, UCSB defeated the Matadors handily 56-37. The Gauchos shot 46.8 percent from the field, including 57.7 percent in the second half. Then, they held the Matadors defensively to just 24.5 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>“They’re an extremely athletic team,” Mitchell said. “They’ll have their best game after we handled them well at their place.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Mark Brocher/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50297\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50297\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/lucky-number-13-2/","id":636,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[635,634,633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joe Pasternack and the Gauchos Storm Into the T-Dome for Exhibition Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Gabe-vincent-cutout.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Gabe-vincent-cutout.png?resize=683%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Head Coach Joe Pasternack and the UCSB men's basketball team are set to make their debut with an exhibition game this Saturday.

Jackson was a three-year starter at Rice, while King II played in 20 games for Nevada last season after transferring from Brown University.</p>\n<p>Last season, Jackson was the third leading scorer on the team with 12.2 points per game, while his 2.3 assists ranked second best on the team. The Acton, Calif., native had season-ending knee surgery during what would have been his junior season in 2015-16, one year after averaging a career-high 14.5 points per game and leading the conference in three-point makes with 85 of them.</p>\n<p>King II averaged 3.7 points and 2.6 rebounds per game with the Wolf Pack and 12.1 ppg and 6.5 boards per match in two seasons at Brown. King II graduated from Nevada last year with a degree in business.</p>\n<p>Both players are expected to start and contribute right away to a Gaucho team that struggled in all facets of the game last season. Joining them will be a plethora of returners, including seniors Gabe Vincent, Alex Hart and Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the former, Vincent is coming off an ACL tear that ended his season back in February. Before that, the shooting guard was one of the few bright spots UCSB could count on as, before missing the final eight games of the season, he was averaging 14.8 points per game along with 3.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per match.</p>\n<p>Despite the injury, the Stockton, Calif. native is still a well-respected figure in the Big West basketball community, as he was the only Gaucho named to the Big West All-Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>Due to his barely getting back into game action for the first time in a while, expect Vincent to have his minutes limited Saturday, as well as maybe the first few games of the season, before making a return to the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>For Canty, this is his second year as a Gaucho after transferring from community college. Like Vincent, Canty was getting better with each game throughout the season, at one point leading the Big West in rebounds, but was sidelined for all of conference play due to academic ineligibility.</p>\n<p>In 10 games last year, the big power forward averaged 10.2 points per game along with 7.0 boards. This summer, Canty has worked incredibly hard in both the classroom and the weight room, as he is eligible to play, and he has slimmed down considerably in hopes that it can help diversify his game.</p>\n<p>The last senior on the team, Hart, was one of the main threats for the Gauchos when Canty was ruled ineligible to play. Last year, Hart, who plays center, played in all 28 games for UCSB, averaging 7.6 points per contest. He was able to really improve in his final eight games of the year, scoring in double figures four times, including a season-high 16 points twice.</p>\n<p>Other notable players to watch out for will be sophomore guard Clifton Powell Jr., who was a sparkplug off the bench for the ‘Chos last season, sophomore guard Max Heidegger, who had an average slash line of 7.6/2.1/1.4, and junior forward J.D. Slajchert, who brings tremendous energy every time he is out on the court.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the court, Fresno Pacific will also be looking to improve off of an average season that saw them go 7-20 on the year but 7-13 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Sunbirds were tapped to finish 11th in the PacWest Conference and had no players named to the preseason all-conference team.</p>\n<p>Under second-year Head Coach C.J. Haydock, FPU will look to rely on senior center Oliver Herting, who only averaged 6.5 ppg and 1.6 rebounds but is one of the few remaining members, as the team has added nine newcomers to the squad this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match won’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of the score, as they are expected to bull over their opponent, but what will be important is how they look doing it. With many new pieces in Santa Barbara, it will be interesting to see how Pasternack could make it all work.</p>\n<p>The team has been predicted to finish sixth in the conference this season. However, if some of these additions can work, maybe this team’s ceiling is higher.</p>\n<p>First impressions are everything, and Pasternack has stated he wants the Thunderdome to be packed this season. Winning is one of the first steps he can take to ensure it is.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on FPU in an exhibition match at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 4, at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 2, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

For Taran Brown, a native of Wyoming, the transition from small-town boy to college basketball player has shown he has the potential to be a star in the making.</p>\n<p>As a redshirt freshman, Brown has embraced the transition from the small-town vibe of Wyoming to the California living of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It was a huge transition for me; it’s a night-and-day difference,” Brown said. “The ocean and the people and the things to do — I definitely like it out here a lot more ­— the opportunities you have out here and the connections and stuff. I enjoy myself out here a lot more, I would say.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brown hails from Gillette, Wyoming, the fourth-largest city in the state with a population of roughly 30,000. Needless to say, growing up in such a small and isolated place certainly helped to shape Brown into the man and player he is today.</p>\n<p>“Everyone kind of knows everyone and that’s kind of how it is in Wyoming,” Brown said. “If you’re a pretty well-known athlete, you kind of just know everyone because it is a small place. There’s not a lot of violence there, so it’s a great place to grow up. I really love Wyoming, especially my hometown.”</p>\n<p>Making it as a basketball player was not always the only dream for Brown. He played football and participated in several track events including hurdles, high jump, long jump and the triple jump up until his sophomore year in high school. Had he continued playing either sport, Brown has no doubt he could have played either at the college level.</p>\n<p>“I quit just to focus on basketball,” Brown said. “I was actually pretty good in both of those and went to state in both of those. It would have been fun to be a college wide receiver, but I think my passion is definitely basketball.”</p>\n<p>While his 6’8” frame would have certainly proven deadly as a wide receiver, where Brown truly excels is in his athletic ability. His ability to shoot and run the floor like a guard with the build of a forward helped him to establish a future beyond playing high school ball at Campbell County High School.</p>\n<p>“It was tough, especially since the population is not too high in Wyoming. There is under a million people, so it’s hard to get recognized for basketball,” Brown said. “We didn’t have [Amateur Athletic Union], so my traveling coaches when I grew up, we all went to tournaments all over just to get my name out there.”</p>\n<p>During high school, Brown stood out on a national stage despite playing in the least populated state in the country. Taran was named a McDonald’s All-American as well as the Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Wyoming. He was also a two-time All-State selection and led Campbell County to a state title during his senior year.</p>\n<p>“[Assistant] Coach [Matt] Stock (a Wyoming native) really deserves credit on [bringing Taran to UCSB] because of the Wyoming connection,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He had heard a ton about him and been in touch with him and had been mailing him stuff. I watched him play in Vegas, and from that, that’s when we really started recruiting him. Once he got out here and saw Santa Barbara and all that compared to where he grew up, it was a really nice opportunity for him.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the charm of Santa Barbara lured Brown, a sociology major, away from competing schools such as Colorado State and Wyoming. Last season, Brown, along with Coach Williams, decided to redshirt in order to save a year of eligibility. That decision allowed him to focus on transitioning from Wyoming life to the faster California lifestyle he wasn’t used to.</p>\n<p>“To see his transition was funny. When he first got here he didn’t know a lot of things, didn’t know a lot of California terms, didn’t know a lot of places to go eat and never heard of a lot of things,” sophomore guard T.J. Taylor said. “It was very fun to see him transition from a little Wyoming kid to now, almost a superstar.”</p>\n<p>This season, Brown has shown just how dangerous of a player he can be. With six games left in the regular season, he has already broken the school’s single-season record for three-pointers made in a season by a freshman with 52. That number ranks seventh in the entire Big West Conference. His 11.7 points per game rank third this season for UCSB and are first amongst freshmen in the conference.</p>\n<p>Brown has also shown to be versatile aside from scoring, ranking second on the team in rebounds (5.7), steals (0.9) and blocks (1.0), third in assists (2.2) and first in minutes per game (31.1). He has eclipsed the 20-point mark three times this season and registered a career-high 22 points in only his second game as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“His potential is to the sky, it’s just on him to have the mentality to come into the gym everyday, really working to get better and really believing in himself as well,” Taylor said. “I think he will, with the push from the coaches and his teammates. He can be a superstar. I’m excited to see him grow and become a better player.”</p>\n<p>With his future looking bright at UCSB, Brown’s dreams of playing basketball as a profession are slowly taking shape. Who would have thought that a small-town kid from snowy northeastern Wyoming would one day become the big man on campus at sunny Santa Barbara?</p>\n<p>“Ever since I was five years old, I just started with a ball and had travel leagues from first grade all the way until now. It’s always been my thing and I just really love to play,” Brown said. “When I’m on the court, it just feels like I’m in the right place. I’m going to bring basketball as far as I can. I know I have a ways to go, but anything can happen, so I’m going to keep pushing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays at UC Riverside tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of February 20th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/","id":638,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[637,636,635],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
