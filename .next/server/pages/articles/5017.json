The two teams had already met four times prior to Sunday’s match with UCSB being the victors in all four games. After two disappointing performances to open the tournament, it was clear Santa Barbara was determined to establish their offensive attack early.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the first frame, sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild scored with a medium range shot followed by a beautiful corner shot from freshman driver Boris Jovanovic, putting the Gauchos up 2-0.</p>\n<p>It was a highly contested defensive match in the second quarter with both teams not scoring until Hauschild added his second goal with just over two minutes to give UCSB a 3-0 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>The 49ers managed to respond in the second half, scoring the first two goals to open the third to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to one goal.</p>\n<p>Jovanovic stopped the run, netting his second goal of the contest while Hauschild completed a hat trick just before the end of the third to make the score 5-3 in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The final frame started with a score from junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton and LBSU countering back the very next possession. Senior attacker Derek Shoemaker added a goal to make the score 7-4 with just over four minutes left.</p>\n<p>Although the game seemed like it was going to be easily won by UCSB, the 49ers did not go away easily, adding two goals to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 7-6 with just over one minute left. In its final possession, LBSU missed the shot and the clock ran out giving the Gauchos the victory and the seventh-place finish.</p>\n<p>Before ending on a high note, Santa Barbara lost to a team ranked lower than itself for the first time this season after a poor performance against UCI. It had beaten the Anteaters earlier in the season thanks to a game-winning shot. However, UCI was able to avoid the intense ending in Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ star senior driver Lovre Milos started the scoring by making a goal three seconds into the start of the match. UCSB responded by scoring two goals courtesy of Shoemaker but gave up two scores to the Anteaters as they took the 3-2 lead after the first.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker and Hamilton added two goals for UCSB in the second quarter to give it a 4-3 halftime lead. However, in the second half the team fell apart, surrendering five-straight goals.</p>\n<p>Within a span of thirty seconds into the third quarter, the Anteaters scored three goals to go up 6-4. They would add one more in the fourth to win the game 7-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ four goals tied a season-low. It would be in back-to-back matches they tied their season-low, having happened first in their quarterfinal matchup against Cal.</p>\n<p>The Bears scored two goals in the first quarter to take an early lead. UCSB’s lone goal in the first half came late in the second period thanks to Shoemaker. After his score, the Gauchos surrendered three-straight goals, going down 6-1 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Cal added two more goals to start the third and took a commanding 8-1 lead. With the quarter nearing the end, Shoemaker added one more goal to make the score 8-2 after three quarters.</p>\n<p>Shoemaker completed a hat trick in the fourth period, scoring his third score of the game. Hauschild also added a goal but the outcome was inevitable. The Gauchos lost 11-4, diminishing their hopes of winning their first MPSF championship in school history.</p>\n<p>Still, the two seniors that led Santa Barbara throughout the season put on good performances to end their careers as Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge tallied 40 saves on the weekend, ending his career with 895 saves, the second most in MPSF history. Shoemaker had six goals in the three games and finished the season as the Gauchos leading scorer with 48.</p>\n<p>Although the final weekend did not go the way UCSB intended it to go, it still had a solid season overall. The 16-11 finish was an improvement from the year before and overall, the team looked competitive in almost every match.</p>\n<p>The losses of the four seniors will have an impact, but the Gauchos still have plenty of young talent such as Hauschild, Jovanovic and Hamilton returning. The exposure that these young players gained from playing this season along with the growth of the rest of the team makes UCSB a considerable contender to emerge for a top finish in next year’s MPSF standings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

It was junior defender Sophie Trabucco who opened up the scoreboard at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243779\">7:00</span> mark. However, the Hawks quickly responded with three consecutive goals from Katie McKenty, LJ Edwards, and Lauren Brennan.</p>\n<p>Hartwick once again came out strong in the second quarter and went on another 3-1 run putting them in the lead 6-3 with three minutes left in the half. UCSB executed on consecutive possessions shortening the Hawks lead, but the Hawks found the back of the cage in the last second to take them into half time with a two score lead.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was a constant battle for the Gauchos who tied the score in two occasions, only to have Hartwick reclaim their lead shortly after. With little time left on the clock, Santa Barbara turned to senior center Lauren Martin who scored 21 seconds after the Hawks had gained a two-goal lead, and was followed by junior attacker Brenna Thomas on a power play to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s senior attacker Bryn Hudson scored first in overtime, Brittany Tait would give the Hawks another chance by forcing the game into sudden death. This was the first time Santa Barbara had gone into sudden death so far in the season.</p>\n<p>It was Martin who won the sprint to give UCSB the first possession, in which she capitalized with the winning goal after 21 seconds to finish 15-14.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day proved to be just as challenging for the Gauchos who came out on top after another overtime game against Pacific.</p>\n<p>Carrying on the momentum from the first match, Martin scored back-to-back goals to start the game. The Tigers found the back of the net on three occasions to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore reclaimed the lead at the start of the second period, scoring on her own rebound after her shot had gone off the post the first time.</p>\n<p>The Tigers had a comeback in the second quarter. For the first time in the game they took the lead after a penalty shot taken by Rachel Krieger. Pacific was now on top with a two-goal lead by the halftime break.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly came back and tied the game within the first minute of the third period with the help of Thomas who set up senior utility Samantha Murphy and Martin on back-to-back possessions.</p>\n<p>The seesaw battle carried on to the last period, in what looked like the Tigers would pull off the win after scoring with only 38 seconds left. But the Gauchos drew an ejection foul and took advantage on their last possession, with Shore scoring the equalizer with 13 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored first in overtime with Shore assisting Martin, followed by freshman defender Kristen Denney to end the first OT period. The tigers tried to fight back, but their goal from Ellen Tiedmann was retaliated by junior utility Miranda Schrader securing the win for the Gauchos, 13-11.</p>\n<p>Martin finished the day with a total of seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against Pacific making it the second game in the season in which she collects that many. Contributing to the day’s success were Hudson, Schrader, and Thomas with four goals of their own.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos split the final day of the invitational falling to No. 7 Michigan, the top ranked team in the tournament, in a 14-8 loss and another nail biter win over No. 15 San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines scored the first goal of the game, but were answered by Thomas to put UCSB on the board. Although the Gauchos scored once again, they also allowed two goals sending them into the second quarter behind Michigan 4-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored on three occasions in the second quarter, two of them coming from Murphy, but Michigan put away four unanswered goals to stay on top.</p>\n<p>The 11-5 lead by the Wolverines proved to be too much for the Gauchos despite two goals by sophomore utility Camila Schafer and Kreiser. Michigan sealed the deal with three more goals to end the game with a six-point deficit.</p>\n<p>The final game of the weekend resulted in a 9-8 victory over SDSU.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs got on the board first, but their lead only lasted 12 seconds thanks to a hat trick delivered by Murphy. The Gauchos would then go on a 3-0 run, including two from Murphy. San Diego put away three of its own, but were unable to take the lead ending the first period trailing UCSB 4-3.</p>\n<p>Although the second half of the game fluctuated between a one or two point difference, the Gauchos never let SDSU tie it up.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara went into the final quarter up 8-6, but the Aztecs found the back of the net at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243780\">6:11</span> mark putting them within one point.</p>\n<p>Thomas scored the last goal for the Gauchos, and although Tayla Walsh responded to it, it was not enough to come out on top.</p>\n<p>Defense took care of the remainder of the game not allowing any more goals from the Aztecs and senior goalkeeper MacKenzie Broakaw recording a late-game save.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will resume play on February 13<sup>th</sup> at the Triton Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos knew they would have to play well throughout the game if they wanted to beat their opponents the third time around.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We had lost pretty badly to them twice before and felt we didn’t stick to our game plan,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We knew if we play a better game we could hang with them and get the win at home.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did come out strong, scoring on its first possession thanks to a goal by sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild. Later in the first period freshman driver Borislav Jovanovic scored an amazing no-look goal during a power play opportunity, making the score 3-1 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>It was an historic moment during the second period as senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge became just the 13th goalie in MPSF history to have over 700 career saves. His 700th save came on a power play opportunity that Cal failed to capitalize on.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool obviously and an honor,” Whitelegge said. “But it’s still team goals over individual goals for me.”</p>\n<p>Following that, the Gauchos found themselves up 5-2 in the second thanks to a penalty goal by Hauschild. However, momentum shifted quickly once Cal junior defender Farrel South converted on a penalty, reducing the Gauchos’ lead to 5-3.</p>\n<p>The Golden Bear defender sparked his team’s takeover of UCSB’s lead, scoring Cal’s next four goals to hand his team a 7-5 lead in the third period. Still, the Gauchos clawed their way back and managed to tie it 8-8 by the end of the third period.</p>\n<p>Despite a tied score heading into the match’s final period, UCSB’s performance fell victim to a sudden meltdown in the fourth. California scored the final four goals of the game, two by freshman attacker Johnny Hooper, who scored the opening goal of the fourth and the final goal.</p>\n<p>“Maybe I could have subbed more,” Wigo said. “We just weren’t that same team that we were in the first three periods and I thought it was fatigue. We dominated the first part of the game but then allowed easy goals, let them get back in and they just played a lot better in the second half.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos underwhelming fourth period proved to be the reason they lost against a great opponent. The same demise would haunt the Gauchos again in their next MPSF conference game against another formidable foe, the No. 5 Pacific Tigers.</p>\n<p>Unlike Saturday’s game, UCSB did not come out attacking aggressively to its capabilities. The Gauchos only mustered one goal in the first period and quickly found themselves down 2-1. UCSB seemed to be in a funk as it kept passing around the perimeter and forcing distant shots.</p>\n<p>Hauschild tried to break Santa Barbara out of its slump with an amazing deep goal as the shot clock expired. However, Pacific was just too dominant in the first half and ended the second period with a 3-0 run and a 5-2 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s confidence entering the third period looked a lot like the team that was dominating California the game before. Led by Hauschild, Santa Barbara outscored Pacific 4-1 in the third period and tied the score, 6-6. The sophomore attacker scored an impressive two goals and assisted on one with a beautiful pass to junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, who put through the equalizer with just seconds left in the third.</p>\n<p>“We came out a little slow,” Hauschild said. “Pacific plays a full zone; they let us shoot. We were just too timid in the first half. I wanted to prove that we could shoot and shoot out of that zone.”</p>\n<p>However, another scoreless fourth period by UCSB helped Pacific coast to its 9-6 victory. The Tigers scored on their first possession thanks to a beautiful deep goal by sophomore attacker Devon Thumwood and never looked back. Sophomore attacker Blake Hokkanen sealed the victory with a goal late in the game’s ending, just as the shot clock expired.</p>\n<p>The loss was another disappointing outcome for UCSB as fatigue seemed to be the repeat culprit in the team’s downfall. The same team that played well in that third frame completely disappeared in crunch time.</p>\n<p>“We struggled on offense but played well on defense,” Wigo said. “We have to finish out fourth quarters. After one game you never know but after two back-to-back games, we have to take a better look at that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will head out on the road to Malibu, California for the MPSF Southern California tournament. The tournament is to be held on Saturday, Oct. 10  and Sunday, Oct. 11.

The Golden Bears went 4-0 with wins by the score of 17-7, 15-4, 19-4 and 25-10.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took on the Golden Bears twice earlier this season and lost both times by the score of 12-5. The Gauchos will have revenge on their mind, while Cal will look to follow the same formula that allowed them to win the first two meetings handily.</p>\n<p>Pacific University currently has a record of 10-1 and is riding an absurd 10-game winning streak heading into the matchup. The Tigers have beaten six ranked teams on the season, with their only loss coming to Cal in their season opener.</p>\n<p>Kristzian Laczkovics will be key for Pacific this weekend as his 40 points and 18 assists lead the team on the season. The senior Attacker from Hungary will give the Gauchos’ defense fits if they are not able to stop him from creating opportunities for himself and his teammates.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first match begins Saturday at 12:00 p.m. at the UCSB Campus Pool against Cal. The Gauchos will play Pacific at 12:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of October 1, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/water-polo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/water-polo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/water-polo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/water-polo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/water-polo/","id":5016,"author":{"id":321,"name":"Jack Mathews"},"related":[5015,5014,5013],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
