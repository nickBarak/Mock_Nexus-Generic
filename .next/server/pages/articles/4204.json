The case alleges that Shehadeh owes Icon <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ikes-lawsuit.pdf\">more than $42,000 in overdue rent</a>, according to public records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reached out to both Icon’s leasing office and its legal team several times, but did not receive any comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a separate interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Shehadeh said he recently filed a countersuit against Icon, alleging that “[Icon] did some things that we didn’t appreciate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh’s countersuit alleges that Icon breached his lease agreement and committed fraud in the form of concealment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a court document sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Shehadeh’s attorney, the countersuit alleges that Icon hid important information following a situation involving mold on the premises, resulting in the eventual litigation currently taking place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After informing Icon in January of 2018 that he would no longer be leasing the store, “Icon negotiated with Ike’s Place to amend the lease” and remain in I.V., according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that following the repair of a faulty hose in the soda dispenser at the I.V. location, Icon, “unbeknownst to Ike’s Place… hired ATC Group Services LLC to perform a mold inspection in the neighboring property…” that same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within that same week, ATC Group Services allegedly reported that the mold found on the premises was coming from Shehadeh’s store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report claimed that the faulty hose was to blame for the mold but, allegedly, nobody from ATC Group Services contacted the store to inform Shehadeh there was a presence of mold on the premises. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the court document alleges that Icon had knowledge of mold on the premises prior to the faulty hose in the I.V. location’s soda dispenser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the soda dispensary machine at the I.V. location had allegedly been inspected just “weeks prior” and the health inspector “did not find any issues with that machine,” according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Shehadeh entered negotiations between Jan. 19 of 2018 and Jul. 4 of 2018 to extend his lease with Icon, the leasing agency allegedly “did not disclose this mold report to Ike’s Place,” according to the court document: “had Ike’s Place known that Icon intended to blame mold damages in the Premises upon Ike’s place, then Ike’s Place would have been able to obtain contemporaneous evidence that it was not responsible for said damages.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh eventually decided to terminate his lease with Icon during the negotiation period but received an email in which Icon offered to “modify the amendment for the reduced gross rent,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within weeks, Shehadeh agreed to extend the lease, ending negotiations with Icon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegedly, “almost immediately” after Shehadeh signed the extended lease, Icon began inspections to “establish the presence of mold that it was already aware existed but had not disclosed to Ike’s Place,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that “Intrusive remedial work” was performed on the I.V. store following the inspection, ceasing store operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, biohazard signs were scattered throughout the store, bathrooms were closed, the kitchen was sealed off and the I.V. location was unable to make and serve sandwiches, according to the court document.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ike’s place was unable to continue to do business at the level it previously did and was accordingly unable to pay rent,” the court document states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By leaving the I.V. store uninformed about the mold, the court document alleges, Icon breached “the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it concealed material facts from Ike’s place.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. store claims, in the court document, that it was “harmed” by Icon due to its reliance on false information the leasing agency provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Icon’s suppression of material facts was malicious and egregious such that Icon should be liable for punitive damages,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document adds that the I.V. location is seeking compensation for “punitive damages,” the cost of the suit, attorney’s fees and “general, special, compensatory, incidental, consequential and/or economic damages…”</span></p>\n<p><b>New State Street Store:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new shop slated to open next week, Shehadeh circumvented the short hiring window by offering all current employees at the I.V location a chance to work at the new store. Furthermore, the store will be managed by one of Ike’s first-ever managers, who will bring roughly 10 years of experience to the new sandwich parlor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State Street location is equipped with a parking lot, which allows for a full-size catering menu, decreased wait times for delivery and parking for both employees and customers, according to Shehadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Shehadeh also plans to keep the lights on late into the night, flirting with new store hours such as “10 to 10” on weekdays and “10 to midnight” on weekends. However, the hours will be adjusted according to demand, as Shehadeh finds that there’s no use in staying open if nobody wants to purchase food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further compensate for the move, Shehadeh is excited to offer a “super student discount,” where both Santa Barbara City College and UC Santa Barbara students can tack on chips and a drink to their meal for “a buck fifty.”</span></p>\n<p>The court filings in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD include graffiti abatement, an AmeriCorps partnership and a resource center for survivors of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director and former president Ethan Bertrand gave the floor to those attending after he explained the budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Reynolds, policy analyst for Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), proposed funding be directed toward peer advocates for Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA). Peer advocates help survivors of sexual assault navigate their options and are required to undergo 60 hours of training beforehand, according to Reynolds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Campus Advocacy Resources and Education Center (C.A.R.E.) funds the training for UCSB students but not for volunteers outside of UCSB. SASA recommends funding be directed toward establishing training as a paid position, so as to compensate volunteers for their time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member also proposed the money be used to create a community counseling center for drug addiction, homelessness and suicide intervention, along with a mental health assessment survey of Isla Vista, in which a survey would be sent out to gauge the mental health of I.V. residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also multiple complaints by people concerning the difficulty of negotiating with landlords, leading to discussion about a greater need for tenant resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public safety was a large concern among many in attendance. The need for better lighting, particularly in the farther reaches of I.V., was voiced by several attendees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Robert Geis believes a greater community voice is needed for change to happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say, you know, there’s a member of our board that’s really interested in lighting and leading the charge to get better lighting out here and we’ve done the survey and stuff. But the one thing the community can do is be louder that the lighting is insufficient here,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve met with officials that say, ‘Ah, it’s been like that. We can’t do that.’ No. This is what the community wants, and I think we need to make that message clear.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency preparedness was another problem that was raised. Attention was then brought to the Thomas Fire and the lack of communication surrounding it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggestions were made to keep Deltopia local and quiet, so as to not attract outsiders. One solution was raised to have a community festival, but attracting more out-of-towners was still a concern. Planning Deltopia into being a more controlled event is a primary goal for I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those unable to attend the public forum budget meeting, project proposals can also be </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTTQt6hc1sAxwWpX94fvHhte7EaAPTT1euio6enUPZqCfCeg/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitted online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a survey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A preliminary version of the budget will be released at the <a href=\"https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/files/9590f8912/4_23_2019+Regular+Meeting+Agenda-2.pdf\">next I.V.
