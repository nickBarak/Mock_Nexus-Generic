Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The position Bertrand is running for is the “alternate special district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county.</p>\n<p>As people move into cities, the LAFCO makes sure spaces remain open and resources are protected. An alternate member takes part in LAFCO affairs when the regular members cannot be present or need to recuse themselves. For each meeting attended, the member makes $150 without benefits.</p>\n<p>Bertrand secured the nomination with four “yes” votes, one “no” vote and two abstentions.</p>\n<p>If Bertrand had not voted for himself and instead abstained, he would not have received the nomination.</p>\n<p>The FPPC didn’t offer a direct opinion on the matter since “only an investigation determines whether violations have occurred.”</p>\n<p>“Generally speaking, the responsibility is on public officials to avoid conflicts,” Jay Wierenga, the FPPC communications director, said in an email. He went on to say officials are recommended by law to avoid “even the appearance” of conflicts.</p>\n<p>David Seymour, another nominee for the LAFCO position, did recuse himself when his special district, the Santa Ynez CSD, voted to nominate him. Seymour, a 14-year veteran of the Santa Ynez CSD, left the room while the vote took place.</p>\n<p>“I had to leave, I left, I recused myself,” Seymour told the <em>Nexus.</em> “I can’t vote for myself. By going to LAFCO, there’s financial conditions and so you can’t do that. That’s against the law.”</p>\n<p>At Tuesday’s CSD meeting, Bertrand introduced his intent to run for the vacant position on the Santa Barbara LAFCO. While fellow directors Robert Geis and George Thurlow immediately mentioned and seconded a motion to place him in the position, Bertrand faced hesitation from director Jay Freeman.</p>\n<p>Freeman told the board it should throw its support behind Seymour, citing Seymour’s experience in and around LAFCO through the years.</p>\n<p>To that end, Freeman noted LAFCO’s emphasis on nitty gritty aspects of the larger county and said it would look bad if the I.V. CSD nominated someone who hadn’t attended enough LAFCO meetings.</p>\n<p>Going for this position would spread Bertrand too thin, Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“I like that you’re excited to do this, but it seems like a stretch given all you’re doing here,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand defended his qualifications, saying the LAFCO needs more younger folks and people of color in the way of diversity.</p>\n<p>He later told the <em>Nexus</em> that he has attended “quite a few” LAFCO meetings “over the past couple of years.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow stepped in, telling Bertrand to step down from facilitating the discussion since he had a direct interest in the outcome.</p>\n<p>Particularly, Thurlow said Bertrand should recuse himself from running the meeting, but “not necessarily from voting.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Bertrand stood by his decision to vote on the matter.</p>\n<p>“I still believe that what I did was within my rights and responsibilities,” he told the <em>Nexus</em>. “I’m still comfortable with it.”</p>\n<p>He directed the<em> Nexus</em> to the CSD’s legal counsel for further questions. G. Ross Trindle, who serves as the CSD’s legal counsel and sits in on most meetings, was not present Tuesday night for the board’s discussion.</p>\n<p>In the actual election between Seymour, Bertrand and any others nominated by their special districts, it would be the districts themselves that decide who gets the position.</p>\n<p>There are 37 special districts in the county and each of them will have a vote.</p>\n<p>In a similar situation in January, recently-elected Santa Barbara Mayor Cathy Murillo voted to replace a fellow city councilmember with herself on a countywide transportation board, <a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/santa_barbara_city_council_yanks_jason_dominguez_from_key_transportation_pa\">Noozhawk</a> reported. The council’s final vote was 3-2 and Murillo’s vote for herself ensured her board membership.</p>\n<p>Members on the board in question make between $2-3,000 per year, according to data provided by <a href=\"https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/santa-barbara-county-association-of-governments/?page=3&amp;s=-gross\">Transparent California</a>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The story previously referred to the LAFCO position as a “paid position with Santa Barbara County.” While it oversees the entire county, LAFCO is not directly tied to the County of Santa Barbara. </em></p>\n<p><em>In addition, the story previously said Bertrand told the </em>Nexus <em>he attends LAFCO meetings quite often. His exact words were, “I have attended quite a few over the past couple of years.” </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Del Playa Rentals proprietor’s arraignment had been delayed five times, but on Thursday his lawyers offered a not guilty plea after unsuccessfully arguing to have the case dismissed. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-11/isla-vista-landlord-yells-homophobic-slurs-at-i-v-csd-president-on-state-street/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a November incident captured on video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Gelb persistently called Bertrand a “fag” and made lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told Gelb he was unkind to his residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, the president of the I.V. Community Services District, is openly gay. His friend recorded the video, which was shared widely on the internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">District Attorney Joyce Dudley </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/isla-vista-landlord-charged-with-criminal-complaint-after-yelling-homophobic-slurs-at-csd-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indicted Gelb on a misdemeanor charge of “disturbing the peace”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November. His arraignment was then <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/\">delayed five times</a> over a four-month span until Gelb’s representation pleaded not guilty on Thursday. Gelb was not present in court for the arraignment and has not appeared at any previous hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griselda Carreon, associate attorney for Lynn &amp; O’Brien, LLP, argued in court to have the case dismissed, citing reasons that included Gelb’s right to free speech and the notion that the specific offensive language in question had not been specified by the prosecution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prosecutor Carl Barnes noted that other crimes, like battery, do not specify the precise nature of the harm committed. He pointed to the online video as a clear representation of the words used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superior Court Judge Raimundo Montes De Oca pointed out a line in the California penal code, which states, “offensive words in a public place which are inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction” can be designated as a crime against public peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carreon argued the language was not likely to provoke violence, referring to Bertrand having told police that he had sought to de-escalate the situation and was a person who believed in nonviolence. She also said the video was “unauthenticated” and “may have been clipped.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said Bertrand and “his buddy” had “laughed, smirked and continued to taunt Mr. Gelb.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca denied the demurrer, a request to dismiss the lawsuit, on the basis that the police report offered clear discovery of the crime Gelb was being accused of, as well as a shortage in facts that are necessary to compel a case dismissal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca set a pre-trial conference date for June 4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unfortunate to see the various excuses for horrible behavior that have come up during this process,” Bertrand told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response to the notion that he had “taunted” Gelb. “But I continue to believe that people must be held accountable for their actions against the LGBTQ community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, who has attended every hearing since Gelb’s first arraignment date, praised the “many community leaders” who have made statements in support of the LGBTQ+ community in the aftermath of the incident.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gelb’s attorneys from Lynn &amp; O’Brien have not responded to requests for comment. Barnes also declined to comment after the arraignment.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Bertrand used the word “unfortunate,” not “unfair.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

CSD manager. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The tenant-landlord mediation services will foster better relationships between tenants and landlords in I.V. and work out resolutions for disputes, according to Jonathan Abboud, I.V. CSD general manager.</p>\n<p>The program will cost approximately $33,000 which covers the launch date through the end of December 2018, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>Funding for this program will come from the $200,000 grant awarded to the I.V. CSD from UC Santa Barbara each year. The cost of the project includes payment of the mediator, bilingual assistant, project management, office supplies and insurance.</p>\n<p>The program will operate in the I.V. Community Room on Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Fridays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. During these hours, landlords or tenants can set mediation appointments through an online form found on the I.V. CSD’s website.</p>\n<p>Once a form is submitted, Abboud will contact both parties to schedule an appointment. Mediation is voluntary for both parties, so the scheduling of an appointment would be contingent on the motivation of each party to resolve their conflict.</p>\n<p>During the appointment, a mediator will discuss tenancy issues and help both parties work toward a resolution. The mediator will introduce the rules and conditions of the mediation and act as a neutral party between the landlord and tenant.</p>\n<p>Any discussion during the session is confidential, according to Sayre Macneil, mediator for the CSD.</p>\n<p>After the session, users will complete an evaluation form that the CSD will use to monitor the helpfulness of the program.</p>\n<p>Community members can drop in for counsel on tenancy issues if they cannot schedule an appointment, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>The program is available for all community members in I.V. This service will not be available for students living in UC Santa Barbara housing, including the Santa Catalina Residence Hall, San Joaquin Villages, Santa Ynez, San Clemente Villages and Storke Family Housing.</p>\n<p>The CSD held a forum Monday to introduce the program and its mediator to the public. Macneil spoke about his experience in mediation and his preference for mediation over court action in resolving conflict.</p>\n<p>Macneil says mediation is a more humane avenue of settling disputes as opposed to using the court system, which can often be time consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>Macneil has been a practicing attorney since 1984 and received a certificate in Mediation and Dispute Resolution at the UC Santa Barbara Extension program.</p>\n<p>He said he has worked on several mediation cases involving landlord and tenant relationships and has identified systemic problems throughout these relationships that repeat themselves in individual cases, such as loss of security deposit, maintenance needs and communication issues.</p>\n<p>He said that solving disputes is often a matter of providing a space for people to express and acknowledge grievances as well as to hear the other party in a non-threatening way.</p>\n<p>“When they can understand that the other side has some legitimacy to their point of view, a resolution is 20 minutes away,” Macneil said.</p>\n<p>The program also includes a bilingual translator to assist mediation with Spanish speaking residents.</p>\n<p>Undocumented families living within I.V. might have more challenges in resolving tenancy issues and enforcing their rights due to their vulnerability as undocumented immigrants/citizens, Macneil said.</p>\n<p>“There are things that make these circumstances such that people need some education in the process about what their rights are,” Macneil said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
