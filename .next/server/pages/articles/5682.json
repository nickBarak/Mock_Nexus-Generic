With this movie, we get to watch Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) make his big comeback in Hollywood stardom after struggling to find decent work as an aging, one-dimensional actor. Intermingled with this fictional narrative is the appearance of actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), whose brutal murder history gets rewritten in a satisfying yet extremely violent way. While Tarantino weaves in lots of true, historical moments in the film, “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” is ultimately an exaggerated, daydream version of an idealized 1960s Hollywood; one in which second chances are given and justice is served to those who deserve it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>2. Spider-Man: Far From Home</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off: thank goodness this movie was filmed before the whole Sony and Disney debacle. While Marvel superhero movies can often feel cheesy and unoriginal, “Spider-Man: Far From Home” presented audiences with just the perfect amount of cheese, a brilliant cast and a crazy nail-biting twist ending that no one saw coming. As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) decides to take a break from his superhero duties and enjoy his school trip abroad to Europe, he befriends Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) and finds himself, you guessed it, fighting crime once again in his Spider-Man suit. Besides Holland and Gyllenhaal, Zendaya also shone bright in this film as her character, Mary Jane, finally got more screen time and even helped Spider-Man discover who the villain was. Overall, “Spider-Man: Far From Home” is one of the few superhero movies to come out this year that I’m confident any person could enjoy.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3. Toy Story 4</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was this movie necessary? No. Was this movie fun to watch and enough to satisfy your nostalgic need to cling onto iconic childhood characters? Yes. “Toy Story 4” captures another toy adventure sans Andy and reunites Woody with his love interest, Bo Peep — it’s that simple. Unlike “Toy Story 3,” the villain here turns out to be quite redeemable and even gets her own happily-ever-after ending. There’s not much to say about this movie, much like “Toy Story 3,” as it doesn’t measure up to the first two in the Toy Story film franchise but is still entertaining to watch. At this point, the Toy Story legacy has nothing new or special to offer its original audience besides these sequels that seem to do nothing but remind you how old you are.</span></p>\n<p><strong>4. Child’s Play</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I absolutely despise this recent rise in reboots and remakes, I felt this new version of “Child’s Play” held some kind of originality by altering the origin story of Chucky and thus changing the personality of this iconic horror character. Rather than just repeating the exact same story in the boring and overly-CGI fashion that most reboots tend to do, director Lars Klevberg instead gave horror fans an alternative version of the beloved Chucky doll. When compared to the original 1988 classic, this 2019 Chucky has a much more friendly approach to his murderous activities. Chucky simply just wants to be best friends with his child owner, and is willing to take out anyone who gets in the way of this mission. Although this version of “Child’s Play” is playing off of the success of the original franchise, I can at least admire the creativity that went into changing the essence of Chucky, both in terms of personality and looks. Plus, who doesn’t want to see a horror movie with Aubrey Plaza in it?</span></p>\n<p><strong>5. Avengers: Endgame</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a movie that’s three hours long and filled with so many beloved characters, I just expected to leave the theater feeling more impressed, which is why “Avengers: Endgame” is so low on this list. In the crossover of the century, “Avengers: Endgame” shows all our favorite Marvel heroes working together at a second chance of defeating Thanos through a confusing use of time travel. Overall, this movie seemed to fail in its own inconsistencies and overly-cheesy moments. Why does Iron Man get a whole funeral and Black Widow doesn’t? What does that mean for the past Captain America films if he has gone back in time to be with his love interest in the 1940s? Can snapping with the glove do anything you want or is it limited to just eliminating/un-eliminating 50% of all living beings on Earth? Could I read the comic books or online forums to get these answers? Maybe, but I won’t because the film should have handled these questions itself.</span></p>\n<p><strong>6. IT Chapter Two</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“IT Chapter Two” was one of my most anticipated films of 2019, however it turned out to be a major bust. This sequel takes us back to Derry after 27 years have passed where Pennywise has risen once again to wreak havoc. After an unnecessarily brutal opening to the movie, we see the kids of the Losers Club all grown up, living their separate lives all far apart from each other. Soon, the film seems to turn into a regurgitation of the first movie once everyone is reunited and is working together to take down Pennywise (again). The casting and acting of each character was amazing (probably the best part of the movie overall), but the film itself felt like nothing more than a compilation of flashbacks to the first film, finished off with a very lame and unfulfilling ending.</span></p>\n<p><strong>7. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who grew up reading the iconic “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” books, the film adaptation left little to be desired. This film follows a group of kids who venture into a haunted house and find a book in which the scary stories seemingly write themselves, and soon, everything that’s written in the book happens in real life. Along the way, we see iconic characters like Harold the Scarecrow terrorize the kids until eventually the movie runs out of characters and the movie ends. There were some genuinely scary parts of the movie that made it hard to not look away from the screen, but the CGI, generic dialogue and ineffective jump scares greatly tarnished the quality of the original “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” books and of the film at hand.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>8. The Lion King</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disney, just please for the love of god, stop rebooting everything. Thanks.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

It was Labor Day; we were in a cabin at Tahoe. I was unprepared, it was premature and yes, I bled. That weekend in sixth grade, I became the first of my friends to get my period. At a scrappy Chevron on the way home, my friend’s mom Lisa taught me how to put a pad on my underwear.<br><br>“Then you fold the wings down,” she yelled at me through the cracks of the public restroom. She paused, then lowered her voice to a whisper. “And you’ll <em>feel</em> it when it comes out.” <br><br>It sounded almost pleasurable, the prurient way she said it. I had dozed off during our barebones sex ed class in fifth grade, so upon first seeing those unfamiliar red spots on my ash-white shorts, my imagination ran rampant. I envisioned a sort of magical oil slick oozing neatly into a sanitary pad, to be expected and practiced as an annual fertility rite of womanhood. I surmised that it would happen twice a year, tops, probably aligning with the cosmic patterns of celestial orbs. There was probably a farmer’s almanac I could borrow at the middle school library to help me predict my period next year. Then, I learned that I come from a long line of uteruses that expel blood with the urgency of a firefighter’s hose. I adopted my mother’s many strategies: mesh underwear, double lining pads, sleepless nights on top of the dark towel. <br><br>That summer, my mom and I went on an impromptu European mother-daughter trip. In Rome, during a free Mozart opera concert that bored me to no end, my mom’s eyes widened slightly in surprise. She did not break her gaze from the warbling singers. “Aiya,” she said calmly. “The disaster has come.” I panicked for her. No, she said, she didn’t have any hygienic provisions with her. No, she didn’t have any black pants to change into. Yes, she had bled through. I looked at her khaki trousers that had seemed so smart and graceful moments earlier, and cursed them for her. We conspired to leave the concert with quick paces, me walking mere inches behind her like a sticky shadow.<br><br>Companies like Procter &amp; Gamble (which owns Always, Tampax, Naturella, and Whisper) target women of different countries with different products. The French want the least bulky, the Japanese want the softest material, and Americans want maximum security against leakage, regardless of cost in comfort. When we neared the light of street lamps, I could see the little stains on either side of her crotch, hiding in the creases of her pants as she walked, like a blinking, winking, eyebrow-raising face that mocked our embarrassment. Did the Italianos around us notice? Would they stand and point and laugh at her if they saw her stains? What if we were walking under American streetlights?<br><br>Menstruation is an ongoing civil war waged in between my legs, my ruined underwear its tired battlefield. Month after month, my body triumphantly declares victory over my will. I looked towards a higher power. What could calm the fury that overtook my body every 28 days? God, maybe, or yoga? I dabbled in both to no avail. My pediatrician warily prescribed me birth control and I started Sprintec, a waxy blue envelope of little round pills which is now my constant companion. Sometimes, when I forget to pepper the pill at precisely 9 p.m., I have my period for two straight months. I envied the women whose periods are so infrequent that they buy pregnancy tests. I envied Olympic gymnasts, whose extreme athleticism causes secondary amenorrhea. I envied those without uteruses and I resented their oblivion to our suffering. <br><br>I grew to dread my period, a deep self-hatred dappled with anxiety from frantically shuffling towards the bathroom with a hidden tampon up my sleeve or subtly glancing at my seat every time I stood up. Periods were terrible to start at school. By lunchtime, I’d convene with my friends. “I bled through,” I’d say glumly, defeated yet again. In a practiced ritual, they’d pat me on the shoulder with a sympathetic look. Lisa was right. I felt it. I felt too dirty to exist in public when I was bleeding. <br><br>We bargain with our reflections in the mirror, playing with the cards we were dealt: the cleft chin from your father, the curly hair from your mother, the hooded eyes, the pixie ears, the color of your skin in the winter. Variances of periods are many: menstruation can begin as early as age eight, lasts from two to seven days per cycle and occurs every 21 to 45 days. Periods can be viscous or thin, staining your favorite clothes any shade of crimson and brown. Thus, the period is the last manifestation of this genetic destiny, a hormonal sorting hat declaring your birth-given menstrual fate. As I anticipate the monthly shedding of my uterine lining, I’m reminded of my biological duty to reproduce, my position as almost-mother and future-mother and, at the risk of empathizing with the pro-life movement, my body’s power to create conscious life. No joy can be derived from apologizing for bleeding, sorry after sorry to my light-wash Levi’s and my Advil-scarred stomach. We do not shame the injured for their gushing wounds and broken bones, yet as I’m hurt, month after month, I nurse myself in secrecy. Menstruation is a woman’s first introduction to labor needlessly for the comfort of others.<br><br>When I was 17, I got a Diva Cup. The silicone wonder arrived at my door in a purple box with curlicue writing urging me to join the revolution: “A Better Period Experience,” it promised. The instructions are written in exquisite detail, specifying the locations of the labia and the cervix, as if its user did not know what a vagina is; the Diva Cup knew that many women are strangers to the intricate pains and pleasures of their own bodies. There was no shame in not knowing yet. Holding it by its ribbed stem, the cup is roughly tulip-sized and supple to the touch. Instructions demand some origami first: fold the cup in half from top down or into a U-shape. Then, a choreographed tango: angle the pelvis to the cup in sitting position as you insert, rotating it to ensure a solid seal. If vaginas were capable of feeling anxiety, mine did. As I pushed the Diva Cup in for its maiden voyage, I feared the worst. It might get swallowed up in that orifice and I might have to ask my mom to take me to the ER. It could crumble inside my vagina and probably somehow enter my bloodstream. The cup might turn over, liberating a deluge of blood in the middle of my Russian Literature seminar. It might hurt. Silly doubts, I realize now. The cup felt like nothing and my first period with the Diva Cup was a fucking miracle. Either God or yoga took pity on me; I was no longer drowning in a pool of my own blood and shame.<br><br>Oh, how can I count the ways I love thee, Diva Cup? Besides the physical security in its flawless, ingenious function, the cup is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, safe, comfortable, and convenient alternative. Am I a hormonal Diva for my unorthodox approach to reigning in my menstrual flow? Or is this cup the Diva that translates the dramatic theatre of my cycle to a secret power? I perused their website. “The name Diva originates in Italy, where it was used to describe a female deity, a powerful woman whose talent resembles that of the gods. In the 1800s the name Diva was used to describe a talented woman, leading the way in music and stage. What better way to empower women than by encouraging them to become a menstrual Diva – a leader in period care!”<br><br>Ah. I’m in a harmonious collaboration with menstruation. Ours is a masterpiece worthy of Carnegie and Pompidou. I feel it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kat Chen wants you to buy a Diva Cup for someone you love. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

impressive 2018-19 campaign. The Gauchos finished last season as the No. 5 team in the country with an 18-10 record, racking up several impressive wins over the course of the year. Some victories that stood out include 3-0 sweeps of No. 3 BYU on back-to-back days, a 3-2 win vs. No. 2 UCLA and a 3-1 win over then-No. 5 Loyola Chicago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the Gauchos will be without several key players who graduated, including standout outside hitter Corey Chavers, opposite Matt Ujkic and outside hitter/libero Hayden Boehle. Chavers led the Gauchos in 2019 with 370 kills with a season average of 3.4 kills per set. Boehle saw some notoriety for his impressive season, finishing as a finalist for the Erik Shoji Award, an honor given to the best Libero in all of collegiate men’s volleyball. Both Chavers and Boehle earned Second-Team All-American honors for their strong play in their final college season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the loss of these valuable pieces, UCSB should continue to play good volleyball, bringing back seven players for their fourth and final run as Gauchos. Notable returning seniors for UCSB include opposite Spencer Fredrick out of Lynwood, California, setter Casey McGarry and outside hitter Roy McFarland. My preseason presumption is that UCSB shouldn’t have many on-court chemistry imbalances or leadership blunders, given that these seniors have now been playing with one another for around four years.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with these seniors, an exciting prospect is returning to UCSB for his second season.

UCSB’s showing undoubtedly destabilized McKendree’s lineup, whose bleak presence was overshadowed by a seasoned Santa Barbara roster. With a steady flow of kills and a consistent system of defense across the UCSB starters, the team never dropped their lead throughout all 3 sets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a bold experimental lineup, Head Coach Rick McLaughlin tested Haotian Xia as an outside hitter and Roy McFarland as an opposite. The sophomore-senior corners took control of the offense, each contributing 10 kills. Senior McGarry also topped SB with 5 digs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Brandon Hicks executed a successful 8 kills out of 9 total attempts, finishing the game with the highest kill percentage of the day at .889. Hicks backed up his offensive performance with 3 block assists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This last game, however, was only the culmination of a rolling victory wave that had begun two days prior. In its opening match, UCSB faced Concordia-Irvine, who, in retrospect, posed the first and really only threat to their reign. Concordia fought back after their first 2 set defeats, pushing the third, though unsuccessfully, to an ultimate 24-26 loss. The game record played out favorably for the Gauchos as follows: 25-15, 25-16, 26-24.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, DeWeese made his 2020 debut as the Gauchos’ outside hitter, stepping away from his usual position as a setter. 14 kills later, the Sacramento native’s undeniable performance proved his seamless transition to his new spot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow seniors McFarland and Sanders backed up DeWeese’s intimidating presence, each racking up 7 kills apiece (with Sanders reaching a .700 kill percentage). Yould would earn a large part of his All-Tournament title here with an impressive 8 digs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGarry matched his teammate’s 8 digs in the Gauchos’ second game against Benedictine University, his highest dig count out of the three games. The Manhattan Beach local, named as well to the All-Tournament Team, finished the invitational with 17 total digs and an overall standout coverage of the court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The skill-packed, nationally-ranked Santa Barbara lineup was hardly a relief for the Benedictine Redhawks, who had come off of a loss against No. 5 Cal State Long Beach the day before. The Gauchos again swept Benedictine Mesa with ease, winning 25-12, 25-21, 25-18. Here, sophomore Ryan Wilcox stood out with 15 kills, the highest number among the team over the course of the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the Gauchos avoided more threatening competitors like Long Beach, they nonetheless will be bolstered by their electric debut. Their consistency across the board will be crucial as they look to the near future where the team will face increasingly more challenging opponents such as Stanford, USC and UC Irvine.
