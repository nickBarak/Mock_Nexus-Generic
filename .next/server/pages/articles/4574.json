Thousands of LED headlights were given out to attendees to promote rider visibility. <em>Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Campus and community organizations came together to host I.V. LUX, an event to promote bicycle safety, Wednesday at the Associated Students Pardall Center in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Host organizations included Associate Students Bike Committee (ASBC), Office of Student Affairs, the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Department, the Office of Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr and the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition. During the event, 1,500 LED bike lights were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis to local bikers, made possible by funds from ASBC and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Tiffany Yeh, ASBC Administrative Coordinator and third-year mathematics major, said the LED light giveaway was part of the Bike Committee’s plan to improve UCSB bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to change the bike culture here in I.V. and on campus,” Yeh said. “More specifically, right now, because there are so many accidents at night, we are handing out lights. In conjunction with that, we are giving out a lot of bike safety information and tips.”</p>\n<p>Yeh said ASBC also hopes to improve UCSB’s standing in the League of American Bicyclists’ Annual Bicycle Friendly University awards program, which celebrates universities that have a positive bike culture.</p>\n<p>“The Bike Committee is focused on creating and maintaining bike paths on campus and worrying about bike safety on campus,” Yeh said. “With this event, we are trying to include in our mission an education portion in order to get a [League of American Bicyclists] platinum standing. Platinum ranking is one of our goals this year.”</p>\n<p>Stacy Kowsz, ASBC graduate student representative, said improving bike safety education in the community is one way UCSB can move from gold to platinum level in the League.</p>\n<p>“Currently, we are gold, we want to be platinum. Currently, only a couple universities are platinum, like Stanford and Davis,” Kowsz said. “One of the things we are lacking that the platinum universities have is better education and bike safety. We have tons of people using bikes which is awesome and we do have great bike infrastructure, bikes have a strong presence, but what we don’t have is great bike safety. One of our goals is to improve the culture and make it more safe.”</p>\n<p>Debbie Fleming, senior associate dean of student life, said although there are many problems with bike safety in “a lot of different spots,” bike lights are one step toward a safer bike culture.</p>\n<p>“We thought about what we could do that would be positive, so we combined resources with the A.S. Bike Committee and the Dean of Students office to put some funds together to get some bike lights,” Fleming said. “One of the easiest things for people to do is just put a light on your bike at night.”</p>\n<p>According to Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell, the current culture in I.V. is such that cyclists do not feel the need to follow the same laws as cars.<br>\n“A lot of people don’t understand that bicycles are vehicles, and when you’re riding a bicycle, you have to obey the same traffic laws as you would in a car,” McKarrell said. “A lot of the issues we see are people running stop signs and failing to yield to pedestrians. What happens then is we have traffic collisions, mostly either bicyclists-on-bicyclists or bicyclists-on-pedestrians.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said there is a unique issue with the busy intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, where there is currently a two-way stop sign.</p>\n<p>“The problem with that intersection is there’s free-flowing traffic going east and west and the people traveling north and south have to constantly wait. The bicyclists traveling east and west are within their rights,” McKarrell said. “The only thing I can suggest to be more safe is to not cut behind cars, to maintain a safe speed and to maintain awareness of their surroundings.”</p>\n<p>McKarrell said a possible way to improve safety at this locations could be to create a new traffic control device, such as a stoplight or additional stop signs.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be looking at the intersection at Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte, and we’re going to see if a traffic control device would help cut down on the amount of accidents and the amount of problems we have at that intersection,” Mckarrell said.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, although it may be the busiest intersection, Pardall and Embarcadero del Norte is not the most dangerous intersection in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Believe it or not, as busy as that intersection is, it’s not as problematic as Camino Pescadero and Pardall,” McKarrell said. “I think it’s because there are a lot of blind spots there, and, again, it comes down to people not obeying the traffic signs, and they’ll pull out in front of other bicyclists or cars.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, March 3, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/i-v-lux-literally-sheds-light-on-bike-safety/","id":4574,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4573,4572,4571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Part One: Isla Vista Gets Down to Business","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A wide array of businesses are drawn to the busy streets of Isla Vista (I.V.), with new hopefuls arriving every year to compete for the interest of thousands of young adult customers.

From chains like Starbucks to independent establishments like I.V. Deli, the two-block downtown district in I.V. sustains nearly 50 independently and franchise-owned establishments. As businesses in I.V. begin to outgrow the humble beach town, business owners in I.V. continue to stay afloat.</p>\n<p>“The original concept was called ‘Blunts and Bagels’ and it was gonna be a dispensary bagel shop,” Daniel Dunietz, owner and founder of Buddha Bowls said. Captivated by the beach town’s creative and unique vibes, Dunietz knew he wanted to own and operate his own business in Isla Vista even before he attended UCSB.</p>\n<p>In December of 2013, Dunietz opened the doors to Buddha Bowls. The restaurant is a testament to his desire to make people happy through unique and satisfying food and was first opened under the expectation that marijuana would soon be legalized. Dunietz said he intends to incorporate marijuana into his business as soon as it becomes legalized, but said “up until now, all we can really do is help get signatures, help get measures through, help rally the students and really try to bring awareness to the importance of voting in the next election cycle.”</p>\n<p>While Dunietz has larger political ambitions in mind, he and other Isla Vista business owners are focused on the more immediate challenges of running a successful business in the community.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Downtown Business Owners Association was formed in 2015 to market I.V., protect businesses and deal with problems of parking and safety. The college-town atmosphere of Isla Vista makes working in the beach haven both social and engaging, but the isolated location suffers from a constantly increasing flow of students, high population density and the effects of a thriving party scene.</p>\n<p>“The sheer number of young people here, the energy, it’s a place that can really embrace something unique and different,” Dunietz said.  “It’s not somewhere that you have people that are set in their way, they’re new, they’re molding,” Dunietz said. The progressive ideologies and creative personalities of many students make I.V. a “perfect” place to operate a restaurant.</p>\n<p>Andrea Maasz, manager of Otaco, said there are sometimes issues with rowdy customers, but I.V. is one of the best places she has worked. According to Maasz, when planning for the opening of the restaurant, Otaco’s interior designers had to take into account the energy of I.V. customers and the “potential for mayhem” in the small area.</p>\n<p>“All our furniture is plywood because people will dance up on there. We’ve broken the stage last week and the music’s pretty loud, but overall it’s a lot of fun,” Maasz said. “People understand if something bad happens, and people are a lot of fun on the Wednesday karaoke nights; it gets crazy.”</p>\n<p>Al Espino, owner of organic hemp product store Hempwise, said he enjoys the constant influx of new people in I.V. because it creates an “ever-changing population.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve been in I.V. for 20 years; there’s a good and bad I guess.” Espino said. “It’s kind of like moving and getting a new location every few years.”<br>\nRico Ochoa Suave, manager of Pizza My Heart, said he has “seen it all” when serving I.V. customers, and appreciates the town as a lively environment for business.</p>\n<p>“It can get a little bit hectic maybe with alcohol, but it’s always a great place to be,” Suave said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68392\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68392\" data-attachment-id=\"68392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/part-one-isla-vista-gets-down-to-business/businesses_-by-vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Businesses_ by Vivian Bui-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68392\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=750%2C497\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"750\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Businesses_-by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Pizza My Heart employees must be prepared to handle situations involving intoxicated customers, but Suave said customers rarely need to be kicked out.</p>\n<p>Virtually all businesses in I.V. are squeezed into a few “downtown” blocks, stretching from 65 Pardall to 65 Trigo. The area is commonly packed with students commuting to and from campus and the congested area offers few options for parking. Beginning in 2015, I.V. stakeholders started holding weekly meetings to discuss solutions for more efficient traffic in the area.</p>\n<p>Jacob Bergam, manager of Bagel Café, said careless pedestrians and bikers and “horrible” parking create an unappealing shopping environment in I.V.<br>\n“As a result most non locals avoid making the trek to Isla Vista business,” Bergam said in an email.</p>\n<p>Marissa Bragstad, Isla Vista Food Co-op floor manager and outreach assistant, said non-student residents shop at the Co-op, but some of them may be “put off” from its location in Isla Vista, which is drastically different than the surrounding Goleta and Santa Barbara areas.</p>\n<p>“We do have some shoppers that have been shopping with us for over thirty years since the Co-op first started,” Bragstad said. “But sometimes it’s hard to maintain those customers since it is a different shopping experience from if you’re going out in Goleta or downtown Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>The majority of I.V.’s population flows in and out as college graduates move out of town to make place for incoming freshman. Due to the transient nature of I.V.’s residents, businesses are hard-pressed to retain customers and appeal to new residents.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Food Co-op, which first opened in 1972, has in recent years begun several programs to support I.V. and encourage community participation.</p>\n<p>“You may have a customer that shops here from their sophomore year to their senior year and then they go,” Bragstad said. “So we’re constantly trying to make people aware that we’re here.”</p>\n<p>Woodstocks General Manager James Glover said another downside of I.V.’s transient environment is the need to constantly rehire employees.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of long-standing folk. It sucks, you develop people, they turn into these badass adults and then fly off and do amazing things,” Glover said. “So it’s cool that that’s the case but it also sucks that you have to get rid of your best people sometimes, just out of the nature of being in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to fifth-year math major Donald Heatherington, the increase in chain businesses was inevitable because smaller businesses have difficulty surviving in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It’s gone from smaller, family-owned businesses to larger chains. I’ve seen a lot of businesses fail in I.V. or maybe only stay for a couple of months,” Heatherington said. “The economic climate and student schedules and tastes are pretty unpredictable, so it kind of makes sense.”</p>\n<p>Hempwise owner Espino said student traffic, which is highly dependent on the university schedule, creates a difficult business pattern.</p>\n<p>“The bad is there is a lot of downtime with all the holidays; it’s pretty much kind of stuck to the school schedule, so during any holidays it’s real quiet; during finals and test times, it’s quiet,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Espino said Hempwise does not have as large as an advertising budget as other businesses, and instead relies on more inexpensive, “less mainstream” forms of promotion.</p>\n<p>“We definitely have tried to focus more on more grassroots promotion like flyers and handouts, you know, word of mouth and things like that as opposed to other years where we would do more blanket advertising through the Independent and even the Daily Nexus, which we’re not really doing so much anymore,” Espino said.<br>\nDunietz said he has not changed his business model since he opened because his business has been successful despite changes in I.V.’s environment and increased competition.</p>\n<p>“There could be a hundred new restaurants opened up and I still feel I could succeed because if you do the right thing and you attract the right kind of customers, you’ll be all right,” Dunietz said.</p>\n<p>Check out the Daily Nexus next week for the second part of our series dedicated to Isla Vista businesses.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 in the Thursday, Friday 18, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We could then implement a parking program in that area, only for those blocks and the residents on those blocks.”</p>\n<p>David Lackey, Santa Barbara County Planning and Development staff member, said the parking program’s effect on coastal access is vital to its success in the community.</p>\n<p>“When creating the parking program, you want to have some updated coastal access survey data,” Lackey said. “The Coastal Commission — what they are going to be looking at in permit issues is if what you are proposing will have any type of impact to any coastal success users.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68731\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68731\" data-attachment-id=\"68731\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/stakeholders-discuss-assessment-of-i-v-s-parking-needs/stakeholders_by-spencer-brandt-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders March 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68731\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"Stakeholders March 1\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stakeholders_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lackey said the information from the survey revealed most beach-goers are local residents who walk to the beach and do not use parking.</p>\n<p>“Surprising, the data we got was certainly favorable and the majority of the users either walked or lived within the community,” Lackey said. “A very small percentage came out of the community and parked there.”</p>\n<p>According to Lackey, since the program is time-sensitive, receiving up-to-date information is key to its success.</p>\n<p>“Based on the timing, you would want to have any additional information that is current.

id=\"caption-attachment-67369\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Giovanni’s Pizza Restaurant, locally known as Gio’s, will be permanently closed on Thursday, Jan. 14 after seven years under current owner Matt Metzka’s management.</p>\n<p>Established in 1982, Gio’s was purchased by Metzka in 2009. Metzka will be permanently closing Gio’s this week after losing a legal battle to renew his lease for the restaurant. The current lease owners have not disclosed their future plans concerning the property, and Metzka is debating opening another business in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Metzka said the legal battle was quietly “going on for years,” and he wished the situation had worked out differently.</p>\n<p>“I wish that there was other opportunities to work with the landlords, but they don’t want me in the building,” Metzka said.</p>\n<p>Metzka said he is unsure of what will happen to the building, the property or his staff after the restaurant closes.</p>\n<p>“They may tear the building down. They might try to run another restaurant. I don’t know what they’re going to do. I have no say,” Metzka said. “If they lease it to somebody else and approach my guys and say ‘hey, do you want to work for me,’ obviously they could.”</p>\n<p>Metzka is debating on whether to buy or lease another property in I.V., but said he has no potential time frame for when that may happen.</p>\n<p>“I mean this is what I do. I have talked to a couple other business owners around who are selling,” Metzka said. “I’m just trying to de-stress from all of this and evaluate. At the end of the day, I don’t know what’s going to happen.”</p>\n<p>If he decides to run another business in I.V., Metzka said he is unsure about opening another pizza place.</p>\n<p>“After having Sorrisos, Blaze and Pizza my Heart open up in 2012 and 2013, it’s like ‘Really? You already had Woodstocks, Domino’s, Pasta House and Rusty’s delivering in I.V. in 2009,’” Metzka said. “There’s seven pizza places now, the burrito places are almost as bad.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said the new property owners have the option to rebuild and remodel the building.</p>\n<p>“Someone might try to come in and run Gio’s, another type of Gio’s,” Metzka said. “Someone might come in and totally change the concept or demolish the building and make a three-story building. In fact, if I was building, that’s what I would want.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said he has met amazing people during his seven years of working at Gio’s, and will miss his interactions with staff the most.</p>\n<p>“The guys in the kitchen. Some of these guys have worked here forever. Marco, Pedro, these guys have been here five, six years,” Metzka said. “My morning chef has been here for 18 years. That’s why the food here is always so good, because the guys in the kitchen have worked here forever. I don’t change my kitchen.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67370\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67370\" data-attachment-id=\"67370\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/gios-closing_by-eric-swenson-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452714931\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gio’s Closing\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67370\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67370\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Gio’s employee and SBCC student Erin Lambie said even though she has only been working since October, she is incredibly saddened by the Gio’s closing.</p>\n<p>“It’s so sad. Just seeing how big it gets during big games and trying to talk to people like ‘Wait, what did you say? I can’t hear you,’” Lambie said. “It’s weird, but it gets so exciting. Or they call you and ask what the deal on the pitchers are and you’re like ‘they’re $6, ‘and they’re like ‘Oh my god it’s Disneyland.’”</p>\n<p>Metzka said the day before he announced the restaurant’s closure, his previous Instagram post had 14 likes and no comments. The day after he posted the closure, he received over 250 likes and 300 comments.</p>\n<p>“I mean, talk about beyond moved. I mean we’re talking about countless comments,” Metzka said. “We’re talking frowny faces and ‘I met my best friend here.’ It’s never going to be the same. These comments are fucking amazing.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Conner Jainese said the closing of Gio’s is a “tragedy” in I.V.<br>\n“Honestly, it’s the stronghold of Isla Vista and the only place where you can get a slice and a pitcher without breaking your wallet,” Jainese said.</p>\n<p>Kaylie Roujmer, fourth-year biochemistry major, said she originally thought Gio’s closing post on Instagram was a joke to get more business.<br>\n“I thought it was just a prank, like ‘No, Gio’s can’t be closing.’ Gio’s is one of the best places to get food and people just don’t believe it’s happening. I’ve even heard of people thinking of creating a petition to try and stop it from happening.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said people have been approaching him since he made a Facebook page announcing the restaurant’s closure.</p>\n<p>“I had like 30 or 40 people walk up to me and they were like ‘what the fuck?’ And I was like ‘I know,’” Metzka said. “They were like ‘this isn’t okay’ and honestly, I don’t know what to tell you.”</p>\n<p>Jainese said it was also difficult for him to believe that Gio’s will be permanently closed after Thursday night.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s one of those comedy movies where everyone gathers in the library to meet to figure out a way to save their favorite hang-out place. Everyone would use their majors and show how Gio’s has affected them to save the restaurant.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said some of his favorite weekends to work were graduation weekend, alumni weekend and Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“It was super fun. We had the last Floatopia in 2009,” Metzka said. “Then after that, when it became Deltopia, I used to go to Kmart and buy a big kiddie pool for the patio and fill it with water then say ‘oh, it’s the beach.’”</p>\n<p>Hope Curran, fourth-year global studies and art double major, said she spent a lot of time celebrating different parties and events at Gio’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge part of the I.V. community. Especially people over 21 come here to have fun and chill and it’s actually a great alternative to partying on D.P. with minors,” Curran said. “It’s a much more relaxed environment, and socially, I feel it’s much healthier than what you can find in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said one his favorite memories during his time at Gio’s was when a couple of girls walked in “stoned” and stood at the counter for six minutes in “dead silence.”</p>\n<p>“Me and my staff stared at them the whole time, waiting patiently. After silent menu-looking, they look at me they go ‘so how much is that so far?’ Like sweetie, no you haven’t ordered. And they’re like ‘oh fuck’ and go straight back into staring,” Metzka said.</p>\n<p>Metzka said he moved to Santa Barbara in 2000 and lived in I.V. from 2000 to 2003 before buying Gio’s in 2009.</p>\n<p>“I’m your poster child for ‘don’t go to college, don’t incur a whole lot of debt, work your ass off and buy something,’” Metzka said. “I did finish UCSB extension for a licensing certificate. I did some stuff there but college and I aren’t friends.”</p>\n<p>Metzka said he chose to buy Gio’s after spending time there with his friends when he first moved to the area.</p>\n<p>“I used to come to Gio’s and I used to eat burgers and have a beer and watch the game,” Metzka said. “This was always the spot. It was always the hang our spot. It was the biggest place in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Natalie Tran, fourth-year psychology major, said Gio’s is a landmark of I.V. and she is going to miss the restaurant’s atmosphere the most.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely the vibes, you know? You’re just not going to find that anywhere else,” Tran said. “Not at Hana Kitchen, not at Domino’s, just at Gio’s. It’s irreplaceable. I don’t even want to bike by it anymore. We’re going to miss it so much. Thank you, Gio’s.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/gios-pizza-to-close-after-34-years-in-business/","id":4573,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4572,4571,4570],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
