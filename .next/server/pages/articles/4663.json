Until the November 2016 voting period, studies will be conducted to determine how financially plausible this plan is.<em> Online Stock Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Governor Jerry Brown signed Assemblymember Das Williams’ Isla Vista self-governance bill, Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), into law Wednesday.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, I.V. residents will vote on the establishment of I.V. as a Community Services District (CSD) governed by a board of local representatives, which would determine local services and infrastructure projects. If approved by voters, the CSD would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Until November 2016 the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) will conduct an analysis of the financial feasibility of a CSD for I.V.</p>\n<p>Field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus Cameron Schunk said the next step for Williams’ staff will be to assist the Board of Supervisors and LAFCO in their feasibility study to provide reliable information for 2016 voters.</p>\n<p>“The way the bill is written, it goes to a vote regardless of what LAFCO’s analysis says,” Schunk said. “Our hope, though, is to work as closely with LAFCO as possible to get the best possible analysis, which provides usable and accurate information. This really gives voters confidence when they go to the ballot, one way or another.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, representatives from Williams’ office will continue to educate residents about the CSD in stakeholder meetings every Tuesday night in the I.V. Clinic.</p>\n<p>“As far as our Tuesday night meetings, we fleshed out a schedule of events where we will be delving deep into each of the services, fleshing out how the community would like to see them enacted, what sort of contract we would want to draw out and how much we would be looking to spend on various things,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said her office will be working to educate students about the advantages of a CSD in I.V.</p>\n<p>“A large part of this, of which the EVPLA office is going to take part, is voter education,” Dela Cruz said. “I hope to inform students of the benefits of AB 3 and also anything that might affect them.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said A.S. needs to continue providing support to the I.V. self-governance movement to ensure the success of the CSD campaign.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to support any people, power and financial resources we can to ensure that it’s a successful election and start it right,” Villarreal said. “There are people who haven’t heard [about a CSD], so we want to continue with the educational process.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud, the 50-year-old movement for I.V. self-governance recently gained momentum because of support from I.V residents, the university, elected officials and other local agencies.</p>\n<p>“In the past, there were entities purposely road-blocking the efforts — LAFCO and the university were actively against those efforts and Isla Vista was powerless against these established organizations,” Abboud said. “This go around, we have a lot of allies that have really assisted us in getting this through officially.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he is “cautiously optimistic” I.V. residents will vote in favor of a CSD.</p>\n<p>“I think that the community has had enough with the status quo,” Abboud said. “There’s a lot of energy to change the status quo and this is a chance to do so.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/","id":4663,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4662,4661,4660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Face Longhorns in Texas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team has embarked on its second road trip of the season this weekend traveling to Austin to play a three-game series with the University of Texas.

The Gauchos head into the series after a successful weekend as they are winners of four straight. Texas welcomes Santa Barbara having just snapped a four game losing streak with a decisive 6-1 victory against Texas Pan-American.</p>\n<p>“The key [to the weekend] is just to get our young guys to go play the game of baseball and not play Texas,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We need to have the attitude of Texas is playing us and we are playing the game of baseball and that is really the message to our guys. The pitching mound is still going to be 60 feet, six inches and first base is still 90 feet away.”</p>\n<p>Texas at 7-5 so far this season got off to a great start. The Longhorns began the year at 6-1 and swept Nebraska at home before hitting the losing streak against the likes of Sam Houston State and Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Longhorns are led by preseason All-American junior pitcher Corey Knebel. Knebel was named to the second team as well as the Stopper of the Year watch list and Golden Spikes watch list. So far this year, the closer has recorded three saves in 11.1 innings pitched and is just 11 saves away from passing Houston Street as the schools all-time saves leader. Knebel headlines a bullpen that has kept the Longhorns a perfect 7-0 when leading through six innings.</p>\n<p>The 8-4 Gauchos, currently in fourth place in the Big West, look to take advantage of the strong Texas pitching by continuing their hot hitting. Over the four game winning streak, the Gauchos have outscored their opponents 24-7, and in the last four games have twice won in their last at bat. The success of the offense stems from the ability to get the lead-off runner on board.</p>\n<p>“We like to get guys moving and run. We sacrifice bunted a lot last year and haven’t as much this year,” Checketts said. “Our first order of priority is to steal and if you can’t run on the pitcher or catcher the second option is to hit and run. If the guys got really good stuff we will go to sac bunting because we like to keep guys moving and put pressure on people.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is hitting a solid .280 on the year. Sophomore utility man Woody Woodward leads the team with a .438 average and a stellar .561 on base percentage. Woodward and sophomore centerfielder and leadoff hitter Cameron Newell lead the team with 10 and 11 runs scored, respectively, and are driven in regularly by the heart of the order thanks to consistent hitting from junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>“I imagine if we think the pitcher is going to be on his game and that it will be tough to put up a couple runs we will be bunting and stealing more than usual,” Trinkwon said. “But if he is off his game you may see us swing away.”</p>\n<p>The weekend matchups and projected starters are sophomore Austin Pettibone at 5p.m. on Friday, freshman Justin Jacome at noon Saturday and sophomore Andrew Vasquez at 10 a.m. on Sunday at the University of Texas’ Disch-Falk Field.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/","id":4660,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4659,4658,4657],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tax Proposed To Fund I.V.

With approximately 8,377 bedrooms and 215,862 square feet of commercial space in Isla Vista, IVRPD officials estimate the special tax could add $256,348.43 in annual tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, IVRPD will levy the tax for the next 10 years after June 2017. Registered voters will receive mail-in ballots 29 days before May 9, and the measure must attain a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>Property owners currently pay an annual rate of approximately $93 in special taxes. IVRPD runs on a $1.5 million budget.</p>\n<p>Rodney Gould, IVRPD general manager, said the additional special taxes could help pay for more park services, especially since the measure directs at least 50 percent of the tax revenue for capital improvements. He said IVRPD will then be able to address the “backlog of deferred maintenance” in I.V.’s parks.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board Chair Pegeen Soutar said she hopes the increase in funds could bring reclaimed water into I.V. through a contract with the Goleta West Sanitary District.</p>\n<p>Soutar first proposed the special tax measure in February 2016 in light of two key factors.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District proposed in April 2015 to proportionally raise water rates by drought level. According to Soutar, this means a $30,000 water bill would increase to $60,000.</p>\n<p>IVRPD officials also foresaw a decrease in tax revenue after the university purchased Tropicana Gardens in July 2015, an Isla Vista residence hall previously owned by a Chicago investor. UCSB is exempt from paying taxes for the property that it owns in I.V. due to state law.</p>\n<p>Despite the decrease in tax revenue, however, the university reached an agreement in which it pays IVRPD the amount lost in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, Isla Vista property owners will be paying the same amount on property taxes as in the 2015-16 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>As of now, property owners pay less on property taxes for the 2016-17 fiscal year because of a land ownership bond that ended in June 2016, paid back like a loan. IVRPD initially levied a property tax to purchase land in I.V., but it effectively paid off the bond in June 2016, and the tax is no longer implemented.</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the special tax is the same amount that property owners were paying to fund the bond. Thus, if the tax measure passes, property owners will see no change in their taxes from the previous fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“They carefully crafted this,” said Joan Hartmann, the chair of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors who consented to the special election. She suggested that because the tax rates are so similar, “this new tax is just a continuation of what people were already paying.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said she originally wanted to put the special tax on the June 2016 ballot, but was unable to get it organized in time. She and other board members then intended to add the measure to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>This plan soon came to a halt last summer, however, after organizers from Yes on E&amp;F — the campaign which sought to establish a Community Services District (CSD) and a utility users tax in Isla Vista — asked the IVRPD board not to add the property tax to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, one of the Yes on E&amp;F organizers, said they didn’t want to have two tax measures on the same ballot. This would have increased the likelihood of both measures failing, he said.</p>\n<p>Paola Dela Cruz, IVRPD board vice chair, said, however, that organizers were being detrimental to the community engagement process in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I thought that our conversations were already hurting relationships and were hurting our future engagement,” Dela Cruz said. “I was seeing, I think, some level of disrespect. I was seeing lack of collaboration.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said Measure F (the utility users tax measure) and the IVRPD special tax could have both passed, but the board ultimately opted to postpone for a later date.</p>\n<p>“IVRPD needs to be able to work with everybody,” she said. “I didn’t want the Park District to be the blame if [Measure] F failed.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD special tax did not appear on the November ballot. Measure F <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\">did not pass</a> on Election Day.</p>\n<p>Soutar told the Nexus on Tuesday that she foresees no opposition to the special tax, since the tax is no “additional burden” on property owners and since people are “partial to their parks.”</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can tailor this election to what’s strictly positive,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

(EPS) in association with Berkson Associates in May 2015 to conduct a study on the financial feasibility of different self-governance options for I.V.  An oversight committee comprised of representatives of various community demographics advised EPS in an effort to ensure the study accurately represents the fiscal needs and realities of I.V.</p>\n<p>EPS assessed possible services, costs and revenue sources of various options for self-governance in I.V., including a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Das Williams proposed the CSD as part of Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), signed by Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday afternoon. The study also investigated the feasibility of incorporating I.V. as a city or forming an Area Planning Commission (APC) and Municipal Advisory Council (MAC). The presentation addressed topics such as I.V.’s demographic breakdown, tax revenue and services.</p>\n<p>EPS representative Rebecca Benassini said part of I.V. is currently SB County Service Area 31 (CSA 31), which secures county funding. According to Benassini, I.V. could lose CSA 31 funding and county municipal services under the self-governance options studied, but would maintain other county-based services.</p>\n<p>“Those are the only two of all the services that are provided that we are talking about potentially affecting,” Benassini said.</p>\n<p>Benassini said an APC and MAC, which cannot raise revenue and do not have authority over land use, would be the “simplest” options and would maintain the highest level of county involvement.</p>\n<p>“Those two options are connected to county functions and county powers that don’t really require too much more in terms of formation,” Benassini said.</p>\n<p>If a CSD is formed through AB 3, it will require approval by potential residents through a vote. Residents would also vote on whether to implement a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which would tax residents a portion of their utilities such as gas and water.</p>\n<p>According to the study, an eight percent UUT would fully fund administrative costs with $255,000 remaining for further services, such as tenant-landlord mediation, non-sworn personnel patrol and building inspection. In addition, UC Santa Barbara has pledged an annual $200,000 to CSD services from 2017 to 2024 if AB 3 passes.</p>\n<p>Principal at Berkson Associates Richard Berkson said cityhood would give I.V. the most autonomy but would cause it to suffer a “shortfall” of approximately two million dollars in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>“It would require an additional special tax,” Berkson said. “That would be about $350 to $360 per bedroom per year to fill that gap.”</p>\n<p>According to Berkson, the sole purpose of the study is to inform I.V. residents about self-governance options.</p>\n<p>“We took as objective of an approach as week could,” Berkson said. “We tried to lay out the information so that you, the residents of Isla Vista, can make your own decisions.”</p>\n<p>UCSB history professor and Fund board member Alice O’Connor said the unveiling of the study was a “historically auspicious moment.”</p>\n<p>“It is part of discussion of governance in Isla Vista that dates back at least four decades,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>According to O’Connor, challenges I.V. has faced pressured residents to partake in a “concentrated” and “sustained” effort for self-governance.</p>\n<p>“It is a conversation about governance that has been galvanized by various tensions and events in the community, including police-community tensions, incidents of sexual violence and of course the devastating mass shooting that we went through,” O’Connor said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the diversity of the oversight committee, which he sat on, contributed “a lot of expertise” to the study.</p>\n<p>“We had elected officials, business owners, students, university officials that all came together to make this study very effective,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Field Representative with Williams’ office and UCSB alumnus Cameron Schunk said the study provides proponents of a CSD with information to be used in ongoing planning.</p>\n<p>“It really allows us to start the concrete planning and look at what we can do, and not just that, but how do we want to do it,” Schunk said. “Now we’re really going to be focusing on all the different services that could be provided by the CSD proposed in AB 3.”</p>\n<p>Associated Student External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the study will help voters in making the decision on whether to establish the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Now we have the educational information to provide voters with what they need,” Dela Cruz.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said students who have not followed the I.V. self-governance movement likely will not read the published study in its entirety, and she hopes to help distribute the information in a more accessible way.</p>\n<p>“I had a long time reading everything. It’s more than 100 pages, and the only reason I read it was because I’m EVPLA,” Dela Cruz said. “A UCSB student who is not involved in A.S. is going to have some trouble reading that.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said one way she plans to “disseminate” the information in the study is by encouraging professors like O’Connor to raise the issue of I.V. self-governance to their classes.</p>\n<p>“One way I plan to engage students in the voter education part of this is by reaching out to professors like her who can include this as a part of their course, or if they don’t, at least share it with students and encourage them to come,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Senate postponed its regular 6 p.m. meeting to 7:30 p.m. to allow senators to attend the presentation. On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double-major Nawar Nemeh said I.V. self- governance is “hard for senators to ignore” because most UCSB students live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It’s really interesting — the relationship between A.S. and Isla Vista,” Nemeh said. “It’s a responsibility of A.S. senators to come to this.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said it was “surprising” how much cityhood would cost based on the report, and he thinks a CSD is the “most progressive” governance option for I.V.</p>\n<p>“From my perspective we are trying to aim for the most localization possible, but that’s feasible without creating huge tax burden,” Nemeh said. “I think a CSD looks like the best option.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/finance-report-unveils-self-governance-study/","id":4662,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4661,4660,4659],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
