Entering the Triton Invitational with a 5-3 overall record this season so far, UCSB has only lost to teams that are ranked above them in the national rankings: No. 7 Michigan, No. 2 USC and No. 5 ASU.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, CSUN, after beginning the season 1-6, has strung together three wins in a row as they look to stay in good form. Since 2011, the Matadors have only beaten the Gauchos three times in 12 matchups.</p>\n<p>“They return all of their starters from last year, so they’re a little bit older of a team,” Kay said. “It’s important that we come out and focus on the defensive end to start, and everything from there will come.”</p>\n<p>The stout defense of UCSB will have to deal with CSUN junior attacker Katelyn Fairchild who has scored a team-high 23 goals this season in just 10 games. This is a Gaucho defense that held the Matadors to only four goals in both matchups last season. It will be a clash of youth and experience on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Following their matchup versus CSUN, UCSB will play in a rematch against either the No. 7 Wolverines or No. 23 Marist, who it faced during the Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was defeated by Michigan that weekend 7-4, so there is an opportunity to get even after being handed its first loss of the season by the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>“Excited about the possibility of facing either of those teams again,” Kay said. “We played [Michigan] tough the first time around.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the UCSB roster has been a work in progress this year. However, against great competition, they have been able to put together impressive results.</p>\n<p>“Every game that we play we’re learning something new about ourselves as a team,” Kay said. “The freshmen are getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>With all the freshmen on the team, the more experienced players have an expanded role in guiding the newcomers. Kay recently had an important conversation with seniors Sophie Trabucco and Jenna Solberg about this season and about their important roles.</p>\n<p>“Both [Trabucco and Solberg] have a big defensive presence for our team; they’re both very competitive and tough,” Kay said. “You can’t do it without players like that. It was really special to be able to share publicly how important that sort of player is.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is ready to get back in the pool for some more competitive action as they look to continue to improve their chemistry.</p>\n<p>“This weekend, the main objective is to learn how to play together a little bit more and start putting the pieces together,” Kay said. “It’ll be fun once we get a few more games under our belts and things will start clicking.”</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara finished in eighth place at the Triton Invitational out of 16 teams. This confident bunch is ready to improve upon that result in this year’s event with the help of the young, great freshmen and the reliable seniors.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Cal State Northridge Saturday at 12:30 p.m. in their first match at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75575\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75575\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/","id":4926,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4925,4924,4923],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini","biography":"Not available","articles":[1887,4900,4904,4905,4906,4907,4920,4921,4923,4924,4925,4926,4927,4928,4929,4930,4931,4932,4933,4934,5557],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Ends Winter Invite 4-2, Fall to Juggernauts No. 2 USC & No. 8 Michigan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opening this season at home at Campus Pool hosting the UCSB Winter Invitational, the No. 9 UCSB women's water polo team concluded the weekend with a solid first impression despite two losses.

The first half ended with UCSB on top 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put on a beautiful display of attacking in the third quarter. They outscored Cal Baptist 6-2 in the period to give them what appeared to be a comfortable 10-5 lead heading into the fourth.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist exploded with three goals in the first three minutes of the final quarter. However, freshman utility Sarah Snyder responded by netting her third and fourth goals of the game for the Gauchos. UCSB earned their first win of the season in their Winter Invitational debut 13-8.</p>\n<p>Later that Friday afternoon, UCSB went up against Indiana in a top-15 battle. UCSB was first on the board thanks to senior captain Taylor Shore. Moments later, Snyder scored her fifth total goal of the day. Indiana returned the favor with two goals of their own to end the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>The second quarter passed in the same fashion as the Gauchos scored the first two goals before the Hoosiers answered with a pair of goals to tie it up.</p>\n<p>That was the last of Indiana’s scoring for the game, because UCSB didn’t concede a goal for the entire second half. Sophomore utility and former Hoosier Kate Pipkin scored two goals in the second half against her former team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the day with an 8-4 victory, looking confident for the games ahead.</p>\n<p>Day two of the Winter Invitational brought better weather and provided a tougher opponent in No. 8 Michigan. This was a defensive battle from the start. The first quarter came to a close with the score of 1-1 in an even matchup.</p>\n<p>The second quarter began with a quick goal from the Gauchos when freshman utility Abbey Grosse gave a nifty lob pass over the defender to Taylor Shore, who slotted it home for the goal.</p>\n<p>With about two minutes left in the half, the Wolverines scored to even it up at 2-2. The Gauchos went on to earn a power play with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half as head coach Serela Kay called a timeout. The ensuing play led to Shore finding the prolific Snyder for the goal to take the lead at 3-2.</p>\n<p>Michigan quickly responded with a lob shot attempt that landed on the line of the goal as the buzzer sounded, resulting in a no goal call from the referees.</p>\n<p>Michigan threw in three goals in the third as they began to pull away. UCSB found themselves down 4-5 heading into the final period.</p>\n<p>The Wolverine defense stepped up in the fourth period, making it difficult for the Gaucho attack time and time again. UCSB was unable to score in the quarter and was defeated 4-7.</p>\n<p>“The Michigan game really sticks out in my mind because we controlled the game all the way until the fourth quarter,” said Kay. “We’re young, so the fourth quarter moments and game situation moments are really important for us.”</p>\n<p>About an hour later, UCSB had to jump back in the pool for another game as they faced off against the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. The Gauchos dominated from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Natalie Selin scored a first quarter hat-trick as the Gauchos led 5-1 at the end of the opening quarter.</p>\n<p>Early in the third quarter, Shore earned another hat-trick as UCSB went up 9-3. Pomona-Pitzer added a couple more goals to their tally, but UCSB eventually earned their third win of the weekend by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The final day of the Winter Invite was layered with heavy rain and constant winds when UCSB squared off versus Marist, which scored double digit goals in its first two games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stayed with their defensive theme in this game, holding the Red Foxes to only two goals in the first half. UCSB’s balanced attack resulted in seven goals to make it 7-2 at the break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to make it difficult for Marist, which could only total five goals in the entire contest. Snyder and Shore stayed on their terrific goal-scoring pace, each scoring in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished off the Red Foxes by the score of 11-5 to earn their fourth victory of the weekend.</p>\n<p>As the rain slowly died down, UCSB took the pool against powerhouse No. 2 USC in the final game of the 2017 Winter Invitational. USC came into the game with an average margin of victory of over 11 goals in their previous four games at the Winter Invite.</p>\n<p>The Trojans continued their goal-scoring frenzy, pouring in seven goals in the first period of play. The Gauchos struggled to get anything together as they trailed 2-12 at the half.</p>\n<p>Snyder, Selin, Trabucco and senior attacker Brenna Thomas scored the Gauchos five goals in the game. USC never took its foot off the gas, winning 19-5 to give it an undefeated record for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Despite the tough loss to close out their host event, the Gauchos felt good about their performances throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with where we’re at,” Kay said. “I’m actually happy that the weather came in and was windy and stormy; I think it gave us something that we’re really not used to so I think it’ll make us stronger in the end.”</p>\n<p>Shore and Snyder led the team in goals with 11 each. The standout freshman Snyder was very productive over the weekend in her first action with the team.</p>\n<p>“She [Snyder] can play on the outside and on the inside,” Kay said. “She was scoring on power plays, on the perimeter and in front of the cage. She’s a scorer. She’s a finisher. She has no fear.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend, UCSB will make the trip to Tempe, Ariz., home of Arizona State, to take part in the Arizona State Invitational.</p><div

Ariz. to participate in the Arizona State Invitational against two top-25 nationally ranked teams for its first road test of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face No. 21 Wagner and the invite’s host in No. 5 Arizona State this weekend. Both opponents will be playing in season-opening matches, and the Gauchos can only hope their heavy slate to begin the year will be to their advantage despite a short time span for recovery.</p>\n<p>“I knew that six games in three days were a lot to ask for the team to compete at such a high level at the very beginning of the season. It was intended to be that way,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday will commence the Arizona State Invitational for UCSB when it faces Wagner. Notably, both programs have been on an upward trend in recent years.</p>\n<p>However, just like UCSB, Wagner lost some key players who contributed to all of its winnings in recent years. Three of their top five goal scorers in program history graduated last spring. That record-setting core of players led the team to three straight MAAC Tournament Championships.</p>\n<p>Even with the departure of several players, the Seahawks are still not as young as the Gauchos, who consist of eight freshmen and one transfer.</p>\n<p>“Fifty percent of our team is new, but it’s the beginning of the season,” Kay said. “The positive thing is that I think we will be competitive against anybody, so I’m excited about that.”</p>\n<p>Both teams are still trying to find the right mixture of players and play styles. However, UCSB has a slight edge with the momentum it gained from its four victories.</p>\n<p>Wagner is led by three juniors — attacker Elise Begg, utility Kimberly Watson and attacker Lacey Anderson — who all contributed over 55 goals a season ago, ranking them just behind the former three-headed scoring core of seniors who shattered various records.</p>\n<p>Wagner and UCSB have only faced off twice in the past; both meetings were in the last two years. The Gauchos won both games by the scores of 10-6 and 5-3.</p>\n<p>Sunday will provide a tougher matchup versus Arizona State. Scoring against the Sun Devils’ defense will be no easy task as the unit is led by star redshirt junior Mia Rycraw inside the goal cage.</p>\n<p>Rycraw finished last season as a Second-Team All-American goalie with 318 saves, which was first in the conference and third in Arizona State single-season history.</p>\n<p>She is joined by a terrific sophomore attacker from Assendelft, Netherlands, Maud Koopman. Koopman led the Sun Devils in points last season as a freshman with 35 goals.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils have been living in the shadows of MPSF powerhouses USC, Stanford, and UCLA, who routinely compete for National Championships. The current polls have Arizona State only behind Cal, UCLA, USC and Stanford, who are all in the MPSF conference.</p>\n<p>Arizona State finished the 2016 season with a 10-1 home record. UCSB was just 1-4 on the road last year.</p>\n<p>ASU has beaten UCSB once in each of the last five seasons by an average margin of victory of nearly four goals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will once again see where they’re at after the two games this weekend. For now, this team is still trying to figure some things out.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t played anybody else besides ourselves before [last] weekend,” Kay said. “Playing other teams really shows what we need to work on and also what we’re good at. I’m looking forward to getting back to work this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Wagner at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 28 and Arizona State at 1 p.m. the following day, Jan. 29.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/","id":4924,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4923,4922,4921],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast Wagner, Fall to Arizona State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its first road trip of the season, the UCSB women's water polo split its pair of matchup at the ASU Invitational.

The Gauchos matched their season high for goals in a quarter with six as they outscored the Seahawks 6-3 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Over a minute into the second quarter, senior utility Taylor Shore threw in her first goal of the day to bring the Gauchos within one. Watson responded by netting her hat trick to bring the lead back to two goals for Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then went on a 3-0 scoring run to take their first lead of the afternoon at 5-4. Redshirt freshman attacker Shannon Moran began the scoring run followed by goals from Shore and freshman utility Sarah Snyder who continued her tremendous goal scoring run.</p>\n<p>Snyder finished the game with four goals which adds to her team high total of 15 goals on the season. The freshman also contributed with two assists this game and is the only gaucho to score in every game up to this point.</p>\n<p>Wagner added two more goals to their total as they took the lead once again, but UCSB returned the favor with two goals scored by Snyder and freshman attacker Natalie Selin ending the half on top 7-6.</p>\n<p>“Wagner came out battling and I give them a lot of credit,” UCSB Head Coach Serela Kay said. “They never backed down the whole game.”</p>\n<p>It took over half of the third quarter to get the first goal of the half. After that Seahawks equalizer, the Gauchos finished the quarter off with two goals in quick succession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara extended their unanswered goal scoring streak to four when they scored the first two goals of the fourth quarter. At this point the Gauchos had a cushioned 11-7 advantage with just 5:35 to go.</p>\n<p>After conceding three straight goals, including two over the final 1:29, the Gauchos held on for what turned out to be a nail-biting victory in the end.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a little out of control on our defensive end and even offensively just taking care of the ball,” Kay said. “We found a way to win, we found a way to hold on.”</p>\n<p>Aside from some mistakes in this game, the defense was solid yet again just like it has been all year for the Gauchos. They have only allowed over eight goals in two games this season. If you exclude the blowout loss to USC, the Gauchos have only conceded about 6.7 goal per game.</p>\n<p>The freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who had nine saves versus Wagner, has been a big part of the defensive success.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder holds down the cage for us and she has a high game IQ,” Kay said. “She has not only a physical presence but also a presence vocally in the cage and I think that makes a big difference for us.”</p>\n<p>Next up were the hosts Arizona State who came into the meeting with a 2-0 record having won their first two games of the Invitational.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils began the scoring at the 5:02 mark in the first quarter. In the ensuing possession, Shore assisted Selin for her second goal of the weekend to even the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Two minutes into the second period, freshman utility Kate Coski chalked up her fourth score of the season. At 2-1 this turned out to be the first and only lead for the Gauchos in this one.</p>\n<p>The hosts levelled 15 seconds later and then took the lead with under two minutes remaining in the half.</p>\n<p>As the half was winding down, Trabucco equalized with her first of two goals in the game. The half came to an end all even at 3-3 in Tempe, Ariz.</p>\n<p>“I was happy about the way that we competed right from the start,” Kay said. “Anytime you you’re playing a team 1-1 in the first quarter and then 3-3 at half that says that you’re playing solid defense and both teams are battling.”</p>\n<p>ASU turned it on the third quarter with four goals while not conceding any at the other end of the pool. UCSB was even with Arizona State in every quarter except the third which ended up costing them the game.</p>\n<p>“We made some poor choices offensively that led to goals for them that set up their offense,” Kay said. “We’re young and the season is early so it’s important at this point that we learn from that third quarter. I think it’s important when things get a little out of our control that we learn to be resilient.”</p>\n<p>The final score was 8-4 as ASU finished off their undefeated weekend. Santa Barbara ended the invitational splitting their two games in Tempe.</p>\n<p>Kay was very pleased with what this young team was able to do on their first road trip against a couple of strong sides. However, with the youth comes some natural obstacles to get around.</p>\n<p>“We need to focus on the details,” Kay said. “We need to realize that it’s the little things that make big things happen.”</p>\n<p>After a short break, UCSB will continue their season at the Triton Invitational in San Diego on February 11<sup>th</sup>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75374\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75374\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/","id":4925,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4924,4923,4922],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
