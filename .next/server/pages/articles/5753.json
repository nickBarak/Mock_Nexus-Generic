Due to its lack of advertisement, this revolutionary and unapologetically unique show remains relatively obscure, and even more than a month after its release it is still deprived of the popular buzz it deserves. “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is based on a 2012 memoir by Deborah Feldman, “Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots.” It follows a 19-year-old girl named Esther Schapiro, otherwise known as Esty, played by star Shira Haas, a 24-year-old Israeli actress who is already famous in Israeli cinema and television but has found new international fame with this series. Esty, like Feldman, escapes her highly secluded and heavily regulated Hasidic Jewish community. More specifically, Esty belongs to the Satmar community in Brooklyn, New York, and she flees to Berlin, Germany to escape the strict and limited lifestyle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As revealed in the 21-minute documentary, “Making</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unorthodox,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also on Netflix</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Satmar community is originally from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Szatmárnémeti</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hungary, and was created by descendants of Holocaust survivors in New York post-WWII. Their native language is Yiddish, and because the creators wanted to get every detail right, some actors who didn’t speak Yiddish had to learn the language for the show. As all Hasidic Jewish sects, the Satmar community interprets the Torah literally and follows very traditional rules. Both men and women dress very modestly and marry young, but women are especially protected from the outside world. They do not have access to higher education, they are forbidden from showing their hair and their main purpose in life is to bear children. As Esty describes in the show, they must rebuild the six million Jewish lives lost in the Holocaust.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escaping the community is nearly impossible, and even after it’s accomplished, members hunt down the runaways and try to coerce them into returning. It is essential that no Jew loses their way, so after Esty flees Brooklyn, her husband Yakov Schapiro, otherwise known as Yanky, and his cousin Moishe Lefkovitch follow her. Her arrival in Germany marks the second half of her story, and the producers disclose that the first half of the limited series closely portrays Feldman’s life, but the second half is entirely made up. Esty arrives in Berlin and quickly finds a group of friends who are all students at a prestigious music conservatory, and she sets her heart on winning an almost-unobtainable scholarship to the school. Location in this series is very important because a young Jewish girl going to Germany seems nonsensical, but is it there that Esty can truly find herself, and it brings history into a full circle. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Haas described in “Making Unorthodox,” I agree that the show isn’t “a story about the existence of God or something like that. It’s more about the right to have your own voice.” “Unorthodox”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takes us into a fascinating and widely unknown community, and though it is scripted, it gives viewers a raw, never-before-seen insight into the private lives of Hasidic Jews. Esty was always told and always knew that she was different </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she even warned Yanky before their arranged marriage. I believe that she will always have a certain level of respect and love for her upbringing, but she knew she could not live like that forever. She knew that she had to shed her roots to gain freedom. The show is only four episodes long, and when I realized that I couldn’t press “next episode,” I threw a fit. It ends with Esty’s audition, and the outcome of her acceptance to the music school that is so crucial to her remaining in Germany is unknown. I wouldn’t say the final episode ends on a cliffhanger, but it did leave me yearning for more, and made me want to run away to Berlin for no reason at all. There is no confirmed season two yet, but Feldman does have a sequel to her book called “Exodus: A Memoir,” so we can only hope for more of Esty since this series’ length was greatly disappointing. As Feldman explained, the general public doesn’t know much about Hasidic Jews, but they do know “the essence of what’s happening, that’s what’s universally understood.” The essence is finding individual freedom, finding your own community and finding where you belong, even if it means sacrificing everything. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 4.5/5</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

These are stubborn facts recorded in articles and video footage. Yet Mr. Banuelos criticizes Democrats and the media establishment as the ones who “openly decr[ied] an entire segment of the American population,” as if his candidate had not done so all on his own.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then claims that Mr. Trump won in response to an intolerant ideology that “is quick to label political opponents rather than engage in meaningful dialogue.” He is right in that regard — except he points the finger at the wrong candidate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The author says that we should all agree that “legitimate acts of racism need to be called out and dealt with accordingly.” Perhaps he should start with all the Trump supporters who have verbally and physically assaulted women, Muslims and African-Americans after the election. Or he could start by acknowledging the support that his candidate has received from groups like the Ku Klux Klan, who are so enthusiastic about his victory that David Duke, a former grand wizard of that organization </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrDavidDuke/status/796249464826687488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boasted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But perhaps, Mr. Banuelos, you argue that grouping you together with the KKK is an inherently unfair characterization, and you would be right. After all, no group containing millions of Americans can be fairly painted with broad brushstrokes. Yet you seem so unhesitatingly willing to do the same for those who opposed Mr. Trump’s candidacy by labeling the large proportion of Americans who opposed Trump as merely “the left,” as if they were a monolithic political force devoid of the differing beliefs individuals can still have with their ideological peers. </span></p>\n<p>If we really are to unite together and put patriotism above partisanship, we ought to start by dispensing with the caricatures that have permeated our discourse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a conservative, the author’s embrace of Trump’s candidacy on the basis of conservatism puzzles me. I believe that America is safest when we embrace a policy of what Reagan called “peace through strength,” by establishing a strong and rigorous defense and standing resolutely with our allies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump believes that our partners in NATO are disposable, and that our support should be contingent upon how much they’ve paid us, as if we ought to play the role of the mafia demanding protection money. If Mr. Trump truly believed in “peace through strength,” he should know that NATO has helped </span><a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/nato/nato-can-remain-relevant/p28292\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preserve stability</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Europe for over half a century, and that our alliances are instrumental to our security, especially in this increasingly interconnected world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conservatism stems from the belief that the free market is the greatest economic engine in history, and when reasonably regulated, can create a rising tide that lifts all boats. Free trade facilitated Europe’s miraculous economic recovery after World War II and America’s stratospheric rise to the status of a global superpower. It has enabled those with lower incomes to have higher spending power by giving them access to cheaper products, and capitalism continues to be the economic force that lifts millions out of poverty in Africa and Asia.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Donald Trump represents the type of individual our Founders feared: a demagogue who appeals to our society’s worst impulses.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>This is not to say that freer trade has not come without its costs. Millions of American workers have lost manufacturing jobs because of foreign competition, and we should rightfully find ways to help them. But Donald Trump’s policies will not do that. Instead he believes he can bring jobs back to America by threatening to hike up tariffs with China and withdraw from NAFTA, stoking the very real possibility of a trade war that would</span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/19/the-effect-of-trumps-trade-policies-trade-wars-with-china-mexico-that-could-cost-u-s-4-million-jobs-report-says/\"><span> hurt</span></a><span> the very middle-class and working poor families he claims to champion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While conservatives believe in fiscal responsibility through lowering taxes and broadening the tax base, Trump instead proposes playing a game of fiscal acrobatics by favoring massive tax cuts and simultaneously promising to dramatically </span><a href=\"https://www.greatagain.gov/policy/transportation-infrastructure.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spending. His policies would recklessly </span><a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-fiscal-guide-2016-election\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">add</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $11.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade in a plan so incoherent it would make a volume of Tolstoy or Dostoevsky seem easily comprehensible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Banuelos ends by saying that, “Those who pretend their ‘existence’ is at risk by having a President Trump should remember he cannot do anything without the discretion of 535 members of Congress.” On this point, the author may well be right … If we discount the president’s power to veto legislation, negotiate treaties, deport illegal immigrants, detain suspected terrorists, order troops into combat, conduct drone strikes or launch nuclear warheads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The executive branch may be checked by the powers of the legislative and the judicial, but let’s not kid ourselves about how “little” the president can do. The office carries a great burden of responsibility, one that I do not believe Donald Trump is fit to carry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m ashamed of the decision our country has made on who should be president for the next four years. I believe that we have a special obligation to be responsible stewards of this country. Donald Trump represents the type of individual our Founders feared: a demagogue who appeals to our society’s worst impulses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet on January 20th, he will become the next president of the United States, and one can only hope, against the preponderance of evidence thus far, that he truly becomes a president for all Americans. He would do well to remember what Kennedy said in his inaugural: “Civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Calvin Chiu isn’t quite ready to

The prize was upped to $1 million dollars — the same amount offered to people starving on an island for 39 days (“Survivor”) and double that of being locked in a house for three months (“Big Brother”). Even half a million would be generous as a prize, but the whopping sum of cash is chalked up to the show’s obsession with finding “the next big global brand” and the prize that would jump-start their career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the prize wasn’t enough to prove Amazon is investing a lot of money into the show, the workrooms and locations for filming are insane. In the show’s premiere, we meet the designers as they gawk at the New York City skyline and settle in — just kidding! Time to fly to Paris, and then, halfway through the season, get bored of all the luxury and switch again to Tokyo. The designers’ first runway show takes place at night in front of the glowing Eiffel Tower. Other runway shows in the season are at the Musée Des Arts Décoratifs, on the banks of the River Seine, at an outdoor museum in Tokyo and at Amazon Fashion’s digital immersion experience, where looks are displayed with backgrounds projected behind them in an amazing display of futuristic technology.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1977838143\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94294\"><img data-attachment-id=\"94298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/heidi-klum-and-tim-gunns-making-the-cut-barely-makes-it-work/variety-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"681,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Variety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94298\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?resize=681%2C383\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?w=681&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Variety.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a joy to watch some of these fantastic runway presentations, and it certainly makes for great TV when the designers get choked up while premiering their work in front of the Eiffel Tower. It was so cool that I wanted to get into fashion design just to make it onto Season 2! However, all dramatic tension is lost when the contestants are corralled back into the workroom to hear the results of the episode. It’s a nice space, but why the contestants can’t have the excitement of a win on the actual runway, at these incredible locations, is still unknown to me. Can you imagine being eliminated, and then crying to inspirational music as you walk out of one of the coolest museums in France? That would be great to watch, even if your dreams </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crushed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of having six designers on stage at once for critiques, Klum and the judges (including blunt superstar Naomi Campbell, whose appearance probably triples the entirety of the show’s cost) talk to about four contestants individually, then make a decision about them. Citing that “a conversation can change everything,” Klum asks the judges the not-so-slogan-ready “Have any of you judges changed your mind?” which we hear every episode and is put to good use twice. The clunky phrase “Congratulations, you’re making the cut,” said to safe contestants, is nowhere near as cold and dramatic as “You’re in,” heard on “Project Runway.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fashion, one day you’re in, and the next day you are out,” Klum cautioned previously, but here, states, “In fashion, sometimes you’re making the cut, and other times you are not making the cut, unless some of the judges have changed their mind.” It’s a bit too awkward to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a good note, the contestants are an obvious plus in the show. Unlike “Runway,” these are skilled designers that have already established a brand for themselves, so their talents are unmatched. It’s an incredibly diverse cast as well, with contestants from Malaysia, Israel, Belgium and Italy, alongside the seven from the United States. In particular, Sander Bos’ insane creativity, Esther Perbandt’s stubbornness to deviate from her all-black wardrobe, and Martha Gottwald’s JoJo Siwa-inspired colorful clothing all caught my eye.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest changes the show sees is the introduction of invisible seamstresses that do most of the tedious work for the designers, who leave instructions on what to do. This is implemented due to the insistence that this is a design, not sewing, competition but the language barrier sometimes leaves the stressed contestants with unfinished garments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another noticeable change is the new segments of Klum and Gunn hanging around in whichever city they’re currently in, doing activities like virtual fighting, getting caricatures painted, shopping, learning words like “titillating” and trying to prove to the audience that they’re totally friends. “Look, everyone, we do get together outside of filming! We totally aren’t playing into the admiration fans have for this duo and using it to our advantage! We shop just like you!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you desperately miss Klum and Gunn and miss watching innovative fashions walk down the runway, this show does the job. Some of the challenges, particularly the ones in the “Opposing Forces” and “Pop Up Shop” episodes bring out the best in the designers — it’s always a pleasure to watch talented people do what they’re best at. For now, it’s “making the cut.” Fine, Heidi Klum, it sticks around after a while.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

Spoilers ahead.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be fooled by the title. While “Never Have I Ever” may sound like an otherwise banal and dry teen show from the name, the show presents so much more for the representation of women of color in television and a fresh realistic storyline for a culturally diverse audience. Each episode’s title is clever, as it starts with “Never Have I Ever” and ends in a hint as to what tumultuous conflict will come to fruition in the next episode. As a half-Indian viewer, I was intrigued to see how the show would represent Indian culture — particularly Indian stereotypes that have </span><a href=\"https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/198683\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pervaded media culture in the past</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Would this show extend beyond the nerd stereotypes that suffuse Indian culture? The answer is not simple, but one that is craftily developed by popular Indian-American creator Mindy Kaling, who based the show loosely on her own childhood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pilot season consists of 10 thirty-minute episodes, which turned out to be a good condition for a five-hour binge-fest on my sofa. The show is definitely geared toward younger audiences, as the characters are all in high school and the plot revolves largely around a teen romance between 15-year-old main character Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and jock Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet). While this seems like an otherwise familiar coming-of-age storyline, the show challenges the topic of lust based purely on attraction, something refreshing to see in a young-adult comedy. The conversation about Devi’s impending loss of virginity is thrown into disarray between Devi’s own inner-reluctance and constant surveillance from Devi’s mom (Poorna Jagannathan). While this comedic element consumes the plot, other dilemmas in the show confront grief in the loss of Devi’s father, her sudden paralysis and the comeback into her sophomore year with her two best friends Eleanor (Ramona Young) and Fabiola (Lee Rodriguez). </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramakrishnan’s breakout performance as Devi brings a unique spark to the show, as her wit, intelligence and humor are coupled with her endless deflection of the loss of her father, until she reaches an emotional break. Her sought-after vision is to live a normal teenage life, which is disrupted by the harsh parenting of her mother, which allows Indian viewers to relate to the strict but loving parenting style of Indian parents. However, Devi’s mother proves to be a multi-dimensional character as well, whose choices are understandable from her own emotional trauma. Devi’s life events are humorously and uniquely narrated by tennis legend John McEnroe, which might seem odd at first, but is later justified in the show’s storyline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other notable characters include Devi’s goody-two-shoes cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani), who is portrayed as the “beautiful” and “innocent” member of the family, a doctorate student at CalTech who is hesitantly preparing for an arranged marriage. While Devi is constantly sparring with her family, she soon realizes that her rejection of Indian cultural norms is something she shares with Kamala, more than she may initially realize. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her wealthy academic competitor Ben (Jaren Lewison) is originally depicted as an antagonist who will do anything to one-up Devi, but a character who sweetly turns out to be one of Devi’s greatest allies and who faces adolescent battles of his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devi’s best friends Eleanor and Fabiola rightfully get their own minor storylines, weaved in seamlessly to the challenges high schoolers face in regards to family and sexuality. These plot points sometimes clash with Devi’s own self-absorbed attitude, which contributes to major highs and lows in their collective friendship. In a way, the show serves as an enlightening awakening in each of the three friend’s lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to Indian culture, “Never Have I Ever” may have some eye-roll moments for Indian audiences, especially in the reference of Priyanka Chopra as the epitome of “Indian beauty” multiple times in the series. Similarly, the characterization of Devi as the stereotypical sexually undesirable geek is a bit tiresome to see in such a diverse show. However, the charming moments present in the series definitely outweigh the Indian-American references crafted to appeal to the Americanized gaze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Never Have I Ever” may westernize some elements of Indian culture but stands out in its portrayal of its main character: Devi adapts from an insecure high school teenager to a bold and risk-taking young adult. Devi’s ethnic background is an essential part of the show in how it shapes Devi’s shifting attitudes and uprise against omnipresent tradition. The show applies truthful elements of malicious behavior that stem from growing up and confronting our own inner demons, whether it’s an absent family in Ben’s case or the acceptance of loss in Devi’s. The series ends on an enlivening note in the neglect of fulfilling a perfect teenage fantasy in favor of growing to accept the reality of what makes us happy in our individual lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.
