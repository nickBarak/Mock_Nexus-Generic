The final score was 11-2, with the Mustangs taking home the championship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came here to play with some of the best people around and improve my game,” said Miguel Del Real, a second-year student at Cal Poly hailing from Santa Cruz. Del Real has been playing beer die since his sophomore year in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s my second year coming here, and you know, Santa Barbara’s kind of the place to be for this stuff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tournament, held at the Kappa Sigma fraternity sand pit, drew a large number of players and spectators. Its host, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dyeislife, was founded in 2015 by Tanner Guisness, a marketing major who studied at the University of Colorado Boulder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness said he began playing beer die in his sophomore year of college and discovered his passion for the game through his time in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduation, Guisness started an Instagram page </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> @dyeislife </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which grew rapidly as he went from college to college and currently boasts over 91 thousand followers. Now, Dyeislife is a business that he runs with his partner Jack Hagerty, a former SBCC student, that manages die beer die tournaments across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness primarily manages tournaments at East Coast colleges such as Penn State and Clemson University while Hagerty handles the majority of the northern California events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just spreading the gospel of die across the country,” Hagerty said. “We just want to teach the kids what’s good. I mean, look at this energy, it’s so electric.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My goal is to have every backyard set up with a die table,” Guisness added. “Sand, astro, turf? Doesn’t matter, man, I just want kids playing this game. A lot of people think it’s bad because people are drinking, but hey, better beer than chugging a whole handle by yourself, you know what I mean? At least here with die, there are rules and you have to space it out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gusiness and Hagerty also mentioned that Kappa Sigma was instrumental in getting the event off its feet; the fraternity inspected the sand pits to be free of glass and set up the tables up for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reactions to the event were also very positive, with many non-SB natives complimenting Santa Barbara’s locale, vibe and weather, Hagerty said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite playing the game for years, Gusiness still finds himself reminiscing about Santa Barbara: its weather, picturesque environment and — not to mention — the joys of spreading beer die spirit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one does it quite like Santa Barbara,” Gusiness said. “I mean, look around. Beautiful blue skies, tons of dudes, tons of beer and tons of die sports. It’s a beautiful thing.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/","id":4113,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[4112,4111,4110],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit","biography":"Not available","articles":[4113,5725,5735,6224,6262,6573,6588],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 8 Gauchos Look To Get Back On Track, Face CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2019-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AngieBanks_Baseball_Feb2019.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AngieBanks_Baseball_Feb2019.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos will hope to get back on track this week facing a CSUN team that ranks seventh in the conference in batting average.

In losses on Friday and Saturday, the Gauchos were outscored by a combined score of 16-6. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, starter Ben Brecht took his usual spot on the mound for the Gauchos. Coming into the game, Brecht had pitched stellar, but that night he was anything but.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brecht (7-1) suffered his first loss of the season following an outing that included allowing eight hits and seven earned runs in just four innings of work. The junior also had a season-low three strikeouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, the story was the same for Jack Dashwood (6-1). The lefty suffered his first loss of the season following a 4.2 inning outing that involved him allowing nine hits and five earned runs. Dashwood did strike out nine batters but gave up a season-high two home runs in the same game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will hope to get back on track this week facing a CSUN team that ranks seventh in the conference in batting average. The team sports just a .259 batting average. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when CSUN does get contact, it hits for power as its slugging percentage (.404) ranks third in the conference meaning Gaucho pitchers will need to make sure to not throw stuff right down the plate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, last week UCSB pitchers were facing one of the best power hitters in the Big West in Conner Cannon from UCR. This week, CSUN does not really have a ferocious hitter such as Cannon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matadors do have infielder Kyle Barret, however, and he certainly has had a solid campaign. He currently sports a .333 batting average and has drove in 25 runs. His 15 doubles on the season rank first in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN still has other solid hitters across the lineup as it has four players in the top 30 of the conference in terms of batting average, but no one that really scares the opposition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, however, definitely have those power hitters that scare the opposition. Even last week, UCSB still sprayed a bunch of hits, and in the one game the squad took at UCR, it exploded for 20 hits and 15 runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore shortstop McClain O’Connor was the man of the hour last Sunday at UCR as he had the game of his life batting 4 for 6 driving in four runs and scoring three times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O’Connor is really one of the hottest bats on the team since becoming a consistent player in the lineup mid-March. In his last 14 outings, O’Connor has accumulated 20 hits and eight RBI’s. His .359 batting average would rank as one of the top among the conference if he had more at-bats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of hot bats, outfielder Armani Smith has been on a tear. The junior currently holds a five-game hitting streak and in that same time span, Smith has gone 6-17 with three RBI’s. His 33 RBI’s rank third amongst the team while his eight home runs rank second.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Smith also hit the .300 club as he sports a .302 batting average thanks to his recent hitting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, Marcos Castanon made his return to the lineup last weekend and has been solid.

Fischer said this policy affects a few streets in Santa Barbara, some in Goleta and every street in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students like Joy, it was a shock to learn they would not be able to park their oversized vehicles in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be disappointing if they started enforcing [the ordinance] in I.V. to kick out students and others who literally can’t afford rent, and live in a van by necessity,” Joy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the College Affordability Town Hall on Oct. 11 students asked Supervisor Joan Hartmann how the ordinance would affect students who live in their vehicles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [aren’t] students but tend to be other homeless adults,” she replied, explaining that the situation in 2013 – before the passing of the ordinance – saw a number of oversized vehicles parked in I.V. that were not owned by students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the issue of housing insecurity is not limited to non-student adults </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2017, the UC Global Food Initiative found that 5% of UC undergraduate and graduate students experienced housing insecurity at some point in their enrollment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. Some students choose to opt out of paying high rent prices by living in vehicles like vans, RVs or busses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katelyn Wiese, a third-year Santa Barbara City College geology student, moved into a school bus earlier this year. She had been living in I.V. for several months, but since these signs have gone up, she said she no longer feels comfortable parking her bus in the neighborhood and now parks in different locations around Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I can’t be in I.V. It’s not even an option for me,” she told the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Sustainability Coordinator Katie Maynard, the UC system has launched a Rapid Rehousing program to address housing insecure and houseless students; UCSB now receives $415,000 a year to assist housing-insecure and houseless students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Financial Crisis Response Team can place eligible students who are currently houseless or about to become houseless in bridge housing within 24 to 48 hours, after which the team will work with the student to help them find stable housing moving forward,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the program can also provide “awards” to students to help if “they have difficulty paying rent and need financial support to stay in their current housing.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91253\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91253\" data-attachment-id=\"91253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0317\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91253\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=308%2C410\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Nadia Abushanab</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for some, the decision to move into a vehicle may not be motivated by finances. Both Wiese and Joy said that while their decisions to move into their vehicles were partially due to the financial benefit of not paying rent, they also said they wanted to experience more freedom, be able to travel more easily and learn to live more simply. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Santa Barbara municipal code, all oversized vehicles parked overnight are subject to a $50 minimum fine and possible removal. However, Alissa Hazard, a traffic engineer for the County of Santa Barbara, said that vehicles have previously only been cited when an I.V. resident files a complaint with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Wiese’s school bus is oversized, she has not yet been cited or towed as of mid-October. She has, however, had multiple negative interactions with I.V. residents, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[A resident] yelled at me a couple of times … he [said], ‘If you’re not out of here by sunset, I’m calling the cops on you!’ … He said that us van-dwellers make the neighborhood a shithole,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also had conflicts with the IVFP. “They would wake me up at 3, 4 a.m., banging on my door, shining lights in the windows, yelling at me to get out,” she recounted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fischer emphasized that the ordinance only restricts oversized vehicles </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as Wiese’s school bus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not regular-sized vehicles. She encourages those who are living in oversized vehicles to enroll in the Safe Parking Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cassie Roach, a UCSB alumnae now working for the Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara, the program is meant to not only provide immediate overnight safety, but also to connect houseless folks to other community resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We partner a lot with the food bank … we also have our own food bank once a month; we try and get people connected to free showers, making sure people are signed up for food stamps, have health insurance [and] are signed up for different subsidized-housing waiting lists,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach estimates that around 10% of their clients are students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wiese said that when she has been moved by police officers, they often referred her to the Safe Parking Program. However, she said the regulations of the program have stopped her from pursuing this option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not ideal for someone who has irregular schedules, who is either going to school or working. A lot of people who live in their vehicles are working and go to school. It’s not like they’re just sitting around all day,” Wiese said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach emphasized that the regulations of the Safe Parking Program are not meant to make people’s lives more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not meant to be this overbearing, strict program that’s going to have rules that they have to follow and just make life harder. It’s meant to be a supportive safe space for them, and we do want to work with all of our clients to see how we can best support them moving forward,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be a resource for students. We want to be supportive and helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:01 a.m.]: Joy uses they/them pronouns.
