More importantly, the loss leaves the Gauchos in eighth place in the conference and they now trail Pepperdine by one and a half games for the fifth seed in the playoffs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With only three games left in the regular season, the Gauchos are still battling for a higher seed in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>“If we can clinch a couple more wins, we can put ourselves in a great spot in playoffs,” senior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “Our goal is to play Long Beach State or UCLA in the playoffs; that’d be great.”</p>\n<p>Both teams entered the contest with identical records and matched up equally on paper, but the Lancers were the aggressors early in the match and proved to be the better team as the game wore on.</p>\n<p>Despite having a lower hitting percentage than the Gauchos in the first set, Cal Baptist did not commit costly errors and benefitted from its aggressive play.</p>\n<p>Down 4-0 in the beginning stages of the set, the Lancers found themselves losing late in the game until finally drawing even with the Gauchos at 17 all. From there on, the Lancers dominated the frame, scoring eight of the final nine points to steal the set.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist picked up where it left off from the first set and had an early advantage in the second game.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos mounted a comeback of their own and tied the frame at 18, despite trailing throughout. Just as in the previous set, Cal Baptist outlasted UCSB for a 26-24 win.</p>\n<p>The Lancer’s two Brazilian outside hitters, senior Levi Cabral and sophomore Guilherme Koepp combined for 24 kills as Cal Baptist won the third set 25-19 for the sweep.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist was extremely efficient on offense in its last two sets, hitting for an impressive .640 clip in the second set with 17 kills, followed by a .409 hitting percentage in the final set. The Gauchos did not help themselves either, committing 16 total errors in the game compared to just eight errors for the Lancers.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht had another big game for UCSB. Licht led all Gauchos in kills with 13, making it the sixth time in eight games he has lead the team in kills. Senior middle blocker Dylan Davis had a subpar night for his standards, hitting only .091 with five kills and two blocks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have no time to dwell on the loss of the winning streak as it must prepare to face the top-ranked team in the nation on Friday in BYU.</p>\n<p>The Cougars enter as the only team as hot as the Gauchos before their loss against Cal Baptist. Brigham Young is currently on an 11-game winning streak and serves as a measuring stick for the Gauchos as the playoffs approach.</p>\n<p>“We know we can beat any team in our league, we proved it throughout our season,” Evans said. “We’re just going to have to take it to the teams.”</p>\n<p>In the previous match between the two teams, the Gauchos took the Cougars to the brink of defeat but were outlasted by BYU in the fifth set.</p>\n<p>In that game, four different Gauchos had double digit kills including senior outside hitter Miles Evans who had a career-high 21 kills. However, BYU’s junior outside hitter Taylor Sander had 20 kills, four digs and three blocks, which proved to be the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of confidence coming into the next match,” Evans said. “We know we can beat them and we really want to [win] so we can have a good chance for a good seed.”</p>\n<p>Besides serving as a measuring stick, Friday’s game against BYU will be critical in terms of seeding. The Gauchos are still in the hunt for the fourth seed in the playoffs which will grant them home court advantage. Santa Barbara has a 10-4 record at home but has struggled on the road, defeating only three conference opponents away from home and making the remaining games that more important.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are starting to feel the late season grind with only three games left in the regular season. UCSB was dealt with a devastating blow during last week’s trip to Hawaii. Evans suffered a high ankle sprain while playing against Hawaii when he stepped on sophomore middle blocker Jake Staahl’s foot.</p>\n<p>Ruled out by doctor’s for four to six weeks, the injury came as a surprise to Evans who might have played his last game as Gaucho. Evans will attempt to come back in three weeks, which will be put him on track to play in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against BYU is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 4th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/","id":5335,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5334,5333,5332],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Win Seventh Straight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Besides getting to spend spring break in Honolulu, the No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team also got to benefit from taking two games from the University of Hawaii this weekend, winning 3-1 on Frida...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Besides getting to spend spring break in Honolulu, the No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team also got to benefit from taking two games from the University of Hawaii this weekend, winning 3-1 on Friday and 3-0 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>After beginning the season 5-11, the Gauchos have been on a tear since, winning seven straight games and nine of their last 10.

UCSB was able to outlast its opponent when senior outside hitter Miles Evans delivered the final kill for a 25-23 win to steal the first frame.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara displayed just how potent it can be on offense in the second set, hitting for a .440 clip en route to taking the set 25-21. Freshman setter Jonah Seif distributed the ball on-point in his first two sets and finished with 13 assists in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB seemed to be on the verge of completing its third consecutive sweep but Hawaii prevailed with excellent defense in third set and won 25-18. The comeback attempt fell short as the Gauchos closed out the match 25-22 in the fourth game to win 3-1</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to overcome a 10-6.5 difference in blocks thanks to the efficiency of Licht, Evans and senior middle blocker Dylan Davis. Combined, the trio accounted for 35 of UCSB’s 50 kills on the night.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now get ready for its final road game of the season against Cal Baptist on Wednesday before playing its last three regular season games at home.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50613\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50613\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/gauchos-win-seventh-straight/","id":5332,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5331,5330,5329],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downs USC For First Road Win of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MVolleyball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MVolleyball-Mark-Brocher.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a stretch of untimely errors and heartbreaking defeats, the UCSB men’s volleyball team finally prevailed on the road last night, defeating No. 9 USC 3-1 for its first road win of the season.

More importantly, the team moves one spot ahead in the standings to 11th overall. Meanwhile, the Trojans have now lost three straight and drop to 3-8 both overall and in MPSF play.</p>\n<p>Unlike in its previous three matches, UCSB began the first set of the game red hot, jumping out to a 9-3 advantage against the Trojans. Fueled by senior middle blocker Dylan Davis’ three kills and four blocks in the set, the Gauchos increased their lead further and won the first set convincingly, 25-16.</p>\n<p>“We really stuck to our scouting reports for SC,” Davis said. “We really limited our errors and forced SC to play our game.”</p>\n<p>USC rebounded in the second game, but the Gauchos were just as relentless in their attack. A nail-biting game from start to finish, each side traded points until UCSB gave itself breathing room for a slight 18-14 lead. With each team failing to distance themselves, it eventually took the Gauchos seven match point serves to gut out a gritty 30-28 win.</p>\n<p>USCB held the decisive edge on defense, tallying seven blocks compared to the Trojans’ one, giving the Gauchos enough of an advantage to pull through.</p>\n<p>“It was a battle because we were back and forth constantly,” Evans said. “What was the big turnaround for us is that we got a lot of blocks tonight. Our passing and defense is what really helped us win that match.”</p>\n<p>After dropping the third set 25-21, UCSB seemed to be still reeling from the loss and began the fourth set down 6-1. A resilient performance from the Gauchos narrowed the gap and ultimately allowed them to take the set for a 25-21 victory and their first conference win since Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>“We started out not the way we wanted to,” Evans said. “We were a little timid, but we came back and we got a couple aces and that was really big for us.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has another critical game approaching against No. 7 UCLA Wednesday, a team that has defeated the Gauchos twice in the season already.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Mark Brocher/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-downs-usc-for-first-road-win-of-season/","id":5333,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5332,5331,5330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Red Hot Gauchos Travel to Cal Baptist","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  Having already clinched a spot in the postseason, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team looks to build on its current seven-game winning streak tonight against No. 6 Cal Baptist.

UCSB has had difficulty on the road and entered last weekend’s series with a 2-8 mark away from home, but has now won four of its last five road games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal Baptist enters with an identical record to the Gauchos after defeating Pepperdine in its last conference game. However, the game will be nothing more than a friendly scrimmage for the Lancers, who are ineligible for the postseason this year.</p>\n<p>In the previous meeting between these two teams back in early February, the back-and-forth contest went the full five sets, with the Gauchos prevailing in a thrilling final game after being down earlier in the frame. It has been UCSB’s only five-set win this year.</p>\n<p>Three Gauchos had double-digit kills in that game including senior middle blocker Dylan Davis and sophomore opposite Matt Marsh, who both had a team-high 13 kills. Davis finished with an incredibly efficient .571 hitting percentage. Sophomore outside hitter Kevin Donohue also provided energy off the bench and contributed seven kills in the match.</p>\n<p>Despite winning the game, the Gauchos still had trouble defending the Lancer’s two Brazilians on the left side of the court. Sophomore outside hitter Guilherme Koepp had 21 kills in the game and hit for a .455 clip, second-best on the team. UCSB was more adept at containing the Lancers’ other Brazilian outside hitter, senior Levi Cabral, who had 16 kills but hit only .171.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara still has to account for Cabral on the service line, as he ranks third in the conference in service aces per set with 0.41, and his 4.14 kill average is fourth in the league overall.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB will rely on team captain Davis to provide offense and defense for the team. This season, Davis is second on the team in kills with 186, second in hitting percentage with a .467 clip and has totaled 133 blocks, the most of any Gaucho on the team.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/red-hot-gauchos-travel-to-cal-baptist/","id":5334,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5333,5332,5331],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
