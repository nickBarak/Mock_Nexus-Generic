Had you talked to me just two short weeks ago, I would have said that the only word that comes to mind when I hear “Coachella” is “overrated.” But alas, having attended my first Coachella this April, my sentiments for the festival have taken a tentative 180.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Previously, I maintained that Coachella was for aspiring insta-models and white people who think they aren’t. Rather, I thought it was for the basic. Having attended other festivals with varying reputations like Lightning in a Bottle, FYF and Outside Lands, I concluded ignorantly that Coachella was for squares and that the people who make up the crowd are comparatively less vibey, mindful, woke or delightful than the refined and intellectual crowds that LiB, FYF and OSL attract. I was pleasantly mistaken.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Put simply, Coachella is the mack-daddy of all festivals. It does it big. The sheer production quality alone is reason enough to attend. What Coachella does that other festivals fail to is flush tons of funds into every single minute detail of the festival. They really do have a commitment to the festival attendees, and it shows. It’s not just a sham intent on exploiting a large gathering of affluent people. Everything caters to the pure enjoyment of the attendees and there’s something exquisite at every turn.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My first and primary concern prior to attendance was the demographic that Coachella attracts. Fellow festival goers can make or break a festival experience, and I wrongfully assumed that Coachella would attract a crowd that goes to festivals for all the wrong reasons. I expected that Coachella would be filled with pretentious, self-absorbed Instagram models seeking to bleed the festival grounds dry of every insta-worthy background. And while there are ample apparent models and ~influencers~ prancing about the festival grounds, there is also an equal counterweight. There are happy people who simply want to have fun and listen to dank music.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I was blissfully confronted with a sea of smiling faces and good-natured people equally as eager to see their favorite artists perform. People were not rude, I wasn’t pushed or battered, and I met wonderful humans at every stage. Coachella, you win this one. Rather than the pompous crowd I expected, I came across creative and fun-loving people who share the same interests as me. There’s no denying that the festival doubles as a quasi fashion show. Attendees don their gayest apparel and strut around in all of the glittery garb they own. But this is only one element to the festival. I learned to embrace the fashion as part of the Coachella experience and to appreciate the artfully crafted outfits that people put together.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The demographic was mainly 20-somethings, but I was also taken aback by the number of plausible moms and dads in attendance. Turns out even old people like cutting-edge performances from prodigious artists.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Furthermore, Coachella offers some of the better people-watching scenarios I’ve encountered in my 21 years. It trumps that of the Orange County Fair and the Paris metro combined. It’s such a physically beautiful crowd, too. It’s actually strange seeing so many attractive people in one place. I’m pretty sure all the objectively good-looking people on the planet were at Coachella Weekend one.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another concern I had with Coachella prior to attending was the music itself. I feared that the hundreds of dollars I invested in my experience would be put to waste. At a glance, the lineup didn’t seriously excite me, and I feared I would be forced to watch performances from people who make up for in notoriety what they lack in talent. Yet again, I was proven wrong.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Within 10 minutes of my attendance at the festival, the internet-famous yodeling boy was on stage. I was both utterly shocked and not surprised at all.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Coachella has something for everyone. Unlike other festivals, it does not pinhole itself by branding itself as a genre-specific festival. The breadth of its annual lineups continue to become increasingly polar. They pair rock artists with racy hip-hop performers and put Vance Joy on the same stage as Cardi B. The only boundary that Coachella consistently enforces is that there will be A-list artists. Again, they do it big.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tyler, the Creator has a very niche fanbase. His paramount talent does not transcend the fact that he’s not everybody’s cup of tea. He’s abrasive and unpredictable and I felt that Coachella was just not his vibe. Coachella encapsulates all of the things Tyler isn’t: white kids doing drugs they bought with their parents’ money and wearing clothing made by designers whose names they can’t pronounce. Instagram photo shoots, recording of performances, trying to outdo everyone around you on the most superficial level. His performance didn’t garner the attention it deserved and the lack of energy in the crowd was noticeable. A word of advice? Stick to Flog Gnaw, Tyler.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Odesza delivered wizardry to my eyeballs. The American electronic duo employed unprecedented tactics to amaze and entertain the audience, and it worked. Hundreds of drones filled the sky with light in what looked like a continuation of floating paper lanterns up from the screen. These drones continued to beam and shift until they formed the duo’s symbol in the sky. I personally found it was quite rude of the artists to place such an impressive distraction in the middle of their set. I couldn’t focus on the performance because I was in a continuous state of utter awe. Their set was beautiful and ethereal. It made me cry, made me smile, made me drop it like it was hot and made me bang on my own set of pretend drums. For a DJ duo with an image that is far from badass, they delivered in the area of badass-ness.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It’s so much more than a competition of who can compile the most rhinestone-clad articles of clothing in one ensemble.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This year’s Coachella lineup was particularly EDM-heavy. This could be reflective of a broader trend toward a favoring of the synthetic sound. The electro lineup included DJs ranging from king of night bass AC Slater to the celestial Odesza and featured most everything in between. I broke my neck at Troyboi’s trap-heavy set and womped in the Do Lab to my heart’s content.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Do Lab is where I would like to live when I grow up. It’s the place where DJs are always firing and drunk girls somehow make their way on stage and shoot giant water blasters that they shouldn’t be legally permitted to operate. The Do Lab is where funk intersects groove, and it all happens under a billowy covering of magnificent colorful tarps. It’s always popping off, always there for you in your time of need.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, let’s talk headliners. The Weeknd headlined the first night of the festival. He performed banger after banger, and I appreciated that. He sang beautifully and exposed his talent in a nonchalant manner, opting for a more understated performance than his headlining counterparts. His performance was a great way to close the first day and kick off the festival.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Saturday, Beyoncé delivered a performance that was as earth-shattering as just about everything else she does. She served up what resembled more of a full-length concert than a festival performance. Throughout the entirety of the two hour performance all I could think about as I stared at her perfectly perky ass was that she popped three children out. Damn.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Her performance was filled with empowering nods to black culture and tasteful allusions to gender inequality. She elegantly and artfully made paramount social commentary all while strutting her shit and making it appear effortless in that true Beyoncé fashion. She closed her performance by humbly thanking the audience for allowing her to be the first black woman to headline Coachella, reminding us that she is somehow still a human.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For Coachella’s closing headliner, Eminem, I stood in the crowd by myself, barefoot, content, wiggling my toes in the grass and munching on a churro. But from Eminem, I wanted more. His performance got off to a peculiar start as red, white and blue fireworks shot into the sky and images of the American flag filled the jumbotrons. To these images he performed the song “White America,” and I found this to be a strange choice for the audience he was performing to. Out of all of his arsenal of hits to perform, and keeping in mind that headlining Coachella is one of the biggest performances of any artist’s career, I thought it a strange choice to include a song that mocks the very crowd of people he was performing to. From Eminem, I wanted more hits and less political commentary from a white dude.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Festivals aren’t solely about music, however. Coachella is also famous for its featured art and grandiose decor. This year the art did not disappoint. After two days of substance-clouded festival-ing I decided I was ready to experience Coachella in totality (or rather, sober). I actually had no choice as I had quickly reached my body’s breaking point.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My voice was nowhere to be found, the dirt underneath my fingernails became part of my ‘chella aesthetic and the blisters on my feet were so massive they deserved their own Instagram accounts. Not to mention my liver, brain, cardiovascular system and overall sense of reality were begging for sobriety.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I spent the remaining sober leg of my Coachella experience by myself, exploring the festival grounds, admiring the beautiful art and meeting fellow festival goers in passing. I stumbled upon a structure that I had passed a handful of times throughout the course of the weekend but never truly looked at. It was a striking, chrome, spaceship-looking piece titled “Lodestar” </span><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: small;\">— </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">and it was stunning. I walked around the structure for 45 minutes, admiring its form and delving into its intricacies. It was in that moment that it dawned on me: this is what Coachella is all about. Sure, it’s everything it appears to be at face value: the music, the clothes, the star-studded surprise performances and the cliche ferris wheel pictures. But it’s also this beautiful conglomeration of accidental and intentional hidden gems.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So, you can take this all with a grain of salt. Yes, all the surface assumptions about the festival do hold true. It is utilized as an excuse for people to show-off their finest festival attire and to potentially snap a selfie with a celeb. But Coachella is much more than the blog-o-sphere’s favorite festival. It is a gathering of artists, music and art lovers, fun seekers and colorful people who unite over a common love for the good stuff. It is overwhelmingly crowded, hot and loud, but it is also overwhelmingly merry, whimsical and spectacular.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The sheer grandeur of the festival is what makes it worthwhile and what keeps convincing 100,000+ people to attend every year.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Isla Vista, you now and again need a musical change of pace. The occasional backyard concert can often give you a solid alternative fix, but eventually, after one too many Red Hot Chili Peppers covers, you’ll probably need to hit the road for some refreshing higher quality tunes. If you were feeling this way last Wednesday, the game plan was then, of course, to head to SOhO and violently mosh to SadGirl and The Drums until physically impossible. I personally opted to choose this option last week, and, as the sea of drunken sweaty bodies around me could attest, it was a great call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums and other indie, surf-rock bands of the same nature have a general reputation for this kind of silly debauchery in the live setting. Last Wednesday was no different in SOhO’s smaller intimate space. The crowd looked like a typical Observatory OC or Burger Records type demographic, mainly LA-inspired college kids with a hint of hip older fans peppered in. My friends and I luckily cruised in just in time for a very pleasant surprise to start the night, the captivating and energetic performance from opener SadGirl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SadGirl’s set was refreshing and clean to a point where I felt rude and inferior in comparison to the rest of the crowd for not knowing who they were earlier. With a vibe very reminiscent of The Drums’ lo-fi aesthetic, they primed the stage perfectly for the rest of the night. Their simple, three-man lineup of guitar, drums and bass easily filled the room with indie sounds that did not fail to give the crowd a great time. This band shows a ton of potential to me be a landmark band in the indie scene, much like The Growlers, Twin Peaks and of course, The Drums are today. It was a pleasure to catch such a likeable and promising act early, especially given that I had previously known nothing about what was to come. A few moshes and subtle layers of sweat later, and the whole crowd and myself were ready for the chaotic follow up of The Drums.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums were, as the headline may allude, everything I expected and more. It was so simultaneously beautiful and hectic that it personally left me at a sensory crossroad that I haven’t felt in a long time, probably only comparable to Nine Inch Nails’ iconic comeback set at FYF 2017. The term “organized chaos,” although played out, immediately comes to mind when looking back, as the juxtaposition of the crazy violent moshing crowd and the elegant, crisp, and well rehearsed performance on stage weirdly enough worked perfectly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They came out to a classic track from their album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portamento,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “What You Were,” starting the set off strong and recognizing their long term, dedicated fans. As you have probably figured out by now, the audience was insane, pushing and moving and dancing like a bomb was just dropped on the crowd. I know this is being described excessively, but looking back, this excessiveness is extremely necessary — given how much god damn fun this show really was.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band’s stage presence was impeccable, as the beautiful light display provided a vibrant and encapsulating silhouette for lead singer Jonny Pierce’s elegant dancing around the microphone. The instrumentation was as clean as ever, with every cue followed perfectly and every transition executed excellently. This band is no stranger to the live setting, and even a between Coachella stop at SOhO was performed with the highest precision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums followed up their opener with familiar jams “Days” and “Money” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portamento</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and “Hart Basel” from their most recent 2017 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abysmal Thoughts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The set featured a good mix of old and new hits, all of which flowed seamlessly, considering the cohesive and consistent discography of the band. The set featured a wide array of The Drums’ discography, but generally favored their more recent work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band wrapped up with their newest single, and possibly biggest and most powerful track, “Blood Under My Belt,” before leaving the stage briefly before an encore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pierce’s crooning words “I still love you, I love you, I still do,” hit much harder in the live setting, providing a backdrop for one of the most gorgeous mosh pits I have ever personally witnessed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the crowd chanted excitedly for a return for one more song, the band came back out to end the night with another Drums’ classic “Down By the Water,” dating back all the way to their 2010 self-titled debut album. This last song choice seemed perfect in the moment, as a nod back to their roots in an intimate and a slowed down moment of meditation with their supporters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love indie rock, and I greatly appreciate The Drums and their influence in modern music, but I don’t often get to have live experiences quite like this one. Last Wednesday at SOhO was such a great change of pace — so gorgeous, so hectic, and so much fun. Nights like these show that not every concert experience has to be monumental or some life changing experience, but instead, can just be a really kickass time. The Drums gave downtown Santa Barbara a brilliantly wild escape from home, as I hope they continue to give people for many years to come. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/","id":6638,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6637,6636,6635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dillon Francis, Charli XCX, and More Tear it Up at Extravaganza ‘18","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In case you missed it, A.S.

Program Board (ASPB) presented the students of UCSB with their fun (and free) annual festival on the grass of Harder Stadium last weekend, featuring DJBJ,  Coast Modern, DRAM, Charli XCX and Dillon Francis. While, yes, many pessimists sought to degrade this line-up through Facebook comments and Twitter replies, there was no denying that every Gaucho in attendance was grateful for a temporary escape from the usual hangover-filled and homework-stuffed Sunday routine. In addition to this exciting cast of musicians set to play Extravaganza, several student vendors outlined the edges of the stadium and plenty of Instagram-worthy photo ops were available with the venue’s artsy tents, aesthetic signs and inflatable festival monster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening up Extravaganza this year was recent Battle of the DJs winner, DJBJ. This duo, wearing matching red, white and blue jerseys, brought forth an exciting, naive energy to the stage as they stood side by side spinning tracks together. However, even though everything seemed to be all “good vibes” and whatnot, DJBJ did have the difficult task of engaging a small audience since they began performing shortly after the gates opened, before many of the people showed up to Extravaganza. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to appeal to every music taste out there, DJBJ played a variety of hits from different genres in this amateur performance of theirs, displaying a breadth in music knowledge and appreciation. During their set, DJBJ remixed new songs like “Wild Thoughts” by Rihanna and “Nice For What” by Drake, then switched it up and played older artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Timberlake and Estelle. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following DJBJ was another musical duo, this time of the indie sort: Coast Modern. Originally formed in Los Angeles a few years ago by Luke Atlas and Coleman Trapp, Coast Modern has since grown into an established pop-rock band that has toured with popular artists like BØRNS, The Wombats and The Temper Trap. In between songs during their Extravaganza set, Atlas and Trapp frequently engaged with the audience, getting the crowd to sing and clap along with them and even referenced UCSB as the “University of Cool Skateboards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though their most recent album came out in 2017, Coast Modern has been releasing singles since 2015, like “Animals,” which many students in the crowd seemed to know and like. It was this track in particular that stood out the most as it provided a mellow, flowing beat with easy lyrics that anyone could sing along to. In a world of auto-tune and electronica, it was rather refreshing to see a live band perform as Coast Modern did, with even more authenticity and pizazz than audibly present in their studio recorded tracks. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83299\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1386099079\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83296\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83299\" data-attachment-id=\"83299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/dillon-francis-charli-xcx-and-more-tear-it-up-at-extravaganza-18/extrav-by-siavash-ghadiri-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Extrav by Siavash Ghadiri ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83299\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known largely for his hit “Broccoli” featuring Lil Yachty, DRAM performed after Coast Modern, switching up the theme from calm indie to exciting hip hop. Before DRAM (aka Does Real Ass Music) came out on stage, his DJ tested out the waters first, making sure us Gauchos were hyped enough for the rapper to begin his set. As he began singing, it was apparent the attendance rate at Extravaganza had exponentially grown since the gates’ opening at 1 p.m. (as did the number of drunk students asking to be lifted out of the pit by surrounding security guards). Prefacing his song “Cute,” DRAM explained to us that we should be striving to spread love every day and tell those we like that we “think they’re cute,” as he often says in his song. Overall, the energy DRAM brought to the stage kept everyone’s mood afloat and invited more students to let go and actively engage with his music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up was the woman who stole the show, popstar Charli XCX. Regardless of Dillon Francis being the headliner for Extravaganza, Charli fans made their way to the front of the stage for her set at 4:20 and made it clear that she was the most anticipated act. Making her way into the music scene with features in hits like “I Love It” by Icona Pop and “Fancy” by Iggy Azalea, Charli XCX has worked tirelessly to make a name for herself by releasing solo albums such as her most recent </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pop 2,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which came out in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting her set with “Boom Clap,” Charli jumped out from backstage wearing an all white, loose-fitting outfit that allowed her to dance any which way she chose. The combination of her charismatic stage presence and the familiarity of the song worked as an invitation for students to dance along with her, as she often tried to hype everyone up with phrases like, “UCSB, fuck it up!” and “When the beat drops, I want you guys to go crazy!” During her set, wigs were thrown to the stage, Charli abandoned her platform to sing directly with fans in the crowd and a giant beach ball travelled over the tops of everyone’s heads.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83301\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

well-known artist and producer, Dillon Francis. Though 15 minutes late to his scheduled set time, Francis presented students with loud, electronic music and very stimulating visuals that transformed the event from festival to rave. Hidden behind a giant screen which housed all of Francis’ DJing equipment, the crowd was able to directly interact with the music rather than focusing on the artist himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it was quite cool to have a DJ as successful as Francis performing on our campus, his set didn’t sound too far removed from what you might hear at a decent party on DP. The music was loud and techno-heavy, and it had a beat that every lit UCSB student could comfortably dance to in the realm of Harder Stadium. So in that sense, his set was a success. In any event, after two and a half quarters of hard work, ASPB pulled through and gave Gauchos a safe environment to let loose, enjoy some good live music and even get free reusable water bottles. ‘Til next time, Extravaganza! </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

the UCen to Storke Plaza, a smorgasbord of UCSB students flaunting colorful hair and wearing in mom jeans or pastel colored shoes munched on bags of Hot Cheetos under the sun as they anticipated the entrance of Claire Cottrill.</p>\n<p>Cottrill, better known by her stage name, Clairo, first entered the music scene back in 2015 when her music video for “Pretty Girl” — featuring the artist goofily dancing to her song and lip-syncing in front a webcam — went viral. In the span of less than a year, Clairo has risen to prominence among similar bedroom pop artists such as Bane’s World, Jakob Ogawa, No Vacation and Gus Dapperton.</p>\n<p>Nineteen-year-old Cottrill has been dreaming to break into music since she was 13, writing and posting music onto Bandcamp and SoundCloud. Now, entering her first year at Syracuse University, she is currently managed by the same manager Chance the Rapper had when he began his rise to stardom.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Recently, Clairo had her first big performance at Tyler, the Creator’s sold-out show at the Observatory for over 6,000 people. She performed alongside acts like Steve Lacy, Brockhampton, Michael Seyer and Inner Wave. Last Thursday, UCSB was lucky enough to be graced by Clairo’s first live performance with a band at A.S. Program Board’s Noon Storke Show.</p>\n<p>The crowd anxiously awaited the emerging pop star, who is expected to drop a six-song EP featuring Dublin rapper Rejjie Snow later this year. Humorously, Program Board gave out free bags of Flaming Hot Cheetos (in reference to her popular single of the same name), along with Yerba Mate.</p>\n<p>The eagerness to see Clairo garnered a crowd that not only filled the stairs but also hugged the walls overlooking Storke Plaza. Kids from an elementary school touring UCSB got to witness this gathering of students and entertained the collegiate group by dancing to the songs that filled the empty sound space before the show.</p>\n<p>Clairo came out from the KCSB courtyard skipping and sporting a casual UCSB shirt, and she warmly greeted the crowd. Immediately the students clapped and cheered in excitement as Clairo and her new band filled in blanks of the stage framed by the palm trees. They played classic songs such as “Pretty Girl” and “Flaming Hot Cheetos,” newer songs such as “4EVER,” an unreleased track and a cover of “Nakamarra” by Hiatus Kaiyote.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83086\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"161428297\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83084\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83086\" data-attachment-id=\"83086\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/flaminhotyerba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"flaminhotyerba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83086\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flaminhotyerba.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83086\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kelly He / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>With a live band, her sound was very different from her recorded tracks –– but in a good way. Ditching the lo-fi, synth-pop sound, Clairo took on a more indie-alternative take on her songs, substituting manufactured electronic beats with echoing, raw guitar licks, rumbling electric bass lines and shrill strikes of cymbals.</p>\n<p>For songs like “4EVER” and “Pretty Girl,” the band looped a backtrack of the iconic melodies but decorated it with jazzy additions played on their instruments. “Flaming Hot Cheetos” pleasantly surprised us with a funky breakdown at the end of the song, leaving the crowd smiling as Clairo bopped along while eating a bag of Hot Cheetos someone kindly threw to her before the song began.</p>\n<p>The charming, happy vibe of Clairo’s dreamy voice that floated above smooth guitar, bass and drums was the perfect sound to fill the air on a beautiful sunny day at UCSB.</p>\n<p>When the set was beginning to wrap up, the crowd demanded more. It was a relatively quick set, consisting of no more than ten songs. The crowd was prepared, however, and immediately began suggesting other songs they wanted her to perform when she apologized for the short set.</p>\n<p>Clairo was apparently flustered by the high demand of an encore, as she replied to her yelling fans, “Why are you yelling at me?”</p>\n<p>This moment also made it onto the Overheard at UCSB Facebook page and was quote tweeted by Clairo herself.</p>\n<p>For Clairo’s much anticipated encore, the band did another performance of “4EVER.” This time, initiated by a student sitting near the stage, people were encouraged to leave the stairs and dance at the front. The concert turned into a dance party reminiscent of teenagers just letting loose and having fun, twirling and grooving away their cares to the upbeat pop tune.</p>\n<p>After the dance party ended, people rushed to line up for the opportunity to meet her and take photos. Many students brought gifts; one handed her a bracelet and another a drawing. Students who came less prepared scrambled to find things for her to autograph. She was presented a range of items to sign: shoes, empty Hot Cheeto bags, skateboards, laptops and even an inhaler.</p>\n<p>Clairo’s luminescent presence left UCSB students glowing and wishing to “feel this way forever.” Make sure to look out for her EP –– although it has no official release date, it’s expected to be released soon. We’re looking forward to seeing how this bedroom pop sensation continues to shift out of her lo-fi sound in her upcoming EP.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/clairo-illuminates-storke-plaza/","id":6640,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6639,6638,6637],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
