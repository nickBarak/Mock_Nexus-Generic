CSD) meeting in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Tuesday’s meeting, I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt expressed the board’s sentiments that Deltopia in its current state, a fundamentally disorganized event that draws thousands of out-of-towners, creates a public safety concern for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQrErSI9EG7M_swcZiaWwgXZE0SA\">Deltopia 2019</a> saw 94 citations, 38 arrests, 19 medical transports and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/police-arrest-two-deltopia-visitors-on-armed-robbery-charges/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595548000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHa24jfKBR84l_Epw29OokNZ08eXw\">one serial robbery</a> — causing the month of April to have the highest number of arrests in comparison to previous months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Deltopia, as it exists, is not a safe environment. We see a spike in physical assaults, in sexual assaults. We see a spike in medical transports as a result of alcohol and drugs,” Brandt said at the meeting on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our board’s thought has always been to provide people with a fun alternative where the community has the ability to plan the event, plan the content of the event and have a better handle on what the security presence looks like that we can change the overall feel to be a much safer event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Proposal-V2-Includes-Budget-Site-Map-Security-Plan-IV-April-Event-2020-4.pdf\">current proposal</a> has the festival centered in the I.V. Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden featuring local breweries. The plan also includes detailed information regarding local community collaboration, security and the budget for the overall project, with expenses totalling $184,850.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire board unanimously expressed concern over the price tag of the event. According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD, there are two main options to cover the cost of the event in the budget: a UCSB grant, or the $100,000 reserve allocation currently in the budget. UCSB can grant $93,000 under one condition — the university must reach an agreement with the I.V. CSD as to what the expenses are for. However, Director George Thurlow expressed doubts as to whether UCSB would be willing to fund a community festival versus placing the money directly into public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ways to cover the cost of the festival could include sponsorships from local businesses and funding from the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD). Carlos Lopez, chairperson for the IVRPD, attended the meeting and said the IVRPD Board of Directors is willing to negotiate partially funding the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lopez also suggested a system of pre-registration for the festival where people could sign up online for a QR code that would grant them access to the event. A safety agreement and confirmation of residence in I.V. would accompany the QR code to deter outsiders from attending the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, possible sources of revenue could also come from local sponsorships and the beer garden. Tickets could be sold for the beer garden, in the style of a beer tasting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will also be foregoing the addition of food trucks to the festival — something they predicted would cause pushback from local businesses and go against their vision of a community-controlled event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvel emphasized the Safety, Security and Harm Reduction Plan of the proposal to better respond to the annual problems Deltopia brings. It includes the Guardian Team, a security service “with focus on de-escalation, harm reduction, and crisis management,” <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardianteam.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1c8D18DVtMBpd6p5IRgQgFRpfKw\">according to its website</a>, as well as a large medical team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we really pride ourselves on at Lucidity is we have a very, very well-staffed medical team on site. If anybody has any immediate emergency, we have the ability to support them right there and then,” Marvel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a proposal to end the event around 4 p.m. to funnel people toward UCSB’s campus event, The Warm Up, which typically begins at 6 p.m., Alan Avila, co-founder and head of security at Lucidity, said he is willing to negotiate to make the security and medical teams available until 10 p.m. or midnight should a situation arise where they are needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the festival’s budget still remains the primary concern for the directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have any of you electeds gone out in the community and said, ‘This is going to cost 180k of your utility user [tax], [and] you’re paying [for] it?’” Thurlow asked the board members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand echoed Thurlow’s thoughts and voiced his own concerns regarding the I.V. CSD’s ability to tackle the project as a newly formed entity and suggested approaching UCSB’s Associated Students for greater collaboration with the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am still a little bit concerned about the potential for this being a much bigger event during an already unsanctioned event,” Bertrand said. “I am definitely in support of scaling this down in any way that we can and aspiring to, in the next few years, put on this full event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the next I.V. CSD meeting will have a more in-depth revision of the budget, as well as possible updates from negotiations with other organizations. With the festival plans requiring months of preparation, Abboud says the board will have to make a decision soon over whether or not to actually hold the festival, possibly by the last I.V. CSD meeting of October or the first meeting of November.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

California: Long Beach, Mission Viejo, Huntington Beach and now, I.V.</p>\n<p>“[Rockfire Grill is] a fun and safe place for kids to unwind, try some different food that they normally don’t get in the I.V. area and just be in a space to be engaged with the community,” Jai Syal, Rockfire director of marketing and strategy, said.</p>\n<p>“Our burgers come on a fresh-baked flatbread bun, and that bun is baked in the oven after you order it.

Well, the UC Santa Barbara Surf Team is bringing both with their Stoked N’ Broke benefit concert on Oct. 20. Grab a friend or five and head on down to 6559 Segovia Road from noon until 5 p.m. for live music from I.V.’s best local bands, as well as a closing set by guests from San Luis Obispo. For just a $5 entrance fee, you will be automatically entered into a raffle to win prizes such as a surfboard, surf lessons and a private photo shoot, among other rad prizes you don’t want to miss. So don’t sleep on the center of UCSB’s stoke and help keep I.V.’s resident shredders in the water and competing statewide. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Carbs Against Carbon</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love pizza? Hate contributing to a massive carbon footprint? What a coincidence, so does UCSB’s Excursion Club! Isla Vista’s resident outdoor enthusiasts will be hosting a fundraiser at Woodstock’s on Oct. 24 from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m. to support the Carbon Fund, a nonprofit leading the fight against climate change. Excursion Club is encouraging all clubs on campus to go carbon-free, and what better way to get that mission across than with pizza?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Beautiful Bodies Clothing Swap</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In honor of Love Your Body Week, the Isla Vista Trading Post (IVTP) will be teaming up with the Women’s Center for another one of their famous clothing swaps. Taking place in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room on Oct. 23 from 5:30 to 8 p.m., the event encourages folks of all shapes, sizes and identities to come out and learn all about sustainable clothing practices, as well as how clothing can reflect body positivity. Abiding by the IVTP’s golden rule of “three for free,” attendees will be able to walk away with three free items of clothing. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Have A Laugh!</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embarcadero Hall will be transformed from dowdy lecture hall to hip and happenin’ comedy club on Saturday night, thanks to Laughology, UCSB’s premiere standup comedy group. Highlighting the show will be Trevor Wallace, who is best known for his “ain’t no laws when you’re drinking Claws” viral video in support of White Claws (which earned him a cease and desist order from the hard seltzer connoisseurs). The show, which will take place from 8 to 11, is free! </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-18/","id":4244,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4243,4242,4241],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
