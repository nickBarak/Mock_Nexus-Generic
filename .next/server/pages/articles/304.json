The two teams traded buckets until 9:39 when 49er freshman guard Loren Jackson made the three-pointer that started the Long Beach lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the half went on, the scoring slowed down as both teams struggled to find a solid squad on the court, moving many players on and off the bench. The last 1:12 of the first half solidified Long Beach’s lead as they increased their score by six points, four of which being completed foul shots by junior forward Roschon Prince. UCSB junior guard Tide Osifeso managed to land a three-pointer with two seconds left, finishing off the first half being 37-47.</span></p>\n<p>The 49ers had kept a small but steady lead during the latter part of the half but where they managed to outplay the Gauchos was in the details of the game. Although the two were tied in team rebounds, the Long Beach players managed to use more assists, make more blocks, and collectively have three less turnovers than UCSB, resulting in their 10-point lead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ending the first half, the top three scorers in the game all belonged to LBSU. Yussuf lead the board with 12 points, followed closely by junior guard Evan Payne with 10, and sophomore guard Noah Blackwell with eight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going into the second half, the Gauchos certainly had their work cut out for them. UCSB came into the period looking strong, scoring six points in under a minute at 16:52, but the 49ers were not about to let the score get too close, working back up to a nine-point lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the 15th minute to 11:45 left in the game, only two baskets were made: a free throw from UCSB junior forward Alex Hart and a three-pointer from Osifeso. This period of time was otherwise characterized by numerous missed shots on both sides of the court as well as a couple fouls from either team as the players began to fatigue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scoring became significantly less frequent in the last 10 minutes of the game. While Yussuf and a handful of other 49ers traded off scoring, senior guard Eric Childress single-handedly powered through for the Gauchos. Childress scored 11 points, nine of which were uninterrupted by any of his teammates, as the clock ran down. </span></p>\n<p>At 3:45 the Gauchos caught up to the 49ers off a layup from Childress, putting the score at 70-70. Unfortunately, UCSB did not have quite enough steam to take a lead despite the valiant efforts of Hart, who grabbed four boards and made two jump-shots in the last few moments.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it was not reflected in the final score, the Gauchos managed to outscore the 49ers in the second half 39 points to 34. Both teams worked hard and by the end of the game had totaled a similar number of rebounds, assists, and turnovers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losing only by five points, it was a close and well-fought match-up, but the 49ers consistently made more baskets making 46.4 percent of their shots while the Gauchos were only successful on 39.3 percent of theirs taken. </span></p>\n<p>Although LBSU would have been a definite step forward, the Gauchos have a chance to redeem themselves Saturday night when they play UC Riverside who is 4-11 overall despite their two-game winning streak.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/","id":304,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[303,302,301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander","biography":"Not available","articles":[248,281,283,301,304,307,310,467,470,472,493,514,1919,3330],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Looking to Pick Up Second Big West Win at LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After finally halting their three-game losing streak, the Gauchos will look to keep the ball rolling when they head to Long Beach to face the struggling 49ers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74872\" style=\"width: 532px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74872\" data-attachment-id=\"74872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/christian-terrell-dribbles-around-a-defender-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christian Terrell dribbles around a defender.

Having lost four of its last five games, LBSU will definitely be hungry to defend its home court in this match-up where it is a solid 6-1.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year the 49ers beat the Gauchos at home and away, both games high scoring with final results in the 70s. Those two victories turned out to be very beneficial for the 49ers, who finished the 2015-16 Big West conference in third place in the conference standings, going 12-4 Big West, while the Gauchos came in just behind them in fourth with an 11-5 Big West record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although neither team has been particularly strong this year, there is still plenty of conference play left. Overall, Long Beach has been solid on offense, averaging 73.8 points per game, which is the third-best mark in the conference, while also holding down the best free-throw percentage as a team with a 73.5 mark. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its four conference games this season, Long Beach State has scored an average of 81.5 points per game, a Big West high. However, its defense has been its Achilles heel; it has allowed the most points per game (87.2) while also giving up an astonishingly high three-point percentage at (41.2), both conference worsts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard Justin Bibbins currently leads the 49ers in minutes played, averaging 31.6 per game, as well as in assists with 82 so far in the season. Last year he earned second team all-Big West honors as he played in all 33 games as the Long Beach main point guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Bibbins’ fellow starters, junior guard Evan Payne, has averaged 14.7 points per game in the season and now 15.5 per game in conference. With junior forwards Gabe Levin and Roschon Prince grabbing 99 and 109 rebounds respectively, the starting lineup for Long Beach will present a challenge for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last game against Cal Poly, junior forward Alex Hart stepped up to lead the Gauchos to victory, scoring 15 points and grabbing 11 boards in his 36 minutes of playing time. With junior forwards Jalen Canty and Ami Lakoju unable to play, it is up to Hart and sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak to rise to the challenge of being UCSB’s “bigs” under the basket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman guard Clifton Powell Jr. has been electric on the court. Having started two out of the Gauchos’ three conference games so far, he has a conference field goal percentage of 45.1, proving to be a real asset when the pressure is on. This came to fruition again in Saturday’s win as Powell knocked down two big three balls — the only threes by the Gauchos that night — proving to be the difference in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from up and coming younger players, junior guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Eric Childress are still holding down the fort as reliable and seasoned veterans despite their combined score of 12 points in their most recent game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the 49ers and the Gauchos have experienced a rough season so far, but as the conference has only begun, both teams are eager to gain better footing through another win tomorrow night. With talented players to watch on both sides of the court, the Long Beach-UCSB match up will not be one to miss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB and LBSU tip-off is at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 19 in the Walter Pyramid Arena. The game will also be televised on Fox Sports West.</span><br>\nA version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/","id":301,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[300,299,298],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns Blowout Victory in Exhibition vs. CSULA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was clear sailing for the UCSB women's basketball team in its 90-53 exhibition victory over Cal State Los Angeles on Sunday.

You know who is on the court with you and how to get them the ball.”</p>\n<p>With a focus this offseason to improve the team’s pace of play, the Gauchos’ work was evident as they played to an up-tempo beat.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara capitalized on defense, stifling the Golden Eagles’ offense in points off turnovers 23-3. CSULA shot 32.8 percent on a 19-58 shooting effort and 25 percent from behind the three, going 5-20 from deep.</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to establish its quicker play on the offensive end, embarking on a 7-0 run in the game’s opening minutes. Making her presence felt and appearing in her first game as a Gaucho after transferring from USC was redshirt junior Drew Edelman.</p>\n<p>Listed as a forward on the team’s roster, Edelman started at the center position instead and had success in the paint. She scored six of the Gauchos’ first nine points en route to ending the game with a double-double of 10 points and a tied game-high total of 10 rebounds in 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ scoring stretch in the game’s early minutes led to a Golden Eagles timeout. CSULA benefited from the quick break, going on a 7-2 run of its own to trim UCSB’s lead to 9-7.</p>\n<p>Igniting the Golden Eagles’ scoring charge was a three-point make by sophomore guard Christine Delapina. Bringing the team within two points was a layup by freshman guard Da’Jah Jackson, who led CSULA in scoring, rebounding and steals with 12 points, five rebounds and two steals.</p>\n<p>Despite coming near, the Golden Eagles were unable to ever tie or take the lead as UCSB registered its best shooting quarter of the night in the first. It shot 11-16 from the field for a 68.8 percentage and 3-6 from long distance.</p>\n<p>The efficient shooting occurred during the Gauchos’ 20-4 run to close out the first period. Setting the stage for UCSB’s scoring outburst was sophomore guard Coco Miller. Able to halt CSULA’s surge with a three-pointer to give UCSB a 12-7 lead, Miller’s make from deep was the start to the Gauchos’ rout.</p>\n<p>Miller concluded the night 5-10, 3-8 from deep for 14 points alongside five rebounds and two steals.</p>\n<p>With 10 players getting at least five minutes of play in Sunday night’s game, the Gauchos’ depth was on full display. Although its shooting stroke seemed nearly flawless, UCSB’s high-scoring performance resulted from its initial plan to attack the paint.</p>\n<p>“We started the game by throwing it to Drew,” said Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. “You have to be good around the rim because then it forces ‘are you gonna guard the rim or are you gonna give us threes?’ That stretches the defense, but if you can’t be good around the rim, you’ll stretch it then can’t do anything. [For] every really good team, if you’re good right there you have a chance, especially if you put three-point shooters around the outside.”</p>\n<p>Achieving the drive and kick game plan was no issue for UCSB as it consistently penetrated the paint, sucking in the Golden Eagles’ defense, then converted with three-point makes.</p>\n<p>Unafraid to shoot the ball when given the chance was the team’s leading scorer Porter. She went 5-11 from behind the three-point line; just two of her total seven field goals were inside the line to cap off a near double-double with eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>Either driving to the paint for layups or to dish the ball to the perimeter were Toler and senior guard Onome Jemerigbe. Along with Toler’s assists, Jemerigbe chipped in six dimes of her own to go with just one turnover. UCSB doubled the Golden Eagles’ amount of assists 20-9.</p>\n<p>Also helping the Gauchos spread the floor and get the ball to their shooters was their advantage in rebounds. They outrebounded CSULA 54-33. Tying with Edelman for the lead in rebounds was junior small forward Taylor Farris with 10.</p>\n<p>Although Sunday’s game was only an exhibition, it was an encouraging performance for UCSB heading into its season opener this Friday. It reached the 90-point mark just once last season in a 93-78 win over Morehead State and was one point shy against La Verne.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its 2016-17 campaign on the road at Iowa State this Friday, Nov. 11 at 10 a.m. PST at the Hilton Coliseum.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73947\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73947\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/73947/","id":302,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[301,300,299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Face Mavericks Season Home Opener on Sat.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBasketball-161106-DustinHarris-01.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBasketball-161106-DustinHarris-01.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For the second consecutive season, the UCSB men's basketball team will face the University of Nebraska-Omaha in its season opening game.

It finished the season on a nine-game winning streak before ultimately falling to Hawaii in the conference tournament, ending its hopes of making the NCAA tournament and, effectively, ending its season.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks are also coming off a solid season in which they went 18-14 overall and 10-6 in its conference, the Summit League. Like the Gauchos, the Mavericks are projected to finish fourth in their conference.</p>\n<p>When these two teams met one season ago, Santa Barbara spoiled Nebraska-Omaha’s season and home opener, winning the match 60-59; revenge will probably be on the mind of the away team.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Gabe Vincent played a huge role in that one-point victory, scoring 16 points in 27 minutes. Despite the team-high five turnovers, Vincent was efficient with 5-16 shooting, three rebounds, two assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>In the exhibition match against the Sunbirds, the California native looked poised for another great season, scoring 11 points and knocking down three shots from three-point range. Vincent is coming off 80 three-pointers made a season ago, the second most in program history.</p>\n<p>UCSB has much more to look forward to besides Vincent, however, with players like junior transfer Jalen Canty and senior point guard Eric Childress.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Childress looked great, scoring 10 points, grabbing six boards and dishing out seven assists. More importantly, he had no turnovers during his 27 minutes played.</p>\n<p>Childress was actually the reason for the Gauchos’ win over the Mavericks last season, as with three seconds left he got an offensive rebound and tipped in the game-winning basket.</p>\n<p>Despite the excellent performance of the two guards, it was the big forward who made the most noise against Fresno Pacific. Canty was sensational, scoring game-high 17 points in just 18 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The California native was running up and down the floor pulling down seven rebounds and registering two blocks. The big man was also efficient as he scored 17 on 8-10 shooting from the field. He did struggle from the line, only mustering one make in five attempts, but that can be fixed as the season goes on.</p>\n<p>“I loved it [his energy], especially in the second half,” Williams said. “He was aggressive trying to score and he rebounded well in both halves.”</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Christian Terrell was also phenomenal in his first game as a Gaucho. The Sacramento native only scored six points, but dished out seven assists and was an efficient 2-4 from the three-point line. He also pulled down five rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly looked like the more dominant team against Fresno Pacific, and it was good to see everyone get a chance to play, but chances are things won’t be so easy against Nebraska-Omaha.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks return two key starters from their lineups last year in senior guard Tra-Deon Hollins and junior forward Tre’Shawn Thurman. Both were named to Summit League Preseason All-League Teams, with the senior earning a first-team nomination and the junior notching a second-team nod.</p>\n<p>Hollins, like Canty, is actually a transfer from community college. In his first season as an NCAA player, the Omaha, Nebraska native shone, averaging 12.5 points and 6.1 assists per game, and led the nation with 3.97 steals per game. The senior garnered a total of 127 steals, the most of any player in the NCAA since 2001 and the fourth most since 1985, the first time the steal was recognized as a statistic.</p>\n<p>Due to his excellent play, Hollins was recognized as Summit League Defensive Player of the Year and Transfer of the Year while also earning a Summit League All-Newcomer selection.</p>\n<p>Like his senior counterpart, Thurman also had a successful 2015-2016 campaign averaging 13.9 points, 6.7 boards and 1.3 assists per game.</p>\n<p>He finished the season with five double-double performances and scored a career-high 30 points against UMKC in a 95-89 overtime victory. Against the Gauchos last season, Thurman scored 10 points, but eight of those came in the second half.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s season opener should prove to be a fun one for both teams and even the fans involved. These are two teams that played a close match just a season ago, with the outcome determined by a game-winning basket with just seconds left.</p>\n<p>Both teams are also returning key starters, which makes the game that much more exciting as we see the battles of the two athletes happen again. With that being said, there is no doubt Santa Barbara will want a win to start the new year.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Nebraska-Omaha are set to tip off at the Thunderdome on Saturday, Nov. 12 at 2 p.m. Our twitter, @thenexus_sports, will be live tweeting the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
