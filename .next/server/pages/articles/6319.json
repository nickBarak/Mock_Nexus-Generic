It’s no surprise that rebound sex happens frequently — studies show that about one-third of college students will engage in rebound sex within a month of their breakup. Those numbers are probably even higher on a campus like ours. And, in some cases, rebound sex can be harmless. You wham, you bam, you thank your ma’am and it’s all out of your system. Look at you, getting on with your life.</p>\n<p>But is it really beneficial? Does it help ease the pain of a lost love? Unfortunately, there are no valid studies out there to show whether or not rebound sex helps anybody. All we can go on is personal experience.  And, of course, to each their own. Some people might swear by rebound sex, and others might condemn it.<br>\nI condemn it. And not because I think casual sex is wrong. If that’s your thing, you do you. I simply feel the disadvantages of engaging in rebound sex will drastically outweigh the advantages.</p>\n<p>Rebound sex is, well, awkward. I don’t understand the appeal of having a drunken night of trying to figure out how to please a complete stranger. You just came out of a long-term relationship, where your partner knew exactly how to please you and you knew exactly how to please them. Now you’re like, “Is this guy into biting? My ex was into biting.” And that guy is like, “This chick really needs to stop biting me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And then there’s the awkward post-sex moment of thinking how unsatisfying that experience was. And then — of course — you start missing your ex. And instead of feeling empowered by going out and sleeping with someone else, you end up feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>Why is this a good idea again?</p>\n<p>Not only does the whole experience seem blatantly un-enjoyable, but it can even be detrimental. Being close and intimate with someone won’t necessarily distract you from your ex. In fact, it could just end up reminding you of your ex, because you were intimate with your ex for such a long time. You’ll compare these kisses to your ex’s kisses. You’ll compare this body to your ex’s body. How could you not?</p>\n<p>And, generally, if you still have feelings for your ex, then your ex is going to win this mini competition in your head. Instead of thinking that this new sex partner is great, you’ll be lying in bed wondering if anyone will ever have abs that are as great as your ex’s were. So, instead of distracting yourself (which was your game plan in the beginning) you are inadvertently making your head explode with thoughts about how great your past love was.</p>\n<p>Motivations for rebound sex are also generally not thought through very well. Are you seeking rebound sex for revenge? Why exactly should your ex care if you sleep with someone new? If they dumped you, they probably anticipated you would have sex with someone else eventually. And anyway, it will be obvious to your ex that this “great sex” you had was actually nothing but a dig at them. It’s not an indication that you’ve moved on, it’s an indication that you are not handling the breakup well.</p>\n<p>And if you’re trying to make your ex jealous, having rebound sex isn’t the way to do either. That will most likely just make your ex angry with you or end up hurting them, and that will not make them want you back — trust me. Hearing that my ex has turned into a man-slut will not make me desire him more. And if they aren’t angry or hurt, then they’ve probably moved on and your sexcapades are pointless.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m not saying that if you’ve had rebound sex that you’re an idiot. On the contrary, very intelligent and rational people do it all the time and maybe it actually does help some. The broken-hearted will search out all avenues. I’m just pointing out the bad side and some of it’s flawed logic. If you’re just sleeping with someone to get back at an ex, it will probably not make you feel much better. And if you’re doing it to forget an ex, then that probably won’t work out too well either. I think people should be warned.</p>\n<p>Instead of focusing all your energy on having meaningless sex with someone random, maybe you should focus your energy on a new hobby or building a new friendship. Surround yourself with good people, keep distracted with projects you enjoy and try to be happy alone. Eventually, the urge to rebound will fade, and you’ll find that sexy someone who you want to start a new relationship with. And, best of all, they will be able to give you a much more enjoyable and less awkward sexual experience.</p>\n<p><em>Brenna Dilger says getting it up quickly is not always best.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Then, your group’s favorite song comes on, and just as T-Swift is going on about how “miserable and magical” you’re feeling (in the best way of course), you turn to your best friend and realize how hot she looks in that crop top and short shorts.  You’re singing, you’re grinding and out of nowhere you’re making out … What happens next is history — well, her-story really — because you let curiosity get the best of you and quite literally let the cat out of its tight, zippered bag.</p>\n<p>Let’s be honest (or should I say lesbihonest?): Sometimes, you just want to experiment outside of your sexual norms. As a gay man, there are plenty of times I like to hook up with girls just for fun, and while most of these experiences are purely erotic, devoid of any romance whatsoever, they still happen and I enjoy every second of them. With that said, I’m not the type to cuddle a girl. To be honest, I don’t even hold hands with girls and not because I don’t like them or don’t think that they’re pretty, but really because I reserve romance for men — probably because I’m gay. Still, I like to venture out and try new things, and, to be totally honest with you, I’d call you a liar if you told me that you never at least thought about doing the same.</p>\n<p>The really interesting thing about experimenting with other genders is that many of us have thought about the idea of doing it, but never really the act of doing it. What I’ve found in that past is that our brains separate eroticism and intimacy pretty well … because, let’s be real, it’s not like you want to date last Saturday’s dime piece or even your fuckbuddy. Sexual chemistry and romantic chemistry are two pretty different, albeit intertwined, concepts. I sleep with a lot of different guys, for instance, but I don’t have romantic interest in most of them, and the same goes for when I’m experimenting with girls. With that said, the first step in turning your experimental thoughts into sexual actions is to stop and realize that your sexual attraction to someone and your romantic attraction to someone are totally different from each other.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Once you’ve started to realize that intimacy and sex are totally separate concepts, you need to ask yourself: Do I want to do this?  Experimentation isn’t for everyone, and I’m not going to be the first to tell you that if you’re not comfortable breaking through your sexual boundaries just yet, you don’t have to. Still, it can be really fun to start slow, and most girls will agree that tipsy makeout sessions with your best friends can actually be really fun. And men, don’t be afraid to break social norms either, because, I’m sorry, but grabbing No. 49’s ass after the football game isn’t really that far from kissing; rather, it’s just one of many socially acceptable forms of male-on-male eroticism.</p>\n<p>With that said, I’m also here to tell you that finding members of “the other gender” (the one you don’t normally find sexually appealing) attractive doesn’t have to dictate your sexuality as a whole. I think it’s funny when straight guys ask me, “Well, how do you know if you’re gay if you haven’t tried girls yet?” Why? Because I have slept with girls and guess what, the V just doesn’t really appeal to me like the D. So on the flip-side, why have I slept with girls if I know that I’m gay? Because it’s fun. Like, really fun … it’s totally a spur-of-the-moment type thing that happens just as randomly as group sex or BDSM, and doesn’t make me straight or bi or pan or anything for that matter. Only you can define your sexuality — nobody else. And to all you straight folk out there, I’m here to tell you that flipping to the other side for a night won’t make you gay. If it did, let’s be real, I’d have a lot more gay friends than I do right now.</p>\n<p>Going back to that mention of group sex though, it’s actually a great way to initiate experimentation for those of you who are afraid to try it one-on-one. The first time I ever slept with a girl was during a threesome with another guy and, technically, that was a form of experimentation whether he wants to admit it or not — but trust me, he admits it. With that said, go ahead and ask your girlfriend for the kind of threesome she’s always dreamed of having, because guess what? Group sex not only offers you a more acceptable form of experimentation, but further, it might open you up to attractions and urges you never felt compelled or secure enough to explore in the past.</p>\n<p>All in all, experimentation can be a really fun way to spice up your sex life and explore your own interests. While lots of people are afraid of the idea of experimentation, realize that almost everyone I know has had some sort of “out-of-the norm” sexual fantasy that they couldn’t really explain, and that it’s okay for you to have them, too. In essence, sexuality isn’t black and white at all. In fact, it’s a rainbow of colors that blur together and coexist in absolute awesomeness that knows no boundaries and has no limits. In closing, let me leave you with a fun little motto I’ve recently decided to live by: Fuck the rules, because fucking rules.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Some people might find themselves smiling at the screen, remembering the gorgeous dresses, the snazzy suits and the good friends they danced the night away with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others might be greeted by a visual reminder of someone they wish they’d never met. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A graduation photo could weigh like a rock in the pit of your stomach if you’re homesick, but the person sitting next to you in class might see an image of themselves in a cap and gown as a glowing reminder of how far they’ve come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every experience is subjective, so each person’s responses to these photos are going to be different. Memories are instant gateways to a flood of emotions, and sometimes what triggers a memory comes out of nowhere: a song, a place, a picture. Remembering is neither inherently good nor bad; it’s just a bunch of chemical reactions in the brain that make us </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good or bad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For that reason, I’m constantly conflicted about these “Memories” functions that are beginning to pop up on many popular social media outlets. Sure, I get a kick out of them sometimes; when I come across a happy “memory,” I’ll feel nostalgic and send the picture to a best friend or my sister with a little heart and the caption “miss you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But once in a while, frankly, these memories just suck. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, a flashback to the group photo from my high school’s senior picnic might look perfectly fine to anyone who wasn’t there. They wouldn’t know that I spent the whole night before and much of that morning sobbing over my first breakup. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mostly remember pulling myself together just long enough to smile for the camera before calling my mom to pick me up because I was in no condition to drive home. When I look back at that photo of my smiling senior class squished together on a bus, I feel a visceral twinge in my stomach that makes me want to crawl into bed and hide all over again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I also vividly remember how frantic I was when I realized that the only picture I had of an old friend, whom I haven’t spoken to in years but who meant the world to me, had accidentally been thrown away while I was cleaning out a desk drawer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those treasured “Memories” on Snapchat was a snapshot of the glowing lights lining Santa Monica’s crowded streets. Seconds after capturing that moment, I had turned around and taken another snap of my best friend as he walked </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the only time I ever got away with taking his picture.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If remembering those moments is so important, why rely on an app to keep them alive?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s not my best friend anymore; he’s not my anything anymore. But thinking about not having that one photo as evidence, as proof of what we used to be, nearly broke my heart in two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither of these instances have convinced me whether it’s better to hold on to memories or leave them in the past, but they make me question the concept of logging onto a social media platform and being forced to remember something that otherwise may never have crossed my mind. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice to hold on or let go says something about what each of us values and holds dear. In deciding which memories to keep alive, we have to prioritize certain memories over other ones. We shouldn’t have to rely on an app to pick out which ones are important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes my sentimental side comes out and other times my “leave it all behind” side takes over. Sometimes I can’t reconcile them when it comes to more sensitive, emotionally charged memories. Usually, I don’t know which one to listen to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I don’t think the internet should have a place in making that decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">say</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that social media can’t control us, but it’s another thing to actively stop it from dictating our lives. The negative repercussions of seeing one measly picture on a phone screen proves that it can. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And being blindsided by memories that I don’t even want to think about anymore has really begun to bother me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the people who love looking at their Facebook Memories every day, I think it’s awesome that there are so many good times to look back on that make you happy. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if remembering those moments is so important, why rely on an app to keep them alive? Print out the pictures, put them on the wall or stick them in a frame, look at them every day or just when you feel like it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be stuck scouring your childhood bedroom at 1 a.m., looking for a photograph that’s no longer there, because you trusted social media to remind you of who you used to love instead of holding onto that proof yourself.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan Curiel encourages readers to preserve their memories offline.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/56bce5a21d598eca6bcfb6fdb0172be5?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/56bce5a21d598eca6bcfb6fdb0172be5?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jordan-curiel/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jordan Curiel</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jordan Curiel is an Opinion and Nexustentialism staff writer.

From </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/books/astro-poets-twitter.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter accounts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dedicated to posting daily horoscopes with half a million followers to </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drunkstrology/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pages that relate the signs to viral memes, astrology has long since graduated from the back pages of printed newspapers and taken on a life — and cult following — of its own. From Urban Outfitters graphic tees to dating apps, it has infiltrated nearly all domains of social life — I recently came across a Tinder bio that read, “Add me on Co-Star.” It seems as though the astrology obsession has become a cultural norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the initial weeks after I downloaded the app, I let the daily horoscope notifications pile up. I dismissed them as corny platitudes (“Drastic times call for drastic measures” or “You can give them a chance today”) and eventually let them get lost in the mix of breaking news headlines and Facebook event notifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then suddenly, the stars aligned and my horoscope started to get it absolutely right — almost disturbingly so. On the day Co-Star sent me, “If you want people to communicate with your heart, you have to teach them the language it speaks in,” my sister and I had just resolved a week-long fight. When I received, “It’s time to grow past your fundamental injuries from when your primary caregivers failed to understand you,” it reminded me to stop wallowing and pull my head out of my ass. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instantly, I was hooked. I gave myself to the trusting hands of the cosmos. Doubts of “this is literally just a company who pays people to write these” and “it’s all about perception” got squashed by the immediate rush of validation and satisfaction I got from reading and confirming for the first time what a true Sagittarius I apparently was: headstrong, stubborn and spontaneous to a fault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself. That I didn’t need unique passions or interests because everybody seemed to already have their own ideas of who a Sagittarius was. It was more comforting than I cared to admit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day, I would screenshot my horoscope and send it my friends, exclaiming, “That’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> me!” while hundreds of thousands of other Co-Star users did the same thing, claiming the generic platitude as their own. Still, it would give me an extra boost of confidence that would stay with me throughout the day.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to live for the eerie sense that an inanimate entity (a fucking app) knew me better than I knew myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-Star allows you to lean into a list of traits that the Internet says makes you a “total Virgo” and base your identity, quirks and strengths on a personality that has already been curated for you. For a time, it made being 20 seem simple. These accurate (or what coincidentally happened to be accurate) horoscopes gave me a sense of control over my life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world. It asserts itself as a philosophy without room for doubt and provides a self-assured confidence that is extremely attractive. The 12 sun signs — based on birth month — are taken not as suggestions or fortunes, but as permanent and reliable fixtures in our society, each with their own set of “individualized” principles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stopped being a die-hard believer in astrology when I started to notice discrepancies between myself and what my sign was supposed to be. </span><a href=\"https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/zodiac-signs/sagittarius/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sagittariuses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are generous, idealistic, extroverted, cursed with an insatiable case of wanderlust and truth-seeking. They are “independent and strong-willed,” “natural born leaders,” “seductive” and “trailblazing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are wildly broad claims that feel more descriptive of a video game character than a real person. I don’t know anyone, let alone myself, who embodies </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of these statements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a defense for these blanket statements: the generalized qualities of the sun signs only scratch the surface of astrology. Apparently, your moon sign explains it all. And to figure out your moon sign you need to know what time you were born.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know what time I was born because I’m adopted, so I tried to deduce my moon sign by process of elimination. Each day, I read the horoscopes of all the moon signs and took note on which felt the most accurate. By the end of my two-week trial, 168 horoscopes later, I came to the conclusion that a Gemini moon seemed a likely fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of this pseudo-experiment, I discovered I still had the same nagging feeling of incompleteness that I had when I first started. I didn’t feel a loyalty to any of the signs and was even beginning to doubt whether my Sagittarius-ness held any value. The fact that a Leo moon tended to gravitate to the spotlight more than a Cancer felt like arbitrary information, even silly. I didn’t possess the authority to claim I belonged to one over the other because I still didn’t have anything to prove it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d spent too much of my time and energy in the world of astrology to come out feeling just as confused as I had at the beginning. It felt like I was promised clarity on the condition that I figured out my birth time, and only then would I be able to access this wealth of knowledge about myself. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Astrology provided security because it was a way of creating order in an orderless world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A part of me knew that it wouldn’t have mattered anyway. This piece of myself I’d attached so much value to and made myself feel guilty for not knowing was trivial. What was more revealing than anything was how far I had let myself spiral into an astrology obsession. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My faith was based on insecurity. I wanted (and still want) to fast-forward through my bumbling 20s and college years to this fully developed version of myself that doesn’t exist. I wanted it to be as easy as picking an avatar in a game, complete with attractive, likeable traits I didn’t have to work for or even think about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought I could use astrology as a cure-all for my doubts and anxieties about the future. For reconciling the contradictions in my personality, justifying habits of self-sabotage, for not feeling like I was not 100% any one quality. Surely one day I would develop into the full-blown Sagittarius I was if I just believed a little more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe me, I tried. I based entire relationships on whether our signs were compatible or not. Even worse, I judged other people for not believing in it too, this dogma based on fear and escapism posing as cute personality traits and trendy finger tattoos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of this summer, I realized I was cheating myself. I had avoided engaging and actually thinking about my choices and beliefs for an embarrassingly long time. Where I had once felt confident claiming all the ways I was “such a Sagittarius,” this persona began to feel meaningless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I did see clearly was how quickly I blindly attached myself to this belief in astrology. It was something to grasp onto, something that promised answers and truths that I became convinced I would never find without it. It assuaged feelings of self-doubt and social anxiety. I was learning to love the provided answers; I was learning to love not being me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little by little, I am learning how to relinquish my grip on astrology. </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff astrologer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/broadly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Annabel Gat, puts it simply: “It’s a tool for self-reflection, it’s not a religion or a science. It’s just a way to look at the world and a way to think about things.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realize that for most people, astrology doesn’t evolve into this type of unhealthy obsession and codependency. But I do question the underlying and often subconscious motivations of its young target audience. I do question its ability to influence its followers into a kind of group-think that poses as innocent, harmless fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying into astrology meant being content living my life like a game of Sims on autopilot. A choose-your-own-adventure, but even lazier because someone else had already chosen all the adventures for me.
