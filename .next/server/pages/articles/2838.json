Ryder, Director of the San Diego Zoo’s Frozen Zoo Project and Chair of the Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, delivers a talk on reviving extinct species.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) hosted a talk on the possibilities of resurrecting extinct life by Oliver A. Ryder titled “Conservation, De-Extinction, and the Future of Life” in the HSSB McCune Conference Room on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Ryder is the Director of the Frozen Zoo Project at the San Diego Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, a project that freezes cell samples and DNA from over half a million endangered organisms in an effort to save species coming close to extinction.</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, there is increased global concern for conservation and he is disappointed in the United States’ lack of participation in international conservation treaties.</p>\n<p>“The international community is making goals to provide standards and higher expectations to express these problems on a global basis,” Ryder said. “Our country is one of the great minority in the world that has not participated in the discussion since we did sign the Convention [on] Biological Diversity. We have a major role to play in the involvement of these discussions one way or another.”</p>\n<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity is a multilateral international treaty signed in 1992 by over 150 countries across the world pledging a commitment to ensure conservation of biological diversity within their borders. As of 2014, the U.S. has signed but not ratified the conditions of the 1992 agreement.</p>\n<p>Ryder said the now extinct Hawaiian po’o-uli bird was been studied in the Frozen Zoo Project using cells of the bird from previously acquired genetic samples.</p>\n<p>“[The Po’ouli bird] is a real just a tragic story and a prime example of dysfunction,” Ryder said. “However we were able to receive some DNA of the species before the bird died and we were able to grow some living cells out of it. It was a surreal experience. How the cells are growing vivaciously and seeing the chromosomes being created and just knowing the organism is gone.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, in 1987 conservationists counted the amount of California Condors and found a shockingly low total population of about 20 birds. Participants took samples of and tagged each individual bird and found they were struggling to survive due to lead pollution, according to Ryder who participated in the project.</p>\n<p>“We used DNA fingerprinting on 23 condors and found each Condor to only three clans and found they have a genetic disease, like a lethal dwarfism that prevented chicks from hatching, resulting from lead in the environment,” Ryder said. “As a result of that, Governor Brown signed a bill banning lead bullets, but California is the only state to do this even though the condor is present in Arizona and Utah.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said one of the biggest success stories is of the black-footed ferret, which was thought to have been extinct but reappeared in Wyoming in 1981. Seven of the ferrets brought to captivity reproduced successfully using artificial semen, a process that increases genetic diversity.</p>\n<p>“Currently, all 8,000 ferrets in captivity came from seven individuals,” Ryder said. “We received skin biopsies samples from ferrets who were alive earlier to create artificial semen. The semen was then used on the seven individuals who gave birth to ferrets that now have more genetic diversity, which will help the overall survival of the black footed ferret species.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, the only way to help increase genetic diversity of endangered animals is by cloning, which he considers an expensive procedure.</p>\n<p>“Cloning is the only way to do it,” Ryder said. “However this is used as a model for cystic fibrosis research. There are ferrets who are given the gene for the human form of cystic fibrosis that are then used as test subjects for medication treatment. They can take the ferret cell but it costs about $50,000 to $150,000.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said the San Diego Zoo is attempting to use Frozen Zoo Project samples to save the only five remaining northern white rhinoceros, but that saving the animals will not be enough to save the species if the rhinos do not breed.</p>\n<p>“We took some cells from one of the rhinos and grew stem cells from them, which can make any cells in the body,” Ryder said. “Theoretically we can save the white rhinos, however the rhinos aren’t repopulating. There are five walking around, but if there is no offspring, they might as well be extinct already.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, future generations are raised with notions of potentially saving endangered species, and must decide the future of manipulating genomes.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to watch movies like ‘Ice Age’ because it assaults everything we know about DNA and genes, but this is the world our children are growing up in,” Ryder said. “They’re growing up believing this is possible, and it might be, but it’s up to them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Bree Brydenthal said she believes scientists need to work purposefully when conducting research and should consider whether their work will benefit the community.</p>\n<p>“I think the question that has to be asked is what is the point of them branching out to bring these animals into a world we don’t need them in,” Brydenthal said. “Is it beneficial to our current ecosystem or will it have serious environmental consequences? I think we have to determine what place it will have.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Brianna Acuesta said freezing samples could lead to moral debates among researchers and the general public.</p>\n<p>“In terms of morality, it’s the issues that come up of this topic,” Acuesta said. “People are talking about cloning or bringing back animals that necessarily don’t have a place in our world right now. But also we’re not talking about mammoths, we’re talking about species such as the passenger pigeon too.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

The task force also released a list of demands on Wednesday, calling for “the demilitarization of police at major events such as Halloween and Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Anonymous members of the Task Force said in an email the protest and list of demands were aimed at resisting the increase of over-policing, militant practices and profit-based ticketing in I.V. and on campus.</p>\n<p>“We came across the page ‘Keep Isla Vista Safe.’ This page proclaims to operate as a community effort to maintain order and safety throughout the streets of Isla Vista,”<br>\nthe members said in an email. “Instead, this campaign boastingly intimidates students with memes regarding the increase of profitable restrictions and police presence.”</p>\n<p>According to Task Force members, student demonstrations and demands have been presented to university administration in order to bring attention to the relationship between increased police presence and tension between students, I.V. residents and authority figures.</p>\n<p>“When students see so many police officers swarming the streets of Isla Vista, walking around with their hands on their guns, it creates a hostile environment that makes students feel unsafe and defensive, as though they have already been profiled as criminals,” members said in an email. “This atmosphere is what produces unfortunate events like the riot that occurred during Deltopia last year.”</p>\n<p>The Task Force’s demands call for “redirection of funds from tickets into restorative programs and educational safety courses” and insist “all law enforcement officers participate in a required cultural competency and diversity training,” aimed to educate officers “on the emotional, social and psychological effects of police presence experienced by students of color and other marginalized groups.”</p>\n<p>Demonstrators in the Arbor wore black and placed duct tape over their mouths, asking passing students to sign a “stop over-policing” petition directed toward Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Members also called for students to participate in a photo project called “300+,” in which students wrote one descriptive word about their reaction to the planned presence of over 300 police officers in I.V. for Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“Students have expressed that Isla Vista policing makes them feel threatened, triggered, targeted, criminalized, nervous, unsafe, uncomfortable, and exploited,” the members said in an email. “We believe that the photos and expressions from the community highlight the general consensus from students and I.V. residents that large numbers of police do not make them feel protected or safe, but rather the opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year global studies major Ogui González Vilá, the increase of ordinances and restrictions during Deltopia weekend alienate students from police.</p>\n<p>“I wish that there was just more collaboration between students and police in events like these,” Vilá said. “I know there are other alternatives to discourage people from attending Deltopia other than using police scare tactics.”</p>\n<p>The Task Force on Police Brutality finally stated that their demands be “implemented within the next 3-6 months,” with Yang’s official response expected “no later than 5 p.m. on April 8th 2015.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 the Thursday, April 2, 2015 print edition.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/students-protest-keep-isla-vista-safe-campaign/","id":2837,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2836,2835,2834],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
