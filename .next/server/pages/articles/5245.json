They’re a serious team, so I knew it wasn’t going to be an easy game.” UCLA Head Coach Adam Wright said. “We needed to make some stops throughout the end and we were able to.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Bruins battled throughout the game with neither team leading by more than a two score advantage at any point. UCSB started the game aggressively, scoring on the opening possession via a bounced shot by freshman 2M Lazar Komadinic. UCLA responded quickly with a goal of its own when senior center Jacob Murphy backhanded one into the left side of the net from near the 2m line.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, UCSB senior utility player Milos Golic scored three goals and fellow senior Zsombor Vincze scored one, giving the Gauchos a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Though the second half was primarily a defensive affair, the intensity increased in the fourth quarter when UCLA tied the game up 7-7 early into the period. A few minutes later, UCSB’s Vincze scored off of a shot deflected by the UCLA goalie. UCLA tied the game up once again though when utility player Josh Samuels rebounded a missed shot and scored for the 8-8 tie.</p>\n<p>Less than a minute later, UCLA’s physical style of play paid off once again when Murphy netted the game-deciding goal from around the 2 meter line. UCSB’s Golic and Gronow attempted to equalize it and force overtime, but UCLA managed to stop the Gauchos on consecutive possessions to close out the match.</p>\n<p>“We need a little more intensity and motivation in the last two minutes. It seemed like throughout the game that we can win the game.” Golic said. “We had the lead almost three quarters. I think people were really scared, we didn’t have that motivation in the last moment to pull it out.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, the Gauchos had difficulty stopping UCLA from getting the ball inside and exploiting its opportunities near the net. The game winning goal was the third of the day for UCLA’s Murphy and his second from near the 2 meter line, where UCSB  allowed four of UCLA’s nine goals.</p>\n<p>“We have trouble with that against other teams too, I think that’s a thing that we need to be improved for the coming [conference] tournament.” Golic said. “That’s basically where everything’s going to be determined. “If we play this way with a little more velocity, I think we can pass the first round [of the tournament].”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will finish off its regular season on Nov. 20 against Pepperdine University at Campus Pool. Both teams are tied for seventh place in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>“[It’s] very disappointing to lose a game like this at home, but at the same time we’re playing well and we’re going to try to take that momentum into the conference tournament.” Wigo said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/29776/","id":5245,"author":{"id":307,"name":"David Washington"},"related":[5244,5243,5242],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":307,"name":"David Washington","biography":"Not available","articles":[1699,1724,1731,1742,5245,6006,6050,6055,6078],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Falls to BYU in MPSF Semifinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensVolleyballCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensVolleyballCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's season ended this weekend as the Gauchos were swept by BYU in the MPSF semifinals.

Multiple BYU attack errors and two kills from senior outside hitter Matt Hanley kept the match even at 7-7. BYU turned it around with three blocks and a service ace from senior outside hitter Taylor Sander to take a dominant 15-9 lead. UCSB found its rhythm and was able to pull within four, but Sander’s dominant offensive performance carried the Cougars to an easy victory in the first set.</p>\n<p>“They were just serving a lot better than we were. They are used to the environment down there,” Seif said.</p>\n<p>In the second set, the Gauchos stepped up earning a .222 hitting clip, their highest of the night. As a team, UCSB hit just .086 in comparison to BYU’s .273. Senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson opened up the set with two kills for the Gauchos, giving them an early 4-2 lead. Three consecutive attack errors from UCSB and a service ace from junior outside hitter Josue Rivera made it easy for BYU to regain the lead. The Cougars held the lead until late in the set when the Gauchos tied it at 18-18. Both teams exchanged points back and forth until a kill from Sander and a UCSB service error ended the set in favor of the Cougars.</p>\n<p>The third set proved that the momentum was not going to shift in time for the Gauchos to pull off another miraculous comeback. Despite a consistent offensive push from Hanley, the Gauchos could not get their momentum going. Two of UCSB’s key hitters, redshirt junior Weston Nielsen and senior opposite Evan Licht, could not withstand the BYU block. The Cougars outblocked the Gauchos 17.5-3.0 on the night. BYU’s sophomore middle blocker Michael Hatch had a career-high 13 blocks against UCSB.</p>\n<p>“They had us out of system so it made their job a lot easier to key in our attackers,” Thompson said. “They had us out of system for the entire game so we were really only able to go to two people.”</p>\n<p>After this loss, the Gauchos were eliminated from the conference tournament and were not selected to play in the NCAA tournament. BYU went on to face Stanford on Saturday night, sweeping the Cardinal in a 3-0 match and claiming the title as the MPSF champions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-falls-to-byu-in-mpsf-semifinals/","id":5242,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5241,5240,5239],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Add Six Freshmen to Roster","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensVolleyball4PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomensVolleyball4PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=410%2C597&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has big shoes to fill with the departures of several key seniors.

After her senior season at St. Lucy’s Priory High School, Bast earned All-CIF honors and was named the San Gabriel Valley Tribune Player of the Year. With four league titles and two CIF Championships throughout high school, her history of winning is something that can surely help the Gauchos as they look to repeat as Big West champs.</p>\n<p>“Sydney is a really consistent player and we noticed that she has the skills as both a passer and a defender,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>Coming into the team at 5’8”, Kelly Bielaski is the tallest of the three new liberos. During her time at Dougherty Valley High School, Bielaski set the school records for career kills, digs and aces on her way to earning two Offensive Player of the Year awards and being named MVP after her senior year.</p>\n<p>“What really stood out from [Kelly] was her passing ability,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s a really bright kid and I think that can translate well to the court.”</p>\n<p>The last of the three liberos is Jane Lamp from Thousand Oaks High School. At just 5’3”, Lamp helped lead her team to three consecutive undefeated seasons in league play and was named the team’s Best Defensive Player in her junior year. In each of her last two high school seasons, Lamp was named to the All-Marmonte League First Team as well as the All-Ventura County team.</p>\n<p>“Jane’s a go-getter. She’s not going to let her small stature get in her way,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s a really energetic, fiery player and just brings a lot of energy to the court.”</p>\n<p>Adding offensive firepower will be outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. Hoffman finished her high school career with a Riverside County record of 1,338 kills and earned numerous postseason awards including Div. II Player of the Year and All-CIF Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Chanel is an all-around player and she’s going to have an opportunity to impact the game in both the front row and the back row,” Lantagne Welch said. “One of her strengths is her ability to do so many things well.”</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB’s good young group of middle blockers and outside hitters is 6’3” Megan Sullivan. After leading the way in her senior year with an impressive .353 hitting percentage, she was named to the Delta River All-League team and the Sacramento Bee All-Metro team.</p>\n<p>“Megan is a high-touching player,” Lantagne Welch said. “Just to get another good athlete in the program that’s playing a high level along the net is going to help our team tremendously.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the new recruits is setter/right-side hitter Noa Nightingale. A teammate of Sullivan’s in high school, Nightingale was listed in PrepVolleyball’s Players to Watch and Seniors Aces list as she went for 197 kills in her senior year without missing a start.</p>\n<p>“Noa gives us a lot of depth and flexibility,” Lantagne Welch said. “She’s really going to have some different looks depending on how everyone shapes out in the positions and whatnot. She’s a really hard worker and we’re excited about her versatility.”</p>\n<p>Last season, UCSB utilized numerous freshmen on its way to a Big West league title.

It was pretty cool beating the snot out of them.”</p>\n<p>The third-seeded Gauchos will be facing sixth-seeded UC Berkeley this Saturday at 3 p.m.  The second round game will be played later that day, and the final game is set for Sunday.</p>\n<p>Nagle expressed confidence in the team’s first round match up with Berkeley and hopes the team goes farther than last year.  In 2009, the Gauchos lost in the semifinals of the state championships, giving them a third place finish.</p>\n<p>“We have a colorful team with strong senior leadership, a few grad students and some talented freshman coming off a summer with the intercollegiate team,” Nagle said.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t gotten a chance to see them play,” Allain said of Berkeley.  “So everyone will be coming into the game prepared and ready to play out the game.”</p>\n<p>“We think we’re gonna beat them,” Nagle said.  “The top three from the north aren’t as good as the top three from the south.”  The state championships include the top four teams from both the northern and southern regions.</p>\n<p>If they win, the Gauchos will likely play UC Davis in the second round top-seeded UCLA in the championship.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of respect between us and UCLA,” Nagle mentioned.  “Their game last weekend was clean compared [to the USC game].”</p>\n<p>The team that wins at the state level will advance to Nationals.  Nagle explained that there are more quality teams in California than in the rest of the country.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost easier to win Nationals,” he said.</p>\n<p>Holmblad also holds high expectations for this weekend, assuming the whole team makes the trip.</p>\n<p>“We have the most talent [out of anyone in the tournament], but we have a problem with commitment,” Holmblad said.  “We haven’t played a single game this season with all our starters.  If we can get everyone to show up, we can do very well.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-22/thirdseeded-club-polo-state-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-22/thirdseeded-club-polo-state-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-22/thirdseeded-club-polo-state-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-22/thirdseeded-club-polo-state-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-22/thirdseeded-club-polo-state-championship/","id":5244,"author":{"id":192,"name":"David Russo"},"related":[5243,5242,5241],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
