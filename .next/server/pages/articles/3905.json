The officers approached the crowd to investigate what was happening.</p>\n<p>According to one of the spectators, they had been walking by when they spotted the student passed out in the bushes. They then dragged him to the curb and attempted to ascertain a place they could take him.</p>\n<p>But as the deputies discovered, the ruined reveler was in no state to be answering questions. Sitting there with his head hanging low, the UCSB student had the whole spectrum of bodily fluids staining his body, including a mucus-covered face, vomit-stained shirt and urine-soaked jeans.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the deputies began dragging the man to a patrol car that they got anything out of him: projectile vomit.</p>\n<p>After soiling the back seat of the patrol car, the man was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Say My Name</strong></p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 21, 10:49 p.m. — An act of drunken vandalism proved disastrous for one Isla Vista resident.</p>\n<p>Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by a distraught female complaining that an inebriated passerby had snapped the antenna off her car. What’s more, she told the officers her friends had kept the vandal in place through the cunning use of distraction.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the 18-year-old man and could immediately tell he was exceptionally drunk. They asked the man his name, to which he replied, “What’s my name.” When asked his age, he replied “What’s my age.”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the inebriated local would answer by simply repeating the question. Frustrated, the officers arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: To Be Expected</strong></p>\n<p>Sun., Nov. 22, 12:22 a.m. — Deputies on patrol couldn’t help but notice an especially raucous partier stumbling down Del Playa Drive early Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>With a plastic beer helmet snuggly in place atop his head, the 18-year-old struggled to navigate the bustle surrounding him. After nearly falling on own his volition, the Cal Poly Mustang then stumbled into a fair-skinned Gaucho, who nearly fell herself.</p>\n<p>After being told off, the drunken man turned and tried out his best pick up line: “Fuck you!” But instead of snatching one of Isla Vista’s famed beauties, he was snatched by I.V.’s other famed demographic, the not-so-beautiful Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>A quick conversation with the foul-mouthed Mustang was all the fodder the officers needed, who promptly arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/","id":3905,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3904,3903,3902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[3554,3571,3752,3825,3827,3828,3829,3830,3831,3833,3835,3842,3887,3902,3903,3905,3906],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Oct. 9, 11:11 p.m. - Officers navigating the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive went to work when they spotted a barefooted young lady leaning against a parked car.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fast Times at Dos Pueblos High</p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 9, 11:11 p.m. – Officers navigating the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive went to work when they spotted a barefooted young lady leaning against a parked car.</p>\n<p>The deputies walked over and asked the petite drinker how she was feeling, but her attempts at making conversation came out only as gibberish.</p>\n<p>The officer then asked if she knew where she was, and she replied, “I’m 18. I’m 18. I know. I know.” He tried the question again, but again she muttered the same response. Ten times he asked, and always got the same answer.</p>\n<p>But when asked her date of birth, the “18-year-old” told them 7-4-92, making her 17. When told this, she started to cry and tried to walk away.</p>\n<p>But the officer caught a glimpse of her cell phone and asked to use it to call her mother. Once on the line, mommy told the deputy her darling daughter was in fact 16 years old.</p>\n<p>The officers then walked the Dos Pueblo junior to the I.V. police station, where her mother was set to meet them. With mother and daughter reunited, the soon-to-be-grounded-forever young lady stood up to leave and immediately vomited on the floor.</p>\n<p>But mommy was there to insist paramedics take her to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, where she was housed, pending an unhappy conversation with the ‘rents.</p>\n<p>A Friend in Need</p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 9, 12:43 a.m. – Deputies on patrol were dispatched to an apartment complex on the 6600 block of Del Playa on reports there was an intoxicated squatter in the apartment.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and the tenants told them that an unknown guy had walked right through the front door, vomited in the living room and then fell fast asleep on the couch.</p>\n<p>Making sure not to step in his pile of sick, the deputies made their way toward the couch and found the 19-year-old man passed out face down in a pile of his own vomit.</p>\n<p>After much effort, the officers woke the heavily inebriated man and got him to his feet. Having lost his shirt somewhere, the man was led out into the cold night air with dried vomit clinging to his bare chest.</p>\n<p>Always willing to take in a friend in need, the deputies then transported the sleepy squatter to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/","id":3902,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3901,3900,3899],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I.V.

Hosts: Dancing With the Idiots</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 25, 11:35 p.m. — Officers patrolling a busy Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but take notice as a flamboyant 18-year-old strutted by.</p>\n<p>With revelry in the air, the young man had decided to entertain the masses with his groovy dance moves… from atop a moving car.</p>\n<p>As the vehicle made its way through the crowd surrounding it, the deputies made their way towards the tipsy-toed dancer and yelled at him to get down. The inebriated performer was in the zone, however, and failed to heed the officer’s demand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, having already tried their hands at diplomacy, reverted to plan B and grabbed the artist by the shirt and dragged him to the ground.</p>\n<p>With his run as lead dancer in the Car-top Cabaret over, the rising star was forced to face the music and stood motionless as the deputies slapped on the cuffs.</p>\n<p>And the Damage Done</p>\n<p>Sun., Sept. 27, 1:13 a.m. — A late night altercation in a Del Playa parking lot turned out to be more than one officer could handle.</p>\n<p>Once on the scene, the officers approached a bloodied 18-year-old and asked him what had happened, to which he replied, “Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz…” Pressed further, the out-of-towner continued to ramble about California’s favorite hippie enclave, but ironically, refused to say where he was from.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the deputy arrested him and sat him on the curb to wait for a van to take him to jail. But the slug wasn’t ready to be salted just yet, and while the officer was looking down at his notepad, he made his break and started sprinting down the street.</p>\n<p>The deputy made chase, and his attempts to taser the escapee failed. And then his own legs failed him: just paces from catching up, the officer lost his footing and ate shit in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers don’t work alone, though, and a fellow member of the Foot Patrol was able to tackle the fleeing northerner. The damage, however, had already been done.</p>\n<p>If Only It Was Twist-Off</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 15, 11:28 p.m. — Deputies on patrol near the intersection of Camino Del Sur and Pasado Road stopped an inebriated man after he stumbled into several parked cars.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the unsteady stroller where he lived, and he was quick to tell them that he lived at “243 Sabado.” But before the deputies could tell him such an address doesn’t exist, he pointed to a house at the corner of the intersection and told them he lived there.</p>\n<p>Feeling pretty certain that the 20-year-old was making things up, the deputies asked the lost boy if he could call a friend to walk him home. The drunken UCSB student said he could and proceeded to pull out his keys from his front pocket.</p>\n<p>Unsure of his intentions, the officers asked him a second time if he would call a friend. This time, the man pointed to a bottle opener attached to his keys and said, “O.K., it’s right here.”</p>\n<p>Whether he thought the bottle opener was a phone, or perhaps a friendly escort, the officers couldn’t tell, but such clarification was not needed to arrest him for public intoxication.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

shootings and other gun-related deaths.</p>\n<p>Sunday night’s Concert Across America to End Gun Violence in Arlington Theatre touched upon recent memories of tragedy in Santa Barbara. It pushed for gun reform in light of local deaths due to gun violence, including <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-03-25/suspect-arrested-in-diabolical-triple-homicide/\" target=\"_blank\">the murder of the Han family on March 25</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/sheriff-releases-report-detailing-events-of-2014-i-v-mass-murder/\" target=\"_blank\">the mass shooting of six students on May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista</a>.</p>\n<p>The concert featured several artists from the southern California area, locally based and world famous. Individuals closely affected by the numerous acts of gun violence in recent years spoke to the crowd of over 2,000 people.</p>\n<p>“Like you, I’m here to enjoy some great music and celebrate the lives of those who were stolen from us,” said Bob Weiss in his opening remarks Sunday night. Weiss’s daughter, Veronika Weiss, was one of the six victims of the Isla Vista shooting.</p>\n<p>Weiss urged those in attendance to become “opinion leaders” in the Santa Barbara community, to push for gun law reform in order to “form a more perfect union.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72611\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2116263089\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72607\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72611\" data-attachment-id=\"72611\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-8-06-08-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?fit=1390%2C745&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1390,745\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-8-06-08-pm\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?fit=888%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72611\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=450%2C241\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-8-06-08-pm\" width=\"450\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?w=1390&amp;ssl=1 1390w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=768%2C412&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-8.06.08-PM.png?resize=1024%2C549&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72611\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bob Weiss, father of Veronika Weiss, urges the 2,000 audience members to become “opinion leaders” in the Santa Barbara community. <em>Courtesy of Concert Across America</em></p></div>\n<p>“It’s a matter of life and death,” he said. “Let me tell you from experience: nowhere in this country is safe from gun violence. We know that all too well here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Weiss then introduced on stage local musician Daniela Spagnola, a next-door neighbor to the Weiss family who dedicated her song “Peace Will Light the Way” to the memory of Veronika Weiss.</p>\n<p>Dr. Jason Prystowsky, the emergency physician who worked in Cottage Hospital in Goleta on the night of May 23, 2014, shared his experiences working in cities around the country where emergency rooms see several gunshot victims in a given night, which he said tends to make physicians “hardened” to gun violence.</p>\n<p>“The night of May 23, 2014, was a little different; this hit very close to home.” he said. “That which always happens somewhere else happened here, and that shook us up a bit.”</p>\n<p>Prystowsky posed a few questions to the audience: “Why is it so much easier to acquire a gun than it is to acquire a psychiatrist?” and “Would a well-armed Isla Vista have made the body count higher or lower?” (Several in the audience yelled “higher” following the latter question).</p>\n<p>On video, celebrities like film actor Jeff Bridges and singer-songwriter Jack Johnson, both of whom are Santa Barbara-area residents, asked listeners to vote for candidates who are “passionate about ending gun violence,” as Johnson put it.</p>\n<p>Students from local singing schools DMK Studio and the Santa Barbara School of Performing Arts performed a song called “A Song of Peace” in memory of Emily Han, the 5-year-old daughter killed in March along with her mother and father. Han was a student at DMK Studio.</p>\n<p>Taking the stage also were musical performances from UC Santa Barbara’s Naked Voices, who performed the Leonard Cohen song “Hallelujah,” and Lois Mahalia with the One Voice Choir.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles-based Latin group Ozomatli played a longer set just before the concert’s 20-minute intermission. During this time, event organizers hosted a silent auction to fundraise the Santa Barbara Gun Buyback Program.</p>\n<p>The latter part of the evening featured Venice, another L.A.-based rock band comprised of two brothers and their two cousins. Frontman Kipp Lennon shared how their family has also lost someone to gun violence — his father — and how they have “survived and grown closer” and have “tried to make music out of that.”</p>\n<p>Concluding the evening were headliners Kenny Loggins, who brought on local talents like Santa Barbara High School senior Jackson Gillies, and Michael McDonald.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/concert-seeks-end-to-gun-violence-honors-shooting-victims/","id":3904,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3903,3902,3901],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
