Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Hawaii hasn’t lost since an overtime match with Long Beach State on Oct. 8, and it dominated the last match against UCSB in straight sets, 25-20, 25-14, 25-19. The Rainbow Wahine have only dropped one set since the LBSU match and have now swept seven straight league opponents, including that same 49ers team two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Rainbow Wahine senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor has been one of the league’s premier scorers this season, racking up 4 kills per set in conference play. She’s aided by sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato and middle hitters senior Annie Mitchem and junior Emily Maglio, each of whom rank in the top 25 for kills per set against Big West competition with at least 2.20.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Maglio paces all players with a .409 kill percentage against conference competition, as she’s been good for 100 kills and only 17 errors over the span. Mitchem also ranks fourth with a .353 hitting percentage, completing what has been a ferociously efficient duo in the middle for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos, Hawaii also relies on first-year setter Norene Iosia. UCSB’s redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley and Iosia have put up very similar stats through their respective Big West schedules, as Iosia barely trails Juley’s mark of 10.35 assists per set with 10.20 of her own.</p>\n<p>Iosia is coming off double-doubles in her last two matches, with 33 assists and 12 digs against UC Davis following a 28 assist and 11 dig effort against UC Irvine,</p>\n<p>Hawaii is one of two teams in the Big West without a player averaging four digs per set in conference play, though junior libero Savanah Kahakai’s 3.96 figure is just shy of the mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi and every one of her 4.59 digs per set against Big West foes Saturday, as she presents a situation where UCSB may have a talent advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue to ride the offensive shockwaves of their redshirt first-years Lindsey Ruddins and Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>Ruddins has been seventh-best in kills per set during Big West play, averaging 3.70. While she was relatively shut down with 12 kills in the match against UC Riverside, Ruddins had 27 kills in a monster outing against Cal State Fullerton the night before, showing just how deadly she can be.</p>\n<p>Juley had 94 assists over this past weekend, 47 in each match, and will have to be on her A-game for the Gauchos to have a shot against the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>She’s been on an upward trajectory throughout the year, a trend that will need to continue for the first-year if UCSB is to have any hope of their postseason dreams becoming reality.</p>\n<p>Mindset will be important for the Gauchos heading into the final two matches. With their playoff hopes lingering in uncertainty, intensity is a focus for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We can go into this with absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “An aggressive mindset is absolutely what we need.”</p>\n<p>Relating to gains throughout their season, UCSB’s best weekends this year have come after stretches of great practices, a trend that was shaken last week.</p>\n<p>“Over the last month, every week we’ve had great practices except for last week,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “They know that, they recognize that and they realize how important that is and how much it carries over to the games. The key is that we just stay confident.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and maintain that confidence and defeat a Hawaii team that has appeared, at times, unbeatable.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to breathe some fire back into their season on Saturday night, facing off against Hawaii at 9 p.m. Pacific time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November, 17 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74290\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74290\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/","id":4999,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4998,4997,4996],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Earns First Conf.

A Second-Team All-Big West selection last season, Murphy was named the tournament MVP.</p>\n<p>Enabling UCSB to reach the championship round was the fourth-year player’s game-winning goal in the second sudden victory period of the game following two overtime periods and one sudden victory session.</p>\n<p>“Sam really stepped it up this weekend. She was on the outside, inside, in transition, I mean she was everywhere,” Kay explained. “She’s co-captain with Lauren so she holds a big leadership role on the team. Additionally, she’s Big West scholar of the year, she’s got a 4.0 GPA. She’s the whole package.”</p>\n<p>Complementing the productive weekend performance of Murphy was UCSB’s attentive defense as it held each of its opponents to six or less goals, nearly two goals below its average allowance of 8.07 entering its contest versus the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ defense was most effective in the first half of Sunday’s matchup as they shutout Hawaii in the second period following their allowance of just one goal in the opening quarter of the game. Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a total of seven saves.</p>\n<p>Although Murphy would go on to tally her third hat trick in the second half of Sunday’s game, the scoring contributions of redshirt center Lauren Martin with a first half hat trick, senior attacker Bryn Hudson, and junior utility Taylor Shore helped UCSB earn a 5-1 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Rainbow Wahine managed to limit the Gauchos to one goal in the third period, Hawaii was unable to transform its defense into offense as freshman attacker Hannah Thompson was the lone goal scorer in the playing frame, which didn’t have much of a toll of the tam’s deficit as it still trailed 6-2.</p>\n<p>Despite scoring three goals in the game’s final period, Hawaii’s inconsistencies on defense hindered its comeback attempt as UCSB responded with five goals of its own to secure its championship victory.</p>\n<p>Included within UCSB’s championship run was an 8-4 win over No. 24 Cal State Northridge and its 7-6 sudden victory over No. 7 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>As a winner of three national championships in her four seasons as a starter at UCLA from 1996-2000, Coach Kay is hoping to integrate her extensive postseason experience along with her coaching abilities in preparing the Gauchos for their first NCAA appearance.</p>\n<p>“Something I learned as a player and throughout my coaching years going to the ‘Big Dance,’ it’s important to keep things in perspective,” Kay said. “We got here because of our hard work, team defense, and paying attention to the details and that’s what makes the difference. From my UCLA days, [according to a] John Wooden quote — ‘Little things makes big things happen,’ and that’s what we focused on this year and it worked.”</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will be held at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center from Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15.

The Gauchos are set to face the No. 2 Stanford Cardinals in the first round as announced in the NCAA Selection Show the following Monday after Santa Barbara’s title victory.</p>\n<p>The Cardinals, who ended their regular season with a 21-5 overall record, were the runners up this year in the MPSF Tournament. Stanford lost to the top-ranked team in the nation, USC, after a dominating fourth quarter by the Trojans in which they put away five goals, making it difficult for the Cardinals to come back.</p>\n<p>After the decision was announced as to who UCSB would face, it was time to go right back to the drawing board and begin preparing for this weekend.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Stanford faced each other earlier this season in March, ending with the Cardinals prevailing with a crushing 16-5 victory over the Gauchos. While UCSB will enter Friday as the underdog against a powerhouse in Stanford, the Gauchos have shown resilience week after week, having endured just two losses since their loss to Stanford.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the greatest advantage that the Cardinals possess is their postseason experience. But the Gauchos remain determined to keep things afloat with their performance in the pool.</p>\n<p>“Nothing changes for us,” Kay explained. “We will be great competitor’s with the same mindset we had at Big West Championships. [We will continue to] focus on being present and pay attention to the little things.”</p>\n<p>Since the commencement of the NCAA Women’s Water Polo Championship back in 2001, Stanford is the only program to make an appearance every single year. This year, the Cardinals are on the hunt for their fifth national title in the past six seasons and what could be the sixth in program history. Stanford currently reigns as the national champions for the past two consecutive years.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara on the other hand has never been to the “Big Dance” before, but will be guided by the past playing experience of Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>As a four-season starter at UCLA, Coach Kay won three national championships from 1996-2000.</p>\n<p>“This is the same water polo game we have played all season, now we are all just dressed up like prom,” Kay said. “It is important to remember water polo is not rocket science – put the yellow ball in the back of their net and keep it out of ours.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that with Coach Kay in charge of the team anything can be accomplished. In only two short years at UCSB she has helped UCSB claim the Big West Tournament title for the first time ever and also became the first coach in program history to be named Big West Coach of the Year. Most notably, Kay is the first coach not from UC Irvine or Hawai’i to receive the honors.</p>\n<p>To add on to the list of records, this year five Gauchos were named to the All Big-West team, three of them to the First team.</p>\n<p>UCSB had just four other honorees over a span of seven years. The three players that received the First team accolades are the Gauchos’ group of seniors in center Lauren Martin, utility Samantha Murphy and goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson managed to move up from her honorable mention honor last season to Second team this year, and junior utility Taylor Shore received honorable mention for the first time.</p>\n<p>Helping guide Santa Barbara to its conference title victory was the outstanding play of Murphy, who was also named the tournament’s MVP after recording three hat tricks in three-straight matches and a record nine goals. She also finished second on the team with 72 points, 40 goals, 32 assists, and 36 steals.</p>\n<p>Not all her accomplishments are in the pool though. The San Jose native was recently named the 2015 Big West Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</p>\n<p>Another strong force in the paint for UCSB is a two time Big West Player of the Week recipient in Martin,who finished her senior season strong after coming off the bench. She led the team in scoring with a team-high of 49 goals and an impressive .505 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Complementing the Gauchos’ potent offense was their stout defense as well. Fortunately for the Gauchos,  they had Brokaw defending the cage. The fourth-year goalie registered 267 saves this season, 60 more than the second best finish on the team, averaging 8.9 per game.  Going into this weekend, she is only 10 short from moving up one spot to third on the All-Gaucho list.</p>\n<p>“I expect us to continue to ride the wave we are on – with a championship mindset, having each others back, and competing in every minute and every second of the game no matter what,” said Coach Kay on the team’s expectations this weekend.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will take place at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center beginning Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15. UCSB is set to face Stanford at 1:45 p.m.</p>\n<p>The winner of Friday’s match will advance to a Saturday semifinal against the victor of the tournament’s first game between UCLA and either UC San Diego or Whittier. Those two will meet in one play-in, while the other will pit San Diego State against Wagner.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 12, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/","id":4997,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4996,4995,4994],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Winners in Four Straight, Sweeps UCD & UCI Over Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winners in five of its last six matches, the UCSB women's volleyball team has now won four consecutive matches after defeating UC Davis and UC Irvine over the weekend.

Their .029 hitting percentage looked even worse against the Aggies’ .400 mark, and they would go on to lose by 10 points despite first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s four kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos got out to an early lead, a 6-1 Davis run would put the Gauchos in a 9-12 hole, and they weren’t able to close the gap under two for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>Facing an end to their recent hot streak, the Gauchos launched their comeback in the third set when an 8-9 deficit became a 16-9 lead, aided by seven straight Ruddins serves.</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Annie Hasselmann started the run with a kill on an assist by redshirt sophomore defensive specialist Sydney Bast, followed by senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Hasselmann contributing a block to further shift the tide.</p>\n<p>A Ruddins service ace pushed the lead to two, tying the second highest lead to that point in the set, and a kill from Elizabeth Sheffield resulted in a UC Davis timeout.</p>\n<p>They would find no help in the respite, however, as an attack error from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom, followed by two Ruddins service aces and another Sheffield kill, capped the stretch at 16-9 UCSB, a buffer that would extend throughout the set.</p>\n<p>UC Davis would not go down easily in the fourth set, as three kills from first-year outside hitter Lauren Matias contributed to a five-point run that would tie the game at 12.</p>\n<p>Despite the burst, UCSB would never trail again, as a continuous back-and-forth culminated with two kills from first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen and a 25-23 Gaucho victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB controlled the tiebreaker, hitting a whopping .538 and winning 15-6, as after the Aggies took a 2-0 lead to start, a 12-3 run by the Gauchos would essentially seal the match.</p>\n<p>The comeback from a two-set deficit was enabled by a career evening from outside hitter Chloe Allen, whose 19 kills, .394 hitting percentage, six digs and two block assists were massive for the Gauchos, especially as junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman went down with an injury in last week’s match against Cal Poly and was unable to play against Davis.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Elizabeth Sheffield were also both rocking on the offensive end with 16 and 14 kills respectively. Ruddins added three service aces as well as 10 digs to give herself a double-double, and Sheffield continued her consistent efficiency, hitting .481 on the night.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley led the match with 40 assists and completed a double-double of her own with 11 digs, extending her streak of outstanding play that has coincided with the Gauchos’ recent run.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had five players finish with at least eight kills, paced by senior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht with 11. Their setters, sophomore Maddie Merlino and senior Sophia Mar, combined for 43 assists, as the two setters’ attack potency was on full display Thursday night.</p>\n<p>UC Davis outside hitters first-year Lauren Matias and sophomore Emily Allen collected 11 digs each, completing double-doubles with their kills, and Sophia Mar’s 11 digs also gave her a double-double for the match.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match with UC Irvine was substantially less dramatic, exemplified by the Gauchos outhitting the Anteaters by at least .050 in each of the three sets.</p>\n<p>The first set was the match’s closest, as despite holding a three-to-four-point lead for the majority of the frame, the Anteaters were able to get a couple big scores and pull within two when faced with game point 24-20.</p>\n<p>An attack error on senior setter Shelley Anderson would seal their fate, however, as UC Irvine couldn’t capitalize on what would be their high watermark of the evening.</p>\n<p>The second and final sets would play out similarly to one another, as both began with decent competition between the two teams; they were tied at 11 in the second, and the Gauchos held an 11-10 run in the third.</p>\n<p>Massive runs in each game by the Gauchos would follow in each set, however, and neither featured any substantial late-set drama.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was huge for the Gauchos in this one, with 15 kills, eight service aces and nine digs, almost completing a triple-double. Megan Rice, Chloe Allen, Elizabeth Sheffield and senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt would all assist her offensively, chipping in at least seven kills apiece.</p>\n<p>Libero Emilia Petrachi turned in a brilliant performance with 20 digs (6.67 digs per set), and set the tone for what was an unstoppable Gaucho defense. Sheffield assisted in three blocks, and Hannah Juley and Sydney Bast added seven and 11 digs respectively.</p>\n<p>No one on UC Irvine was able to amass double-digit kills, though junior libero Luna Tsujimoto led the match with 22 digs.</p>\n<p>Setter Shelley Anderson was also potent for the Anteaters, her 27 assists a team high and second in the match only to UCSB’s Hannah Juley, who finished with 10 more.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and push their winning streak to five next weekend at home, with Friday and Saturday matches against Cal state Fullerton and UC Riverside, respectively. Both matches are at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/","id":4998,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4997,4996,4995],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
