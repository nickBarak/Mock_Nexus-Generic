The carnival has exponentially grown since its origin in 2012. Carnival-goers were surrounded by a plethora of activities including rides, games, and of course, live music. This year’s lineup was arguably the best yet, featuring an array of artists such as A$AP Rocky, Anderson .Paak, Erykah Badu, and Chance the Rapper. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The carnival took place over two days, both of which consisting of around 12 hours of quintessential festival activities. Primary artists performed on two stages: Camp stage and Flog stage, with various DJ’s operating the small central Gnaw stage. The carnival grounds featured three Ferris wheels, luminescent slides, as well as other classic carnival rides. Attendees were provided with a plethora of eating options ranging from chicken &amp; waffles to Action Bronson’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuck That’s Delicious</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Chinese takeout truck. Similarly, guests could take their chances at carnival games to possibly win Golf merchandise or visit A$AP Rocky’s retro video gaming tent. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74335\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1952015201\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74324\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74335\" data-attachment-id=\"74335\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/camp-flog-gnaw-festival-returns-to-l-a/unnamed-1-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?fit=743%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"743,743\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?fit=743%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-74335\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Maddy Judd / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-2.jpg?w=743&amp;ssl=1 743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74335\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maddy Judd / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day one was kicked off with a soulful performance by Phony Ppl, a Brooklyn-based band that exhibits a sound consisting of vintage funk, soul, R&amp;B, and hip-hop. Two hours after the group’s set, Kamasi Washington performed on the same stage. Washington’s set was packed with exhilarating and euphoric jazz instrumentation, highlighted by the breathtaking talent of his band. At 4:30 pm, LA producer, TOKiMONSTA, took the stage. By this point, the carnival was in full effect. Beach balls began to dance around the sun-saturated sky as TOKiMONSTA brought out two surprise guests: Isaiah Rashad and Joey Purp. Rashad’s appearance was still in the wake of hype surrounding his debut LP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sun’s Tirade</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Joey Purp boosted the crowd’s dynamism with a performance of his quirky single “Girls</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A highly anticipated performance of Flog Gnaw 2016 was that of the Grammy-nominated neo-soul group, The Internet. Following a brief technical delay, vocalist Syd tha Kyd exploded onto the stage as the band played their hit song “Get Away</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”  Tyler, The Creator made an appearance towards the end of the group’s set, then returned off stage to resume dancing. Chicago native Chance the Rapper followed with a mix of high-energy hip-hop and gospel-laced soul music complemented by exhilarating fire and spark displays onstage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A$AP Rocky had his own slot on Saturday. Rocky performed a variety of songs from old and recent projects, even bringing out fellow members of A$AP Mob such as A$AP Ferg and Twelvie. Rocky’s performance was a carnival favorite as he surfed the crowd and provoked mosh pits at various points throughout his show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler, The Creator kept the crowd on its toes by repeatedly switching from old to to new songs prematurely. In addition to his own tracks, Tyler brought out Rocky to perform “Telephone Calls,” a single from the recent A$AP Mob album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cozy Tapes: Vol. 1 Friends</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Lil’ Wayne capped off the night for the majority of attendees whilst Canadian producer KAYTRANADA headlined the smaller Flog stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than 12 hours after Wayne’s performance, doors opened for day two of Camp Flog Gnaw.  Sunday was equally as saturated with talent as the first. Vince Staples came out for Taco’s set to perform “Norf Norf.” Delirium 2016 acts Flatbush Zombies and YG both made appearances at the carnival following their UCSB Halloween special. After Flatbush was New York rapper [and chef] Action Bronson, who showered the crowd with culinary raps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Camp stage, Anderson .Paak and his band, The Free Nationals, continued to assert themselves as one of the country’s most exciting and energetic acts. Paak’s sexy, soul-inspired hip-hop and singing flooded the atmosphere of Exposition Park with funky beats and raspy hooks. Following Paak was the legendary Erykah Badu, one of Tyler’s life-long idols. Badu performed a culmination of songs, many of which derived from her critically acclaimed album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baduizm,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which turns 20 years old in 2017. Badu’s set began and ended approximately 30 minutes behind schedule; at this point, suspense surrounding the TBA slot in the festival’s lineup reached it’s peak. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previous surprise performers included artists like Kanye West, so expectations were quite high. The slot was initially rumored to be attributed to Frank Ocean, though many were either pleased or disappointed to discover that Earl Sweatshirt would actually be performing with his once-estranged friend, Tyler, The Creator, under the stage name of EarlWolf. The duo performed Odd Future classics such as “Orange Juice” and “Couch,” as well as solo work. Headlining day two was Schoolboy Q on the Camp stage and Death Grips on the Flog stage. As fans flooded Q’s show Tyler headed out to the carnival grounds to ride rides and take photos with fans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Tyler, The Creator exceeded the expectations of many music-lovers and critics and established his illustrious carnival as a staple of the West Coast festival scene. In a political and social climate like this, it’s delightful to see people of all kinds come together and collectively enjoy the creativity of others.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

We are facing an unprecedented amount of pressure right now, trying to figure out how the decisions made by us and for us will affect our futures. Politically charged music has been created throughout the years for this very reason and have consequentially become classic anthems of unrest. There is a new class of songs that have been created with the same purpose and carry the same weight that political songs of the past did for our parents.</p>\n<p>Baby Boomers gave way to Generation X, and Generation X gave way to Millennials. Each generation of young people comes with their own set of large-scale anxieties and therefore creates art to serve as both a response and a relic as time goes on. Younger generations do not only serve as tastemakers in culture, but they also have the power to completely shift the tide of politics. This is especially important in this election because Tuesday’s outcome does not only have obvious partisan and economic implications, but monumental cultural implications as well. We can confront this in the best way <em>we</em> know how: Let’s cling to our technology, put our earphones on and reflect on politically aware songs of the past and present.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol>\n<li>“Mr. November” by The National</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This song was written during the latter half of George W. Bush’s second term. The National seem to scrutinize career politicians like Bush: blue-blooded, Ivy League men who have consistently led our country. The titular “Mr. November” churns through an overwrought, aggressive internal monologue. “I won’t fuck us over, I’m Mr. November,” lead singer Matt Berninger sings in a way that strains his voice beyond comfort. The pressures leading the country pose to any potential leader are captured by the song’s pounding, kick-crash drums that carry the song’s angst to unfathomable heights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZjszc2YOAE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>“Young Americans” by David Bowie</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For clarification’s sake, Bowie was British in every single sense of the word. Even from the other side of the ocean, however, he was fascinated by our way of handling political unrest: specifically, the widespread uneasiness that characterized Nixon’s presidency and how young people acted upon the way they felt. This and Bowie’s use of elements from soul music of the ‘70s, characterized the album <em>Young Americans</em> as a whole. This song is upbeat, which makes it easier to find positivity in being unestablished but still in control of our futures.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSHY1_ux8rs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>“Fortunate Son” by Creedence Clearwater Revival</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a communication class I am taking this quarter, the professor screened an advertisement featuring this iconic track written by war veteran and lead singer of CCR, John Fogerty. It was an advertisement for jeans; denim as a symbol of classic American ideals is analogous to apple pie. However, the professor mentioned the irony of this song being used in the commercial as a positive representation of being an American citizen because it is a blatant criticism of young men being drafted for the Vietnam War. America, of course, is not currently under the threat of war, but it is important to remember that although for different reasons, young people in the ‘60s were facing just as much — if not more — discontent with our country as we are now.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ec0XKhAHR5I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>“Holy Shit” by Father John Misty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Singer-songwriter, amateur comedian and all-around magnetic persona Josh Tillman, also known as Father John Misty, is famous for his commentary on the state of love as it relates to everything. Whether it be religion, technology or politics, he glides through it all, acoustic guitar and silky voice softening his tongue-in-cheek criticisms. In this track from his sophomore effort <em>I Love You, Honeybear</em>, his disillusionment with the issues our country is constantly bombarded with is clear. He is a part of the group of people in the grey area between Generation X and Millennials, and his music reflects his uncertainty in his position. Tillman is well aware of how the problems we are facing are affecting us, but he is unsure of how to confront them.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TXdtZLrsZc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>“What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of the many stories I’ve heard from my mother about my great-grandfather, one of the fondest is her memory of this song by Marvin Gaye, his favorite classic soul track. My own memories of him are blurry because he passed away when I was young, but I can imagine him sitting at the kitchen table, shaking his head at all of the confusion going on in the world and tapping his cigarette into an ash tray. The finger snaps and doo-wop singing in the background of the record give it a pool hall feel, but it is instantly elevated by the impassioned lyrics and string orchestration in the foreground. This song, like “Fortunate Son,” is anti-Vietnam, but it is more of a plea than a protest. With the current state of conflict within this country, this would still be my grandfather’s favorite song if he were alive. Because certain tracks have a way of bridging gaps between multiple generations, it is just as relevant to me as it was to him.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-kA3UtBj4M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>“Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although Dylan is practically the father of musical activism, this track is not explicitly political. “The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,” he sings, as though he is soothing a crying child, and it is a sentiment which can quell the worry of almost any problem. Perhaps the most overwhelming emotion we are feeling this election season is uncertainty. No matter who you are voting for, the outcome this year is quite uncertain. But, in a way, it is comforting to know it is floating somewhere in the universe, and we will figure it out very soon.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vWwgrjjIMXA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

neck as he announced, “I’m just trying to get vibey.” The young man was DJ/producer Matt DiMona, the opening performer for Goldroom at the Hub. It was April 7, a Thursday night, and the venue was nowhere near its capacity. Nevertheless, DiMona proceeded to play his remix of Blackbear’s “90210.” There was a wave of head bobbing as the song played and the pace stayed moderate as he went on to play his song “I Just Want You.” After giving the crowd a taste of his own music, DiMona filled the venue with some nostalgic vibes as he played “Bartender” by T-Pain. Everyone sang along as the soulful jam boomed from the loudspeakers.</p>\n<p>After the R&amp;B hit was over, it was clear that everyone was ready for more. At this point what was once a room filled with a few heads bobbing back and forth was now one with the nightclub aesthetic. A slight pause went by, and the words “Your love is fadin’” filled the room as the song “Fade” by Kanye West came on. The audience rocked back and forth with intensity as the funky vibrations shook the room. Not only was DiMona able to make great use of one of West’s newest songs, but he also managed to resurrect the sensational music of R&amp;B artist Frank Ocean as he played his song “Lost.” The crowd yelled in agreement with the DiMona as he questioned “Yo, when is Frank Ocean going to drop that album though?!”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69887\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69887\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1782381608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69887\" data-attachment-id=\"69887\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=350%2C233&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,233\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69887\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As DiMona made subtle transitions between electronic and rock music — ranging from from Blood Orange to music with a much more house-like feel — the energy levels only became higher and more intense. It was clear that DiMona was feeling the liveliness of the crowd, seeing as he was jumping up and down and encouraging those around him to join him. Just as the crowd thought he was finished, the DJ yelled, “Yo, you guys down to listen to a song I’ve never performed before?” Of course, the audience yelled in excitement as his never before heard tune came on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was a bittersweet ending to an amazing set list, but the night was not over at the Hub. Goldroom had yet to reach the stage but everyone continued dancing, keeping the upbeat mood alive. The tone was set in stone as the Goldroom crew proceeded to set up their variety of instruments.</p>\n<p>There was a unique array of sounds infused throughout the venue as the six-person group began their set for the night. The musicians began the night by performing their song “Only You Can Show Me,” and as the audience engaged themselves in the sensational sounds that the tropical band had to offer, it was clear that the Gauchos were digging the music.</p>\n<p>“Her voice is crazy!” yelled one of the audience members in reference to the female vocalist. For a brief moment the singer stood in the middle of the stage, and as she sang “Till Sunrise” the melodious lyrics pierced through the crowd and echoed throughout the venue. Josh Legg, the mastermind behind the production and lyrics of the music Goldroom has to offer, has stated that he enjoys switching up the musicians for his live performances. It makes for a unique show with unpredictable outcomes seeing as everyone is artistic and skilled in their own way.</p>\n<p>Along with the beautiful vocals that Goldroom provided came the energetic instrumentals. From the drums, guitar, bass, keyboard and even the chimes, every instrument played a crucial role in the live performance. It was dance music with a serene and passionate feeling throughout the crowd. Although it was a bit awkward when Legg announced, “Find somebody to make out with,” as the song “Fifteen” came on, there was a sense of relief when Goldroom played what was deemed to be a new song called “Breaks.”</p>\n<p>“This song can be a break from anything, really.” Legg said, and it was just that: a break from reality.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, you guys are beautiful!” said Legg as he and the rest of the group made their way off the stage. However, that was not enough for the Gauchos on that Thursday night; they fiended for more, and as they yelled, “Encore!” over and over again, Goldroom came back to the stage to perform one last song for the deserving audience. In an interview a few days prior to the concert, Legg stated that a good crowd for him is one that is not “cool” but is willing to embrace the music, dance and have fun. That night, the Hub’s audience, without a doubt, met his expectations.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_69888\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69888\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"185469295\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69888\" data-attachment-id=\"69888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69888\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Vocalist Tyrone Lindqvist, keyboardist Jon George and drummer James Hunt find themselves on State Street April 20 to perform a sold-out show to their loving, supportive fans.</p>\n<p>The alternative dance group hails from Sydney, Australia, where their debut album <em>Atlas </em>topped the album charts at No. 1 in 2013, while their second album<em> Bloom </em>made its way to the top in 2016. Getting inspiration from other electronic dance and indie musicians and enthusiasts like Flume and Foals, <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>decided to shake up the basis of electronic dance music. By using real instruments in their music, the group has taken their artistic ability and authenticity to a whole new level. With mellow vocals combined with an upbeat rhythm, <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL</strong> is just one of the few acts changing the EDM genre.</p>\n<p>The “You Were Right” producers formed back in 2010 where they performed at house parties to crowds of about 50 people. It wasn’t until 2011 — when they released their first EP, <strong><em>RÜFÜS </em></strong><em>EP — </em>that things started changing<em>.</em> The group released four singles from <strong><em>RÜFÜS, </em></strong>all helping carve their path to success. <em>Atlas</em>, the group’s first full length album, scored the trio a chance to take their “Desert Night” tour to North America. Making stops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and New York, the tour marked great success for the three members. <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>was on the rage, and the trio kept trucking along until they found themselves playing at SxSw, where they blessed the hearts of hundreds of fans. The group has sure come a long way from performing to a crowd of 50 to performing to crowds of hundreds, sometimes even thousands of people in one night. At SxSw, they played three shows in one night alone.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nominated for six ARIA Music Awards, it wasn’t until the group’s 2015 Best Dance Release nomination when they were crowned the winner for their single “You Were Right.” <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>have fought their way into the mainstream and the battle has paid off. The trio continues their 2016 “Bloom” tour by playing week two of Coachella and then flying off to their home country for the Australian and New Zealand leg of their tour only to return to the states in June to play festivals like Firefly, Electric Forest, Lollapalooza and Outside Lands.</p>\n<p>Even with all the nominations and festivals the group hasn’t strayed from their humble beginnings. Being friends for years, the bands cohesiveness is very secure. They keep each other level when things get too overwhelming. The comradery shared between the three has resulted in fantastic live shows with an excess amount of vibrant energy. At only six years old, <strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL </strong>is knocking on the front door of every barrier and kicking them down.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69976\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/rufus-du-sol-making-soho-pit-stop/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69976\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/rufus-du-sol-making-soho-pit-stop/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/rufus-du-sol-making-soho-pit-stop/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/rufus-du-sol-making-soho-pit-stop/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/rufus-du-sol-making-soho-pit-stop/","id":6752,"author":{"id":720,"name":"Samantha Salazar"},"related":[6751,6750,6749],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
