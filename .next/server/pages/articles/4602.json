A California Highway Patrol car was parked on the side of the street, but Waltman didn’t think twice about breezing through the intersection on his bicycle.</p>\n<p>“There were no cars on the road and it was 9 a.m.,” said Waltman, a UCSB alumnus. “I slowed down and didn’t stop. I’ve done that plenty of times in front of a cop.”</p>\n<p>Moments later, the patrol car’s lights flashed on and an officer cited Waltman for failing to stop — a $270 fine for the first offense, according to the Santa Barbara Police Department.</p>\n<p>“‘We are cracking down on it to hopefully make you guys more safe,’” Waltman recalled the officer saying. As Waltman pedaled away from the curb, he saw the officer pull over another bicyclist for running the same stop sign.</p>\n<p>While Waltman and other Isla Vistans say there has been an increase in citations for bike offenses, Officer John Gutierrez of the Santa Barbara Police Department said there is no effort by highway patrol officers to write more tickets.</p>\n<p>“We’re not told to go out there and write up bicyclists — not at all,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>The police department will be hosting a bike safety event on March 2 at the Pardall Center, after which, Gutierrez said, there may be a “ramped up increase” in citations.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez pointed to recent bike accidents in I.V., including a two-bike collision on Pardall Road <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/692109191822049280\">in January</a> that sent one person to the hospital, as evidence of the need for bicyclists to follow traffic signs.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are riding bicycles unsafely in I.V.,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night, Associated Students senators voted to send a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bike-Law-Resolution.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> resolution</a> to External Affairs Committee that calls on campus police, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office and California Highway Patrol “to allow bicycles to treat stop signs and red lights as yield signs.” The resolution will now head to A.S. External Affairs.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Jerel Constantino, who drafted the bill, said because so many students already ignore the bike laws, the bill is designed “to keep the status quo.”</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, third-year history of public policy major and College of Letters &amp; Sciences collegiate senator, said Isla Vista Foot Patrol regulates bicycle and skateboard laws inconsistently.</p>\n<p>“The crackdown on bicyclists is unreasonable, because I.V.F.P. will be very strict on biking rules . . . and then will disappear,” Minoiefar said. “I don’t think the crackdown is about safety, because the rules are not enforced consistently.”</p>\n<p>The resolution refers to a 1982 Idaho statute known as the “Idaho stop,” which allows bicyclists to roll through stop signs, after looking both ways, and to bike under red lights after stopping.</p>\n<p>“The Idaho stop is not saying you see a stop sign and you ignore it,” Constantino said. “When you see a stop sign, that should be a key to look both left and right and, if necessary, stop.”</p>\n<p>Constantino, third-year history of public policy and political science double major, said he bikes to campus from I.V. every day and drafted the bill to protect bicyclists “from a misguided prioritization of law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls for the California State Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown to institute a similar law statewide.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Waltman was cited, he posted a picture of his ticket on a popular UCSB Facebook group, warning other bicyclists that officers were enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, he was at the center of a spirited debate in the comment section about whether police should ticket bicyclists for failing to obey traffic signs.</p>\n<p>While some commenters assumed Waltman disagreed with being cited, he said he “totally deserved” the ticket.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s a little inconvenient to stop and go on a rusty old mountain bike, but when you have a culture where nobody stops and people just throw themselves into intersections, it’s dangerous,” Waltman said.</p>\n<p>Elena Rovito, fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she often bikes to class and to restaurants in I.V. Rovito said she always follows the traffic signs, but when she walks, she has to be aware of bicyclists who are not following the law.</p>\n<p>“You have to constantly be on your toes,” Rovito said. “You’ll see people biking, not looking both ways, texting, and I’ve had to jump out of the way on more than one occasion.”</p>\n<p>Sarah Garrett, first-year political science major and copy reader at the Daily Nexus, was ticketed recently for failing to stop at the corner of Camino Pescadero and Trigo Road. Garrett said she plans to enroll in a bike safety course to reduce her fine.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think anything of it because, a couple days before, I had blown through a stop sign by a cop and nothing had happened,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>The officer told Garrett that he was trying to keep her and other bicyclists safe, but she said stopping at some intersections can be more dangerous than passing slowly through.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be more of a hazard to stop at certain stop signs because no one is stopping and I feel like herds of bikes might run over me,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>Garrett now tries to avoid biking through I.V. by staying on El Colegio Road for as long as possible. When she has to bike through I.V., though, she said she stops at every stop sign to avoid another ticket — or at least slows down and puts her foot on the ground.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this story said the bike resolution had passed Student Senate. The bike resolution was revised and sent to External Affairs, passed, and sent back to Senate where it awaits final approval.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Food Bank Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen said the purpose of the event was to help connect I.V. residents through healthy eating habits.</p>\n<p>“I think that if folks have the ability to begin to interact with their neighbors, and begin to really use and work with the other neighbors, there’s a lot of potential to really be able to capitalize on that social capital and really be able to support one another in some way or another, in genuine way of figuring out and caring for one another,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>The event drew a crowd of around 70 to 80 people, according to Nguyen.</p>\n<p>“We might have reached 100; I think there was a moment where it was pretty packed in here,” Nguyen said. “I think that [the Grazing Hour] has continued to grow and we hope that it continues to grow as folks are hanging out and chilling.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66475\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2124948698\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66513\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66475\" data-attachment-id=\"66475\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/iv-food-co-op-potluck_vivian-bui-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"530,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447432573\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Food Co Op Potluck\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66475\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=350%2C528\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66475\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Nguyen said she feels it is important for the Food Bank to reach out to the community.</p>\n<p>“We have engaged in some of these other activities in the community, just to kind of begin to engage folks in sharing food differently, and build some community beyond just our pantry,” Nguyen said. “So it was important for folks in our leadership to engage in something like this.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen also said she hopes The Grazing Hour created a welcoming environment which Isla Vistans may not often experience.</p>\n<p>“As we expand … even if this creates some sense for someone who just walked by, and who now is just coming in for and seeing this event happen, and they have that sense of community for this moment and for this month, ” Nguyen said. “Even if it’s once a month that they’re a part of something, it’s important.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Ariana Richmond said the event connected her to other people in I.V. in a “chill” way.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a great community feel, beautiful music, and food. You always meet nice people,” Richmond said. “The food was good, it was so healthy.”</p>\n<p>Cherland said he was invited to play at the potluck after requesting to play on KCSB.</p>\n<p>“I worked for Tuyen when I was a student at UCSB, and I recently reached out to KCSB to see if I could play on the air, and Tuyen was the one that picked up the request,” Cherland said. “So I got to play [at KCSB] on Tuesday, and she asked me to play this as well.”</p>\n<p>Cherland said he enjoys events such as the potluck because it is more relaxed than the I.V. party scene.</p>\n<p>“I like the idea of the community events, just because it’s calmer than a lot of the Isla Vista scenes, and as a freshman I would have liked to come to things like this, just where you can like chill out with your friends and relax,” Cherland said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Diego Rivera said his favorite part of the event was the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>“I really like the ambience, the mood; it’s really relaxed. I feel like everyone here is really chill,” Rivera said. “I enjoyed myself; this is definitely something I’d like to do again.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_66474\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66474\" data-attachment-id=\"66474\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/iv-food-co-op-potluck_vivian-bui-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"530,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447432457\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Food Co Op Potluck\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66474 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=530%2C800\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"530\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-66474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66513\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66513\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/","id":4601,"author":{"id":148,"name":"Jacob Little"},"related":[4600,4599,4598],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
