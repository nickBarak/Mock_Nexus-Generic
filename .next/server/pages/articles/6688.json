Stop on by. I’ll make you a cup of coffee. See you later.” These were the last words the world heard from Mac DeMarco’s until May 5’s new release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and, quite frankly, it’s a good thing that they didn’t stay his last words. This softened attempt at personalization fell drastically short for two reasons. Firstly, it ended an album that was painfully similar to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with maybe half of the redeeming qualities. Secondly, it came off as a desperate scream to the skies claiming DeMarco is the coolest cigarette-soaked indie rock hero that the world has ever seen. Simply put, he was trying too hard without a worthy result. Luckily for Mac and his fans, the dazzlingly subtle new project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solves both of these main issues. It not only showcases a new and alarmingly different acoustic style from the traditional Mac album, but it also shows our hero with a comfortable step back in his true element without the need to prove anything. After a respectable career of trying to articulate just how cool he is, DeMarco’s new evolved strength lies in his ability to simply sit back and relax. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to May 5, the traditional DeMarco album followed a very cohesive and strict formula. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another One</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all have their token upbeat retro guitar riffs, gradual winding waves and occasional emotional high-pitched synth. After repeated listens, it becomes easy to lose track of which songs are on which albums, as all three tend to blend into one big Mac DeMarco super-compilation. For example, “Ode to Viceroy,” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and “The Way You Love Her,” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another One</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could easily fit into sophomore project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as there seems to be very little variation in sound from 2012 to 2015. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> however, breaks the traditional Mac mold entirely as the project is mainly acoustic with a much more withheld and meditative energy. Rather than the dreamy electronic intricate guitar riffs that flooded his discography, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is more about the gentle movement of the chords. The approach is much more minimalistic as the rich and vibrant layers of the past have been reduced to a lighter and more fragile state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most effective illustration of this separation is the first single that was released from the album, the elegantly swaying “My Old Man.” Stuck on a loop of an acoustic guitar progression and a rudimentary electronic metronome in the background, Mac’s voice of nostalgia and growing up echoes with just the right balance of movement and relaxation. This formula is mimicked more as the album advances as many songs feature a single four-bar guitar loop, a drum beat and the light purr of DeMarco’s voice. Reminiscent of the speed of Real Estate and Wilco, DeMarco’s pace is never too slow to a point of boredom and moves only as fast as a light float down a river.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utdidBGSw5s?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=109&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac has also evolved greatly in his more developed and personal songwriting. It is clear that after a few years in the industry, and simply life in general, Mac is much more mature, wise and, for lack of a better word, old. His words now come from a place of reminiscence and honesty that can only come from a more worn and weathered place. The album opens with lead single “My Old Man,” which sweetly hums about growing older and seeing the resemblance of one’s parents in one’s self. The album comes full circle in the end with “Watching Him Fade Away,” as Mac describes his incomplete closure with his dad. He croons, “and even though we barely know each other, it still hurts watching him fade away.” These two alarming realizations of adulthood are exactly what the theme throughout the album conveys. It is gradual, bittersweet and painfully beautiful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac’s attitude toward love has evolved as well. Rather than his past approach of charming the listener into a false fantasy of love, here he has been through enough of it to have a better understanding. He sounds relaxed and satisfied with his loss on twinkling ballad “Still Beating,” when Mac expresses to a girl that “my heart still beats for you, even if you don’t feel it.” Here the longing has evolved from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> era, as not only is he finally addressing people directly and more honestly, but he has accepted the unrequited love in his maturity. Title track “This Old Dog,” feels the same way, as Mac sings out, “’Long as my heart’s beating in my chest, this old dog ain’t about to forget.” The honesty is much more apparent at this stage in his life, and we see Mac now attempting more to create an accurate message more than an impressive one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since he blew up in 2012, DeMarco has had the near perfect formula for becoming an indie rock icon. He made a song about obscure cigarettes, he wears red vans with white tube socks and he actively refuses to give a shit in most serious public contexts. His music was perfect, too. It was new and different and, above all, very very likeable. Mac has had a good spot in the industry for some time now and, quite frankly, he could have very well made another </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and gotten good reception, stayed right where he was. But the organic and more relatable approach to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows a change that had to happen not for the industry, but for himself. Here we are given the transition process from blissfully unaware youth to nurturing and observant adult. Although not always glorified by the young and electrifying indie rock scene, Mac is in a space of growth that, maybe especially for our college context, is extremely important.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77976\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77976\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/","id":6688,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6687,6686,6685],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales","biography":"Not available","articles":[5770,5788,6540,6607,6625,6638,6648,6652,6659,6688,6699,6702,6707,6744,6760,6765,6807],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Extravaganza ’17 Rocks the Masses","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite insistent cries from the audience, Schoolboy left the Extravaganza stage as he had found it, with no want for enthusiasm.

Silence rippled through Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78106\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1686027685\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78106\" data-attachment-id=\"78106\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3664-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3664\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78106 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Heralded by the furious pounding of her drummer’s set, Tinashe made her Extravaganza debut clad in an iconic military fatigue cap and backed by four dancers. The singer thanked UCSB profusely over an ocean of anxious noise before beginning with a rendition of her Schoolboy collab, “2 On.”</p>\n<p>SB was easily enthralled by the pop star’s performance. The force of her stage presence introduced an energy unlike anything UCSB’s concert scene has provided in the past year: the playful, in-your-face excitement of pop-diva stardom. All of her typical hits, including “Superlove,” “Flame” and “Company,” as well as songs off her 2016 studio album, <em>Nightride</em>, made appearances in Tinashe’s set. Longtime fans found no disappointment, while those unfamiliar with her work found enthusiasm in the vivacity of her act.</p>\n<p>Through her performance, Tinashe best connected with the crowd in a moment toward the end of her set. The line between the scheduled songs and the encore had blurred beyond haze-filled recognition, while the blaring brightness and scorch of the day drowned the better part of the crowd’s concentration. Tinashe finally paused. The singer visibly caught her breath as she addressed the crowd with “a special song, one close to my heart,” a song meant for all those who “understand why I’m here.” Channeling the anticipation felt in waiting on a lover, the performer had the crowd transfixed at the song’s opening line.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78107\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1361077705\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78107\" data-attachment-id=\"78107\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_2599/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_2599\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78107\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78107\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Tinashe at last completed her marathon, finishing her final song with a noticeable pant. She waved goodbye with a radiant smile, which electrically pulsated throughout the crowd. As her drummer’s no-holds-barred solo ushered her offstage, the pop star shouted one last thank-you to UCSB. With one last blown kiss, the once ecstatic stadium reverted to its strange liminal state of void noise.</p>\n<p>Tasked with picking up the quieted slack, Michigan-born electronica artist GRiZ snuck onstage to surprise the growing mass of college students. Reminiscent of RL Grime’s intensity, GRiZ’s set was much better suited for the outdoor air of UCSB’s signature nonchalant attitude. He recaptured the enthusiasm of the somewhat fizzled concert, becoming a stunning success from relative obscurity. GRiZ opened his set with some festive, chill swells. However, he quickly ascended into liveliness, invigorating Extravaganza with jazzy beats.</p>\n<p>GRiZ was accompanied onstage by his brass-playing companion, a trumpeter recalling the funky live sets of Big Gigantic. The Michigan performer himself wielded an impressive tenor sax. Yet the two musicians’ onstage vivacity was subdued by the striking quality of GRiZ’s visuals: a series of abstract animations reported to be of the artist’s own production. Images included a silhouetted head opening to release swirling streamers of color. Many were amazed by the unexpected detail of the set and the passionate simplicity of GRiZ’s performance. The duo brought an infusion of authentic excitement to a genre so unfamiliar with live instrumental performance.</p>\n<p>“The trumpet was <em>really</em> good,” screamed bubbly first-year Marissa Erese, “probably my favorite part.”</p>\n<p>GRiZ’s set offered some original work as well as mixes of well-received pop culture classics. The EDM artist raised Harder with a brass-infused performance of The Isley Brothers’ “Shout.” The chant of the song’s iconic lyrics resounded even when GRiZ turned the chorus momentarily off.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78108\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1767386801\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78108\" data-attachment-id=\"78108\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3035-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3035\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78108\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78108\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Again, the rush of sound and energy followed the performer off the stage. The babble of the crowd returned as concertgoers staked their claim on the floor or saddled for the arduous voyage to Harder’s rear in search of water. A stream of dead-eyed Extravaganzees could be seen clutching complementary water bottles as they queued at the cluster of administrative tents.</p>\n<p>Back onstage, in the heated haze of the festival’s waning hours, an enthusiastic, not entirely out-of-place twentysomething strode to the stage’s front.</p>\n<p>“Y’all need more energy before I can let Schoolboy come out here,” he taunted, priming the Extravaganza crowd for their headliner.</p>\n<p>Schoolboy Q entered Isla Vista with much anticipation. Sizing up the crowd with his characteristically smirky grin, Q yelled Extravaganza to life. Accusations of UCSB’s lacking level of energy prompted a fanatic series of screams from his audience.</p>\n<p>Extravaganza was only realized at the sound of the jingling opening of “Collard Greens.” The crowd chanted unanimously alongside the heavily panting rapper as a chasm of mosh enveloped the field’s center. Schoolboy ran through the list of his classic hits including “Studio” and “Break the Bank,” carried by the weight of his status as rap kingpin. The characteristic sharpness of his post-gangsta rap, South Central attitude shone in the casual nature of his crowd-mocking. Though rarely melodic, with discombobulated verses and a heavy dependence on freestyle, Schoolboy managed to provide a cohesive performance. The rapper’s set played well to Extravaganza’s atmosphere (contrary to the performer’s original beliefs), a release of scholastic pressure for a Sunday afternoon rush of music, raging and sweaty bodies. However, Schoolboy did incite some of his back-home, Flog-Gnaw rawness with the enormous mosh pit that slowly developed in the center of the field.</p>\n<p>Q paused to taunt the crowd, demanding everyone unready for part two of his performance, “Go back to your dorm rooms.” The rapper took his challenge a step further by denigrating the supposed lack of UCSB energy. “They were better at UCSD,” smirked the rapper. This served only to reinvigorate the crowd through chants of <em>olé, olé, olé, olé</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78109\" style=\"width: 1375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1140110231\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78109\" data-attachment-id=\"78109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3354-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3354\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78109\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1332\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Schoolboy finished with a performance of Kendrick’s “M.A.A.D.

Succumbing to the chants of “one more song,” Schoolboy riled the crowd with an improvised rendition of his most anticipated song, “THat Part.” Despite insistent cries from the audience, Schoolboy left the Extravaganza stage as he had found it, with no want for enthusiasm. The mass of concertgoers slid to the exits with the Santa Barbara sunset materializing over their exhausted heads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/","id":6685,"author":{"id":699,"name":"Daniel Gitlin"},"related":[6684,6683,6682],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Smino to Bring Soulful Sounds to the Hub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Smino-Graphic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Smino-Graphic.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The rapper’s words rebound off the bouncing melodies of each track in a way that keeps the album’s sonic momentum moving at a steady yet nonchalant pace.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>St. Louis rapper Smino is slated to perform in the Hub at UCSB on Thursday, Jan. 25 at 8 p.m. The artist has spent the past year touring with artists like T-Pain and Top Dawg Entertainment’s SZA in the wake of the release of his debut album, <em>blkswn.</em></p>\n<p>Over the years, the Hub has been host to numerous live outings at UCSB.

Smino has garnered attention from a handful of his contemporaries, even securing collaborations with artists such as Noname and Bari. At age 14, Smino met Bari, a local Missouri rapper, after it was suggested that the two collaborate together. Bari is featured on the track “Flea Flicka” on Smino’s debut LP.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Monte Booker is credited with the vast majority of production on <em>blkswn</em>, displaying his funky, bright style for the world to see. Since then, Booker and Smino have continued to collaborate on subsequent endeavors. American DJ Sango, who, like Booker, belongs to the Soulection record label, is also credited with production on numerous Smino projects.</p>\n<p><em>Blkswn </em>opens up with a smooth, sensual cut, “Wild Irish Roses,” which sets a warm tone for following tracks. Smino’s vocal performances and verses marry perfectly with Monte Booker’s production over the record. The rapper’s words rebound off the bouncing melodies of each track in a way that keeps the album’s sonic momentum moving at a steady yet nonchalant pace. “Glass Flows” has a flowery vocal feature from Ravyn Lenae that sounds entirely akin to its title: glassy and flowy. Some of my favorite tracks are found later on <em>blkswn</em>. “Netflix &amp; Dusse” and “Father Son, Holy Smoke” showcase some of Smino’s best lyrical and tactical abilities.</p>\n<p>Smino’s true musical prowess is exhibited on tracks like “Kolors,” which was featured on Soulection’s White Label record. On the track, the rapper weaves in and out of a variety of tones and volumes as he depicts a scene of himself dancing with a girl who was just heartbroken by a significant other, leaving her nestled within a mosaic of different feelings.</p>\n<p>Smino’s character is elevating. The artist is keen on promoting his community as well as the black community around the world, often speaking publicly about his experiences as a black man. His politics are progressive; he dismantles common conservative notions of gender and race in his music and interviews. On Real Late with Peter Rosenberg, the artist commented on derogatory figures in music who spread messages that are oppressive to particular groups and how he and his contemporaries combat those sentiments. “There are just a bunch of kids that are non-judgemental, period… It’s not even about the music. We’re humans out here. Anything you’re talking about, it’s cool,” he said.</p>\n<p>It is of my opinion that Smino’s character and music mutually enhance the quality of each other. The Hub will likely provide the artist with an intimate space in which he can share his thoughtful, eccentric personality and craft with fans.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

Though highly anticipated, the artist’s set provoked polarizing responses from attendees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ScHoolboy kicked off his performance with the track “Gangsta” from his 2014 LP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oxymoron</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The crowd collectively jumped in relief after a suspenseful intermission as Q infiltrated the stage. Midway through the track, ScHoolboy reached his microphone out toward the crowd, seemingly under the impression that the audience would recite lyrics back to him. </span></p>\n<p>Despite the artist’s expectations, the crowd didn’t reciprocate, and instead, ScHoolboy suffered an awkward lapse of silence. Q was visibly dissatisfied with this outcome, judging by the swift rate at which his facial expression and body movement fell flat. After closing the track out, the rapper expressed his feelings about UCSB’s presence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“UC Santa Barbara, what the fuck is up right now?” he exclaimed. “So look, I’mma let the record reflect right now, I done did mad college shows.

ScHoolboy Q is popular, but not necessarily a household name like his TDE counterpart Kendrick Lamar, for example. Most attendees didn’t know every lyric and detail of his music, and the event had elapsed for north of five hours prior to his set. Hence, a fatigued crowd is understandable, and an audience that lacks familiarity with the event’s headliner isn’t catastrophic. So, is ScHoolboy’s response justified? </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78109\" style=\"width: 1375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1913049339\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78143\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78109\" data-attachment-id=\"78109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3354-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3354\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78109\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1332\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought ScHoolboy Q was good because he tried to get us [the crowd] more involved when he saw that our involvement wasn’t at the level it could have been.” Carlos Ruvalcaba, a first-year Communication major on Q’s performance. Although some may have found ScHoolboy’s demeanor to be insulting, there are positive aspects at hand. </span></p>\n<p>His approach surely energized the crowd, at least to a degree. And at the end of the show the rapper expressed a change in opinion. Wrapping up the set, ScHoolboy gestured to the crowd and revised his previous position. “Yo, actually it wasn’t the worst college show I done, I done way worse than this. This shit was kind of fun.”</p>\n<p>His compliment, if one could call it that, was back-handed–but this is who ScHoolboy Q is. His behavior isn’t out of character, and it certainly plays into the persona that has been crafted over the artist’s career. That is, ScHoolboy Q portrays himself as gritty, intoxicated, and carefree. Perhaps the negative response he garnered derives from unfamiliarity with his persona, or maybe the artist is genuinely blunt to the extent at which it diminished the experience for those who attended the show.</p>\n<p>In any event, ScHoolboy Q’s polarizing performance, accompanied by a breadth of student reactions inarguably made for a provocative act at Extravaganza.
