Womyn’s Commission’s annual runway show will take place at the Corwin Pavilion this evening, as part of the group’s ongoing efforts to challenge societal beauty norms and represent the vast diversity of the campus.</p>\n<p>The ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show, which will be held at 5:30 p.m., will include live student-run performances of spoken word, in addition to a runway show and other acts open to student participation. The runway aspect of the event aims to shine light on body image topics that individuals in contemporary society oftentimes struggle with. Students can volunteer to participate in the runway to share their input on body image issues or to provide their own personal testimony. A.S. Womyn’s Commission hosts several events each year, all of which deal with various issues affecting women both on campus and in local communities.</p>\n<p>Kristina Didero, Womyn’s Commisson member and third-year sociology major, said the event will replicate mainstream runway shows but will include other aspects intended to make participants feel more comfortable.</p>\n<p>“It will be made to be as much like a real fashion show — where the model will have their picture taken at the end of the catwalk,” Didero said in an email. “Models are allowed to walk with other people as well, so those who don’t want to walk alone can still feel more comfortable participating in that portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>Popular modern media frequently emphasizes body image standards to an extent that has caused many to become “nit-picky” and “obsessive” with their own bodies, according to Didero, who said these individuals sometimes said never reach total satisfaction with their appearances. Didero said such an unhealthy dynamic should change, as it sets norms that make individuals practice excessive self-criticism.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the phrase ‘great body’ is never associated with anything other than the ideal 36-24-36 type for females,” Didero said in an email. “I personally feel like I don’t go a day without hearing multiple comments from various people criticizing their image and essentially indulging in negative self-talk. The conversation needs to change in terms of this topic, and the focus on appearance should be diminished.”</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan said the ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show will highlight the problems with standardized beauty, while drawing focus to the many different ways one can be beautiful. Agazaryan said discussion of this topic is especially crucial since the vast number of unhealthy living conditions, such as eating disorders, occur as a result of unfair beauty standards.</p>\n<p>“There is no one ideal type of beauty and what the media constantly displays isn’t the only kind of beauty,” Agazaryan said in an email. “We put on this event every year to raise awareness about beauty stigmas and eating disorders that arise as a result of this. Everyone is beautiful. We want to use the show to allow everyone the opportunity to be models to demonstrate what they believe is beauty.”</p>\n<p>Agazaryan said she believes that society’s definition of beauty is flawed as a result of fashion magazines and advertisements that promote unrealistic, and sometimes unhealthy, ideals of beauty.</p>\n<p>“Those ‘beautiful’ people we see are artificially created through Photoshop and digital media,” Agazaryan said in a email. “They don’t exist. I think that beauty is skin deep. I have met so many beautiful people that don’t necessary fit into the ‘standard’ of ‘beauty’ whom I believe are a hundred times more beautiful than what I see in magazines.”</p>\n<p>However, the examples set by these media outlets and advertisements can lead one to practice a sense of self-doubt and self-criticism that is difficult to escape, according to Agazaryan.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to ignore the issue of body image since it’s so internalized,” Agazaryan said. “Everyone at one point or another in their lives has questioned their body image. I, personally, still have issues with my body and it’s been so internalized that it’s difficult to shut it off sometimes.”</p>\n<p>Students can participate in the runway or sit in the audience members, and those interested in modeling can email Womyn’s Commission.</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Historian Olivia Jaffe-Pachuilo, second-year french major, said the campus organization is aiming to encourage self-confidence and appreciation for one’s body.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote body positivity and self-love,” Jaffe-Pachuilo said in an email. “Everyone deserves the right to feel beautiful in their own skin and their own bodies. Ideally, I hope that people would go away feeling empowered and more at peace with their bodies.”</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the May 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/a-s-commission-hosts-event-promoting-positive-self-image/","id":3119,"author":{"id":197,"name":"Shannon Ham"},"related":[3118,3117,3116],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":197,"name":"Shannon Ham","biography":"Not available","articles":[3119,3490],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Out With the Old, In With the New: 2013-14 A.S.

Their meeting lasted approximately two-and-a-half hours, with the longest discussion surrounding a debate over whether to approve the appointment of Aidan Brorsen to the position of chair of A.S. Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>Before officially swearing in the new senators, however, outgoing senators offered reflections on their terms and gave advice to the incoming team.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson said she urges new senators to strive for a productive term in office.</p>\n<p>“Don’t let yourself get to where we are right now. Don’t let yourself get to a year from now, and not feel like you’ve done anything on Senate,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Taryn Sanders stressed the importance of building relationships with fellow student policymakers outside of the Senate meetings, so as to maintain a healthy work environment. Sanders said fostering such bonds and friendships within A.S. can potentially help members during conflicts or issues.</p>\n<p>“Have parties together. Socialize together. Hang out together outside of Senate,” Sanders said. “Make some personal connections so that you aren’t yelling at someone in Senate that you hate because you don’t even know them.”</p>\n<p>According to Off-campus Senator Navkiran Kaur, the incoming Senate should strive to go beyond requirements detailed by the legal code and reach out to groups or communities who may not already have a presence on the Senate.</p>\n<p>“In your legal code, actually, it does state that you must go to organizations that you do not identify with — at least one meeting or event,” Kaur said. “I really, really, really do encourage that you do that extensively and beyond what your legal code dictates, making sure that you reach out to communities that you do not identify with, and that you are educating yourself and learning in this process as well.”</p>\n<p>Regarding the debate surrounding Brorsen’s appointment as chair of Committee on Committees, outgoing University Owned Senator Miya Sommers said she felt the appointment process lacked clarity.</p>\n<p>Sommers said she was unsure of why the opposing candidate Zach Goulhiane was not chosen during public forum and she questioned the basis behind Brorsen’s appointment.</p>\n<p>“I do not believe that he was accepted for his interview. I believe that he was accepted for external reasons,” Sommers said. “I think the external appointments need to be more closely looked at.”</p>\n<p>Newly sworn-in A.S. President Jonathan Abboud said Brorsen’s appointment over Goulhiane’s was due to the other candidate’s potential for placement in other A.S. positions.</p>\n<p>“Zach is being highly considered, basically selected, for other positions within the association,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>After much deliberation, the decision to confirm the appointment was tabled for one week, providing senators with more time to obtain information regarding each of the candidates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"580960544\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51570\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-2013-14-a-s-executive-officers-assume-roles/senate_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369269354\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51571\" alt=\"Senate_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Marisela Marquez addresses A.S.

Bike Committee is hosting Bike Safety Week from now until Friday, encouraging students to practice caution while riding through the sometimes-risky bike paths on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee will be tabling at the Arbor all week as well as passing out bike lights and surveys for students to improve their knowledge of bike safety. On Friday, the committee will hold a bike fix-it workshop with a mechanic from the A.S. Bike Shop, allowing local cyclists to learn repair skills and other useful biking knowledge.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee works all year to improve the biking climate of UCSB, with current plans to launch renovations to the bike racks at the Music Building, Humanities and Social Sciences Building and the University Center, in addition to a long-term plan to implement a new roundabout path near the tunnel located by the Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Mac Kennedy, maintaining the quality of the bike culture at UCSB — which is ranked second only to Stanford as the most ‘bike-friendly’ university nationwide — is a top priority for students.</p>\n<p>“Bike culture is, in my opinion, one of the integral parts of the UCSB student experience,” Kennedy said. “Currently, UCSB is ranked as the second-most bike-friendly university … and we think we can be the best.”</p>\n<p>Bike Committee Chair Emily Littleworth said although she does not believe the biking climate at UCSB is particularly dangerous, it can be daunting for incoming students.</p>\n<p>“If you haven’t biked at UCSB, and you come here for the first time, and you see all the students, it can be overwhelming,” Littleworth said. “I think it takes some practice learning how to ride on the bike paths, learning regular traffic laws that people should abide to.”</p>\n<p>Littleworth said Bike Committee aims to reduce the danger by both improving cycling infrastructure and educating the community on safe biking tips.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bike Committee is basically devoted to improving the bicycle system on campus at UCSB,” Littleworth said. “We do things ranging from basic improvements on bike paths, to putting in new racks, to putting in bike pumps around campus.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he hopes to reach out to a larger number of students in the future, as a means of expanding and strengthening the committee.</p>\n<p>“One thing I’m working on for next year is trying to get more general members involved,” Kennedy said. “Because I think we need to democratize the whole process and expand the committee.”</p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/","id":3117,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3116,3115,3114],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Kennedy, a second-year political science major, who served as an On-campus Senator until his resignation in January, is an independent candidate.</p>\n<p>Foronda said she aims to use her student body government experience to engage and empower students if elected.</p>\n<p>“I have been involved with Associated Students since my first year,” Foronda said. “I am here today not only to run as AS president, but to represent you as a student body and the student voices that have otherwise been silenced.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he would continue to make real changes on campus as A.S. President in addition to the reforms he has already implemented as RHA President.</p>\n<p>“I love UCSB. Since the first day I stepped on this campus I fell in love with this campus,” Abboud said. “I have implemented real changes on this campus … [like] take out boxes in the dining commons. The Office of the President will allow me to implement even more direct change to this campus”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said substantive reform is necessary to make the association more fiscally efficiently and criticized A.S.’s excessive spending of student’s money on honoraria — particularly on salaries for Executive candidates.</p>\n<p>“I’m running because I’m passionate about making this campus a better place for all students,” Kennedy said. “There needs to be several structural reforms in A.S. Currently, tens of thousands of dollars aren’t going back to the students, and are being pocketed by A.S. executives.”</p>\n<p>Foronda focused on the rising cost of tuition as the chief monetary concern for students, and said it is crucial to encourage students to participate in rallies, lobby legislators and generally voice concerns about the issue.</p>\n<p>“Tuition has risen over 300 percent in the last 10 years,” Foronda said. “Student voices have not been heard … I will be there, and I have been there … representing student voices.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, his goal is to continue keeping students constantly involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We can’t get caught up in the jargon,” Abboud said. “As RHA president, and as A.S. senator … I’ve done a really good job connecting with students. A.S. was created for and by the students and we have the right to keep A.S. … related to the students.”</p>\n<p>Addressing the subject of student apathy, Kennedy said the fault lies not with the general student population, but with their student government representatives who have failed to successfully engage them.</p>\n<p>“Disconnect is a huge problem between A.S. and the student body,” Kennedy said. “Students have not been engaged at all whatsoever in A.S. …where is the outreach? Where is the engagement? … I hope that in the future as I have done to continue the work in engaging students … making sure students are aware that they have agency, that they have power.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1172887416\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50825\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50819\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/calpirg-protests-obamas-potential-student-loan-interest-rate-hike/debate_filephoto/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPod touch\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365682595\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"3.3\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50819\" alt=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>DAILY NEXUS FILE PHOTO</h6>\n<h6>On Wednesday night, A.S.
