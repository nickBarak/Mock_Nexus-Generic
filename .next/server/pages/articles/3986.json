Finance and Business Committee (F&amp;B) met in the State Street Room of the UCen on Monday to approve funding requests for 12 campus groups and discuss two internal bills.</p>\n<p>The current budget stands at $57,198.05 in Office Student Life (OSL), $8,665.26 in Senate Unallocated, $ 45,000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP), $45,000 in Culture and Graduation, $30,000 in Sports Teams and $17,164 in Academic Teams.</p>\n<p>Fully funded groups included Active Minds for $1,802 in travel and hotel expenses for an organization conference, Gamma Phi Beta sorority for $1,770 for Crescent Classic Pancake Breakfast event, Pi Beta Phi sorority for $1,989 for Air Jam Dance Marathon, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) for $1,901 for a FBLA conference, Black Quare for $3,000 for Trans Revolution talk series and Surf Team for $3,000 in annual team costs.</p>\n<p>Partially funded groups included Zeta Phi Rho fraternity for $320 of $370 for a haunted house with Isla Vista Youth Projects, Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority for $735 of $835 for Kappa Dash 5K Color Run, International Student Association for $470 of $670 for ‘Go’ board game night and mixer and Hermanos Unidos for $1307 of $1370 for a community Thanksgiving dinner.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club’s request of $1,000 in furnishing for annual Beach Ball dance competition was tabled until the group finds additional sources of funding and furniture rental.</p>\n<p>Philanthropy Chair of Kappa Kappa Gamma and fourth-year communication and global studies double major Maggie Vlaco said the sorority will donate all proceeds from Kappa Dash 5K Color Run to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer research foundation.</p>\n<p>“We started this 10 to 15 years ago because one of our members passed away from ovarian cancer while attending UCSB, so it’s in memoriam of her,” Vlaco said. “We had over 300 participants last year and we raised over $5,000.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Susana Abdurahman said bringing transgender activist Cece McDonald to the Trans Revolution series at UCSB is extremely significant to the queer community because McDonald is a black transgender woman who was imprisoned in a men’s prison after defending herself from a racist and transphobic attack.</p>\n<p>“By defending herself, the man who attacked her was killed, and she was put in a men’s prison for 19 months,” Abdurahman said. “We are really excited to bring someone who has been a phenomenal activist for black and trans rights to come have a conversation with us about prison reform.”</p>\n<p>Co-captain of UCSB Surf Team and second-year pre-communication major Stephanie Schechter said because the team does not receive sufficient funding from the university, individual athletes must pay registration fees for the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA).</p>\n<p>“We have 14 national titles, but unfortunately we don’t receive very much funding or donations,” Schechter said. “Our team has to pay our own travel expenses. Our yearly costs are about $14,820, so we are requesting registration funds for NSSA.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds Co-Publicity Chair and Co-Events Chair Marisa Jones said it is an honor for UCSB representatives to speak at the national conference, which will focus on the organization’s goal of eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a five-star chapter at UCSB for six years in a row,” Jones said. “Only a few chapters have been able to speak, so we’re excited to be able to represent UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65285\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"718504292\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65328\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65285\" data-attachment-id=\"65285\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/finance-and-business_-by-oliver-zuniga-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444626351\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"53\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance and Business_ by Oliver Zuniga-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65285\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) collegiate senator and third-year CCS biochemistry and bioengineering major Dustin Larrazolo motioned a discussion about funding for Greek organizations, saying there should be a lower funding limit for Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic events.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that all IFC or Pan groups are one entity, but I don’t think Greek organizations should be getting these blank checks,” Larrazolo said. “I also believe this is a conflict of interest because there are IFC members here. It doesn’t seem entirely appropriate; if we do fund [Greek organizations] there should be a smaller cap.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo also said A.S funds should be reserved for students who require funding to attend the university.</p>\n<p>“I think these funds should be going toward students of color, undocumented students, students who require resources to continue attending the university as opposed to building up haunted house for I.V. Youth,” Larrazolo said. “I think that’s great, but it’s not our job to be a sponsor.”</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer of F&amp;B Kevin Koo said he does not oppose the allocation of funds to Greek organizations because they comprise a large portion of the student population.</p>\n<p>“They are accessing a lot of students and they are raising a lot of money. It’s beneficial for the community and the school,” Koo said. “I think the bigger issue is if philanthropies fall within our guidelines — if they do, I don’t see a problem with that.”</p>\n<p>Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez told F&amp;B about A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal’s plans to reallocate $9,000 from the A.S. Leadership fund to use for professional development.</p>\n<p>Senator Larrazolo also introduced a Bill to Redefine the A.S. Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital Fund (S.T.A.R.K.), amending the bill to allocate $4,000 dollars to the CCS student council and $4,000 dollars to the College of Engineering student council. According to Larrazolo, the current S.T.A.R.K. fund is meant to stimulate science research but is generally discussed in A.S. senate meetings rather than made accessible to CCS and the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“I can’t speak for the College of Engineering, but through CCS we require students to participate at a quarterly symposium at CCS,” Larrazolo said. “When someone receives funding we want to make sure they’ve actually made progress and [are] completing their mission statement.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65328\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65328\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/","id":3986,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3985,3984,3983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Alum Donates Book Earnings to Woolsey Fire Victims","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-11-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":" UC Santa Barbara alumnus J.D.

Slajchert</em></p></div>\n<p>At age 24, Slajchert has accomplished a lot.</p>\n<p>Last spring, he graduated from UCSB with a degree in sociology. During his time here, he was a member of the men’s basketball team for four years.</p>\n<p>Most recently, he authored a novel entitled <i>MoonFlower, </i>a coming-of-age book that draws on Slajchert’s real-life experiences, including dealing with the loss of his best friend, Luc Bodden, who Slajchert met when he was 17.</p>\n<p>Growing up in Oak Park, Calif., Slajchert was one of the stars of the Oak Park High School basketball team. It would be there where Slajchert would soon meet Bodden, a six-year-old with sickle cell disease.</p>\n<p>“I remember him coming up to me saying he was so happy to meet me, and he wanted to play basketball with me, and I just knew I had to do it,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>What Slajchert did not know at the time was that one of Bodden’s last wishes before heading into a year of isolation for a bone marrow transplant was to play basketball with him.</p>\n<p>From there, Slajchert’s relationship would continue to grow as he would visit his best friend from behind a glass wall. Something Slajchert remembers vividly from that time is seeing two pictures above Bodden’s hospital bed, one of him and one of Matt Kemp, a star baseball player most notably known for his time with the Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>\n<p>Slajchert said that moment put it in perspective how much Bodden viewed him as a hero.</p>\n<p>“I was only 17 when I saw that, and to see that Luc felt like I was just as famous as Matt Kemp was amazing,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, after four years of being best friends, Slajchert had to say goodbye as Bodden passed away in 2016 at the age of 10.</p>\n<p>Writing <i>MoonFlower</i> was one of the ways Slajchert was able to cope with the loss of his best friend. The very first page of the book is dedicated to Bodden with a phrase that says, “Smile more,” one of the last things Slajchert remembers his friend telling him.</p>\n<p>After beginning to write the novel on June 30, 2016, Slajchert finally saw one of his dreams come true as on Oct. 14 of this year the book was published.Then, just a few weeks later, on Nov. 9 the fires starting hitting Slajchert’s area of Oak Park. He and his family were forced to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“We really had no place to go. I had to call my mom and ask where to go, and she told all of us to pack up and head to Malibu. At the time it was a much safer environment, and we thought it would be all good there,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>One day later, the fire would jump the 101 Freeway and make its way towards Malibu.</p>\n<p>“At the time, I was afraid I was going to lose both houses I grew up in because I had no idea what was going to happen,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>After safely evacuating once again, this time from his mother’s house, Slajchert turned on the news. Hoping for the best, Slajchert did get some good news as his house at Oak Park was safe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the same could not be said for his house in Malibu.</p>\n<p>“As I was sitting there with my mom watching the news, we saw our actual house go up in flames. My mom just kept shaking me, saying ‘J.D., that’s our house.’” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>“I tried to calm her down but it was extremely difficult for both of us. To have to watch our house on the news just go up in flames was horrific. It was one of the lowest points of my life.”</p>\n<p>Slajchert was devastated. A house he grew up in was gone in an instant.</p>\n<p>One of the things that kept coming to Slajchert’s mind was his friend, Ahrya, who had recently taken a trip to Jamaica. Once Ahrya arrived, he realized he had forgotten his debit card and only had about $100.</p>\n<p>Forced to eat minimally, Ahrya was struggling until he received support from a local woman who invited him to eat with her and her family.</p>\n<p>Once there, Ahrya asked what the woman and her family was doing at a hostel instead of their home. The woman informed him that their house had burned down and they had nowhere else to go just as she was handing Ahrya the food.</p>\n<p>After hearing that, Ahrya could not accept, but the woman kept pleading with him to please take it. After finally agreeing, Ahrya asked just one question: Why was she so quick to help him, a stranger, when her life was in shambles?</p>\n<p>The woman responded by simply saying that they had to share, that they wanted to give back. That story, along with Bodden, kept replaying in Slajchert’s head. Then, he finally made a decision.</p>\n<p>After seeing his house go up in flames, Slajchert decided he was going to donate 100 percent of his book’s earnings to those affected by the Woolsey and Hill fires in a movement he titled #MoonFlowers4Malibu.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people assume you have to have a lot of wealth or popularity to give back to others, but I don’t think that’s the case,” Slajchert said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like even though I am only 24 and this money could help me get my life started in a lot of different ways, I would rather donate it to those who need it more than me,” he said. “My family and I will be fine, we will figure it out, but there are a lot of people who cannot say the same, so this is my way [of] sharing and my way to keep pushing this message forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Slajchert, 50 percent of the book’s earnings from Nov. 11 onward will be donated to the American Red Cross until Slajchert’s reaches his goal of $15,000. The other 50 percent will be donated to people who were directly affected.</p>\n<p>Since starting the campaign, Slajchert has met with many people. He says while it sometimes becomes overwhelming because there are so many people who need help, what makes the process gratifying is “how selfless some of these people are.”</p>\n<p>Slajchert has said that many times people will meet with him not in hopes of getting help for themselves, but for their own friends that need it more than they do.</p>\n<p>“I would say that every person I have met with has referred me to five more people that need help more than them,” he said. “To me, it just shows the strength of the community.”</p>\n<p>To this day, <i>MoonFlower</i> continues to help Slajchert cope with tragedy.

Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) plans to reach this goal by developing an eco-friendly fleet of zero-emissions buses powered by renewable energy, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The district hopes this move will reflect its efforts to support climate change solutions.</p>\n<p>SBMTD has a history of leading the way in environmentally-friendly transportation, said Hillary Blackerby, SBMTD interim planning and marketing manager, in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>SBMTD implemented the first electric buses in the U.S. into its fleet in 1991. Today, they have the second largest number of active electric buses out of any transit system in California, the press release stated.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to making this happen,” Jerry Estrada, SBMTD general manager, said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“The whole team at Santa Barbara MTD is proud of our pioneering work in battery-electric transit, and we look forward to continuing to lead the industry towards a zero-emissions future.”</p>\n<p>The cost of this transition is unknown, as bus prices tend to fluctuate significantly with the market, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>SBMTD recently purchased 14 new 30-foot electric buses, costing $380,000 per bus, she said. The 30-foot buses are used for shuttle service in Santa Barbara; however, for downtown, waterfront and crosstown shuttle, Blackerby projects they would need 40 to 60-foot buses.</p>\n<p>The latter would likely have steeper costs.</p>\n<p>The zero-emissions project will be financed by a combination of funding from the Federal Transit Association, state funding and other grants, Blackerby said. The transition to zero-emission buses will take place as the current buses reach the end of their useful life.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the California Air Resources Board – an organization dedicated to maintaining healthy air quality – is expected to adopt new statewide clean air standards in 2019 which would gradually phase in requirements for public transit agencies to purchase only zero-emission buses over the next few decades.</p>\n<p>These expectations will be met by SBMTD before the new standard is implemented, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>“By setting this goal, MTD can plan this transition, build the necessary charging infrastructure, send a market signal to bus manufacturers, and set Santa Barbara on the path to 100% clean, quiet electric buses powered by 100% renewable energy,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>The transition to zero-emission buses was also due in part to community organizations, including the Community Environmental Council and the local chapter of the Sierra Club. The groups worked to garner support for the plan from other community groups and individuals, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>SBMTD Board Chair Dave Davis said fulfilling the transition will be challenging, but feasible with help from local partners and the transit industry.</p>\n<p>“The MTD Board of Directors knows that it is the right thing to do for our agency, our community, and our planet,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Senate Monday, opening an on-campus senator positon.</p>\n<p>Wright is currently studying abroad at Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London and has been participating in Senate through a proxy, second-year computer science and statistics double major Tarush Mohanti. Although she has resigned as senator, Wright plans to continue as UC Student Association Alumni Relations Officer, the Michael D. Young intern to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and a member of the Working Group for the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault.</p>\n<p>Wright said the limits on the role she could play as senator while studying abroad contributed to her resignation.</p>\n<p>“Within my own projects, Tarush was coordinating with me so I could work on most of them remotely,” Wright said. “But I found out that I was not going to be allowed to submit legislation through him while I am abroad, essentially preventing me from doing any work while I’m away and negating all the work we had been doing, which I felt was unfair to the student body.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S operates as a “huge bureaucracy” whose policies inhibit with progresses.</p>\n<p>“All of its rules and regulations, instead of making it easier to facilitate work, have fostered a system of inefficiency,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>According to Wright, Senate members demonstrated patterns of behavior that “perpetuate discrimination, pre-conceived bias and downright hostility.”</p>\n<p>“Personally, I’ve consistently had my motives questioned, particularly from people who assumed I made my relationship choices based on my professional aspirations,” Wright said. “So often mental health and well-being of students is disregarded, which is horrible to see from an organization that promotes mental health reform and de-stigmatization.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S.’s “competitive environment” was one reason she chose to resign.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is filled with so many amazing and passionate people with the best of intentions,” Wright said. “However, in executing projects, many people — not all, but many — often can become territorial over their projects both to retain control over it but also to garner the most credit.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science double major and on-campus senator Nawar Nemeh said he agrees the Senate environment is one of unproductive competition.</p>\n<p>“Her resignation saddens me deeply but I understand it,” Nemeh said. “There’s a lot of cynicism about the intentions of others. I fear that this makes it harder for some people to get their reforms through.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he wants to solve the issues that drove Wright to resign by collaborating with other senators and being accessible to campus organizations.<br>\n“I am going to start reaching out to more senators I don’t usually work with and be a resource for people who need it,” Nemeh said.<br>\nWright said her “proudest accomplishments” at UCSB happened before her term as senator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gotten UCSB Campus Regulation changed to be fairer to [sexual assault] survivors, I’ve garnered over a thousand signatures for a petition to the Regents’ requesting additional funding for consent programs and helped organize over a dozen lobby visits,” Wright said. “I found Senate a more difficult environment to complete my projects in.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/","id":3985,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[3984,3983,3982],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
