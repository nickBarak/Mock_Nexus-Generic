Bush’s declaration of a “war on terror” by showing an increased interest in studying abroad.</p>\n<p>According to Juan Campo, the UCSB Education Abroad Program director, this year’s increase in applicants to EAP programs around the world is related to controversy surrounding the new administration’s policies, mirroring the surge in applicants in the aftermath of 9/11.</p>\n<p>While there are currently no EAP programs in the six countries under Trump’s Middle East travel ban, Jordan is a popular location for students interested in studying in the region because of its central location and reputation as a reasonably stable nation.</p>\n<p>According to Campo, more UCSB students applied to the EAP programs in Jordan than ever before, with an increase from three applicants for the 2016-17 school year to 13 for the 2017-18 school year.</p>\n<p>“Our enrollments are up over last year, and I am not surprised,” Campo said. “[After 9/11] people were saying, ‘Oh, it’s going to go down,’ but no, because it may cause students to want to become more engaged with the world.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what’s happening now … It’s really heartening to see that and looking system-wide they have a higher number of applications at this time than they had last year at this time,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President has not yet determined if the drop in applicants of 1.2 percent at Berkeley and 2.2 percent at Riverside is linked to the national phenomenon, as official enrollment figures will be released later in April.</p>\n<p>Lisa Przekop, UCSB director of admissions, said it is difficult to determine whether the university’s international applicant numbers will be similarly affected in the coming years. She acknowledged that the current political climate in the U.S. is a legitimate concern for students abroad.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that we continue to communicate honestly with prospective students so we can address their concerns honestly, dispel inaccurate rumors, and show them that UCSB is a friendly community with esteemed faculty and talented students,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Przekop said the close proximity of the application deadline to the presidential election likely influenced students’ decision whether or not to apply to the UC.</p>\n<p>“There was election coverage that didn’t always show the U.S. as being welcoming to international guests,” Przekop said in an email. “Students abroad pay very close attention to what is happening politically in the U.S. and I’m certain that this played at least a small role in UC application numbers from international students.”</p>\n<p>Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student at UCSB, said his peers in Iran have certainly been discouraged from studying in the U.S. since the implementation of the travel ban.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the increasingly challenging process of obtaining a student visa, not the political tensions arising in the early months of the Trump administration, is the major deterrent for students debating whether to study in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day if they need to get the admission letter, clearance, background check, it takes a long time. I have a lot of friends they just gave up and they went to Canada,” Golkaram said.<br>\n“Right now, I have been talking to a lot of friends, and they don’t even think about applying to the United States anymore because they know how hard it will be for them to go through this whole process,” he said.</p>\n<p>Golkaram added that single-entry visas typically administered to international students make travel outside the U.S. nearly impossible, and he hasn’t left the U.S. for three years because he fears he may not secure a visa again.</p>\n<p>“I would rather not leave the United States at all, which means I’m not going to see my country again for a long time,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the inability to travel outside of the U.S. proves especially challenging for graduate students, who are often expected to attend conferences abroad.</p>\n<p>Simran Singh, director of the Office of International Student Services, said while the current political climate is likely a concern for international students, as well as for their parents, the more common barrier is posed by the complications in obtaining a visa.</p>\n<p>Though the recent five percent increase in UC tuition for non-California residents brought the total cost to $41,964, Singh said she believes the tuition hike is not a likely contributing factor to the decrease in international applicants.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the socioeconomic background of the students who are coming here, they really come from wealthy families and I don’t think that’s a deterrent per se,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has yet to see a decrease in international applicants, Singh said, it is important for all departments on campus to make them feel safe and promote a reputation that the UC is equipped with the proper infrastructure to support traveling scholars.</p>\n<p>“We are talked about as a world class research institution and what they really bring is the diversity,” Singh said. “These students bring so much of themselves when they come into our countries and into our institutions. We learn from them as much as they learn from us.”</p>\n<p>Campo said the nationwide decrease in international applicants is very understandable “given the chaos” surrounding the implementation of the travel ban and the university should be taking concrete steps to ensure international students are not “affected adversely” by policies emerging from the Trump White House.</p>\n<p>“The university has to affirm its place, not as a safe zone so much, but as a forum for bringing these issues to the surface and taking a clear stand on how a civil society remains open and tolerant to different points and perspectives to prevent people from being victims of racial violence or xenophobic or religious bias,” Campo said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 6,

in Corwin Pavilion on May 10.</p>\n<p>The resolution, sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine members Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema, called for the university to divest from companies such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett-Packard, which allegedly perpetuate human rights abuses of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>A resolution to divest was first proposed at UCSB in 2013 and has now failed to pass four times.</p>\n<p>Eight other UC campus student governments have voted to divest, including Berkeley, San Diego, Riverside, Irvine, Merced, Los Angeles, Davis and Santa Cruz. No UC campus, however, has actually divested.</p>\n<p>The first divestment resolution was proposed at UC Berkeley in 2010, where it passed through the student government but was later vetoed by then-student president Will Smelko. The latest resolution passed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Some divestment resolutions, however, have faced further challenges. A UC Santa Cruz divestment resolution passed through its student government in May 2014 but was almost recalled in 2015 due to concerns about the original voting process.  At UC Davis, a resolution to divest passed in January 2015 but was recalled in February 2015 by the student court.</p>\n<p>The UC Board of Regents released its “Principles of Intolerance” last year, a statement condemning anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism on UC campuses. In 2010, the Regents’ chairman, vice chairman and UC president released a statement saying they will not divest until the U.S. government declares that the foreign nation is “committing acts of genocide.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was allegedly the last of the UCs to vote in 1978 to divest from companies with business ties in South Africa during apartheid. The UC Regents voted to divest from the corporations in 1986.</p>\n<p>Kaur, a fourth-year sociology major, said she sees similarities in the South African divestment history and the current debate with Israel and Palestine.</p>\n<p>“For the fourth time in a row … UCSB is on the wrong side of history,” Kaur said. “I think that consistently UCSB’s Associated Students is choosing to remain complacent and complicit in violence.”</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman of the Santa Barbara Hillel said the Israel-Palestine conflict is a “complex situation” and said he commends the Senate for “not following the path” of other student senates to vote to divest.</p>\n<p>Goodman said, however, that the eight other UC student governments that voted to divest are not representative of the current student bodies of those campuses because students, interests and motivations have changed since they voted to divest.</p>\n<p>“It’s a misnomer to say that all are voting to divest,” Goodman said. “They have each voted at a moment in time to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to Hillel International, UCSB has a current Jewish population of 2,850 students or 14 percent. This number is higher than on any other UC campus.</p>\n<p>Goodman said the large Jewish community at UCSB is a bonded group, and he cited the “UCSB Jewish Student Organizations’ Unified Opposition to BDS” unity letter as a sign of the collective efforts and ideals of the Jewish student population.</p>\n<p>Eight Jewish student organizations signed and released the letter last week in response to the divestment resolution and the Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.</p>\n<p>“Judaism is much more than a religion; it is a people,” Goodman said. “Israel plays an important role in the sense of Jewish peoplehood.”</p>\n<p>Kaur said she believes the resolution did not pass because there is a “lack of diversity” on Senate that she claims is due to the one-party dominance in A.S. elections. She said this results in similar ideologies running across the whole Senate.</p>\n<p>“We consistently see just one party sweeping our election,” Kaur said. “You can’t have a real democracy when it’s always one party that has the monopoly.”</p>\n<p>Despite supporting opposite positions of the divestment debate, Kaur and Goodman both said they believe students need to fully educate themselves about the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<p>“There is a genuine [and] deep lack of understanding of what this divestment resolution is really about,” she said.</p>\n<p>Goodman said he does not believe UCSB will ever vote to divest but said he dislikes the way two different sides have emerged surrounding the debate.</p>\n<p>“I hate the idea that there is a winner and a loser here,” Goodman said, adding that he believes UCSB’s student body is willing to engage in contentious dialogue instead of only “trying to pick a fight” with one another.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang did not comment on the university’s position on divestment but said it is the university’s “role and responsibility” to create a space where students can discuss controversial topics.</p>\n<p>“I so appreciate seeing our students engage in such a thoughtful and passionate discussion on this issue as well as others,” Yang said in a statement. “Listening to and learning from each other are among the great benefits of being part of a diverse campus community represented by a variety of perspectives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77952\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77952\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/","id":3587,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3586,3585,3584],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
