Sure, everyone has heard songs like “Monster Mash” and “Spooky Scary Skeletons,” and anyone who hasn’t listened to “Thriller” at least once in their lifetime has most likely been living under a rock for the past 30 years. This is a list featuring seven spooky songs you may not have heard before — or, if you have, maybe you never thought to listen to them on Halloween: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Walking On Air” by Kerli</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With its soft trilling notes and eerie imagery, this song has an undeniably creepy air to it. While the chorus is surprisingly catchy and upbeat, the song still manages to maintain an overall ghostly tone throughout, making it perfect for a Halloween playlist. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXMeZwO2qZ0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Creepy Doll” by Jonathan Coulton</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Jonathan Coulton is perhaps better known for writing songs featured in video games (such as “Still Alive” from Portal), but he has written stand-alone songs as well. Most of his songs (if not all of them) seem a little offbeat, but “Creepy Doll” takes the cake when it comes to spooky tunes. His lyrics, set against a chilling melody, tell an unsettling horror story as if you’re the one living it, making it a great choice if you want to curl up in bed with your headphones on a gloomy autumn night. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiEarqIBsdg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Stop, I’m Already Dead” by Deadboy and the Elephantmen</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There’s not much more to this song than a competent electric guitar and the lyrics “I am already dead” and yet, that’s all it really needs. This is a melody that manages to be morbid but fun at the same time. You can enjoy the song year-round, but with its death-centric title and chorus, it feels especially appropriate for Halloween </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E73IQx21DEo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Bloody Mary” by Lady Gaga: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an alias like Mother Monster, it should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga came up with some spooky songs of her own. The way she screams between verses and the way her voice becomes distorted during certain lines gives “Bloody Mary” a disturbing resonance. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFwmKL5OL-Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“King” by The Romanovs</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “King” is a siren’s song, telling the tale of a woman who lures men to their death. The melody is accompanied by a haunting harmony, and the song’s steady lilt overall proves beautiful yet macabre, a good fit for a grim holiday. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P911lpDWjp8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Seven Devils” by Florence + the</b> <b>Machine</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With lines like “I was dead when I woke up this morning” and “I’ll be dead before the day is done,” this song is undoubtedly chilling. Its slow, dramatic melody adds to the grim mood, as the lyrics paint a picture of someone being hunted down relentlessly. This song may not be the best at parties, but it’s an appropriately dark tune to listen to if you’re putting the finishing touches on your costume or carving a big smile into a pumpkin. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QdpCJIyyi4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Dead Fast Rap” by Boyinaband</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This fast-paced rap is short, sweet and to the point, as it finds as many ways as possible to use the word “dead” in under two minutes. The song uses clever plays-on-words while consistently clinging to a Halloween-appropriate theme of murder and death. The lyrics, seemingly from the perspective of a serial killer, are paired with an eerie beat that ties the whole thing together and makes it ideal for fall festivities. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ0dmeCKExg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a shadow of a doubt, there is a wide variety of spooky, scary Halloween-themed songs out there for you to enjoy. Hopefully, these creepy selections can help you get in a festive mood as you prepare for the spookiest night of the year.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/7-spooky-songs-for-your-halloween-playlist/","id":6680,"author":{"id":697,"name":"Phoebe Morales"},"related":[6679,6678,6677],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":697,"name":"Phoebe Morales","biography":"Not available","articles":[6680],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"SWMRS Deliver Exhilarating Sounds at Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22382124_1689698534387937_7433205716063106411_o.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22382124_1689698534387937_7433205716063106411_o.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The adrenaline of a garage rock show is comparable to drinking 10 Vietnamese iced coffees in one sitting.

The California rockers performed West Coast-infused tracks that entangled both eccentric narratives and blissful instrumentation.</p>\n<p>Sharp Shock, a band with members from across the world, kicked off the night with a performance of the gritty guitar-led track, “Infatuation.” The band kept the momentum going throughout the first couple of songs off the setlist, but the crowd began to get physically anxious to see SWMRS grace the stage.</p>\n<p>The adrenaline of a garage rock show is comparable to drinking 10 Vietnamese iced coffees in one sitting. Bay-area band SWMRS rose to prominence after releasing their album <em>Drive North</em>, which featured heavy doses of hip-hop and punk instrumental influences. The rumbling chorus of “Palm Trees” ignited the opening of SWMRS’s set. The moshing antics at punk shows often lead to dissenting touching, which lead singer Cole Becker is adamantly against. Becker warned the audience, “If somebody is touching you in an inappropriate way, punch that dude in the face, and if you don’t wanna punch them, we’ll gladly do it for you.” During small breaks between songs, Becker would use the time to make political commentary. “Fascism is on the rise in America. We need to unite during times like these and put an end to the injustices. And if you don’t remember anything from this show, at least remember that black lives matter.” This statement induced the crowd to give a round of applause for the band’s ability to use their own voices to spread a theme of inclusivity within their shows. SWMRS finds a way to vocalize the themes of diversity and openness both within the frame of a three-minute song and in the way they inform their fans.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Once the “Miley is a punk rock queen” hook rang out, the crowd began losing their pastel pink vans among the sea of teens loosening their pent-up aggression. During the drowsy love ballad “Lose It,” Max Becker stepped on top of the speakers to allow the crowd to sing along into his microphones. The hypnotic trance of Joey Armstrong’s drums on the performance of “Figuring It Out” even had a father of two children briskly meander his way into a mosh pit made up of 17-year-olds rocking overalls. The final song of the night was “Drive North,” which details the trivialities of Los Angeles. Becker laughed heartily and sang out the names of bands that have become synonymous with the Los Angeles DIY scene: “I hate FIDLAR, I hate Together Pangea.” Becker stopped the performance midway to give hand gestures indicative of heightening the mosh pit intensity. The band has evolved from the previous time they came to Santa Barbara, where they performed to a small crowd at the Funzone. Previously, the crowd only knew two songs the band put out on the “Miley/Uncool” EP. Flash forward to 2017, the band had Velvet Jones packed with teenagers knowing the lyrics to every song of <em>Drive North.</em></p>\n<p>After the brief delay for The Interrupters’ set, the vast majority of the crowd was doused in sweat from moshing. This was third-year UCSB biology major Edith Martinez’s third time seeing SWMRS perform. She recalled her admiration for the band’s lively performances: “This SWMRS show was by far the best show I have ever attended. The energy of not only the band but the crowd was intoxicating. I enjoyed singing along with my friends. This was truly a night I will never forget.”</p>\n<p>The Interrupters stepped onto the stage clad in suits and performed “A Friend Like Me,” from their self-titled 2014 album. Despite the crowd reducing in size after SWMRS wrapped up their performance, The Interrupters captivated the attention of the crowd by performing the head-banging track “She Got Arrested.” Throughout the performance of “Take Back the Power,” lead vocalist Aimee Allen’s raspy voice remained reminiscent of an early 2000s Gwen Stefani. The Interrupters embraced the unfamiliar as they fused elements of horn instruments with the backbone of the punk scene, the electric guitar.</p>\n<p>The radiant atmosphere of a punk show is centered on celebrating individuality and uniting over a mutual admiration for moshing.

This is the 23-year-old’s second album under the King Krule moniker, the first being <em>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</em>, which made waves in 2013 with its eclectic and precociously distinct sound and gained the attention and adoration of such famed artists as Beyoncé and Frank Ocean. But it seems Marshall wants to do some exploring while he’s still young; find himself; rebel a little. What sprung from his unsettled soul was an exercise in bipolar lunacy.</p>\n<p>Throughout the new project, the singer/songwriter/musician/producer whirls from lo-fi to hi-fi, across a spectrum of tempos and from sedated to agitated states in a manner that would be dizzying if it weren’t so seamless. There’s a balance to Marshall’s madness. He expands on the smooth moodiness of <em>6 Feet</em>, but his punk influences enjoy much more air time here. His vocal adaptations to these rougher, more addled sounds are even more compelling.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As some of the best things in life, Marshall’s voice is somewhat of an acquired taste. Its abundant richness can be overwhelming to the unaccustomed listener, but the low register and thick South London accent in which he sings provide a rawness much needed in an age when overproduction often sucks the life out of the human voice. King Krule’s music, on the other hand, comes from underneath you, and on this album takes you underwater. This is violently true on the album’s punkier cuts. The restless, distorted guitar riffs on songs like “Dum Surfer” and “Emergency Blimp” do well to complement Marshall’s deep and untethering vocals as they come to an aggravated boil. An echoing, bass-heavy symphony of waves crashes overhead. These songs have you bobbing your whole body and rattling inside it.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say Marshall can’t deliver a fantastic slow jam. On the wistfully declarative title track and the down-tempo, syncopated grooves of “Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver),” he fishes a jazzy melancholy from the depths of his soul. Tracks like these are the most personal on the album — and beautifully so. Between the latter’s soft weep of guitar chords comes the sobering and pensive reflection, “Why’d you leave me because of my depression? / You used to complete me, but I guess I learned a lesson.” Marshall exhibits a talent for loading and springing coils of emotion in the span of a couple lyrics. On countless occasions, he offers the uncanny prose of the troubled, disaffected mind. The barking refrain of “Slush Puppy,” “Nothin’ is workin’ with me,” bears the artist’s mounting frustration as it floats into the ether, dissipates and surrounds you. To resist absorbing it is thoroughly difficult. Marshall’s thoughts entice you into embracing them as your own, no matter how malignant they announce themselves to be. They wash over you, but they also wash beneath you, through you and within you.</p>\n<p><em>The OOZ</em> is a different atmosphere. Marshall plays the navigator of its deep, dark depths. In this collage of genres and influences, boundaries dissolve. King Krule creates a musical space totally new and unknown, where the recesses of the subconscious manifest as part of the landscape. <em>The OOZ</em> inhabits those late-night hours when the demons of the mind and city slink about. The freedom is theirs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2HRzIyyXvU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tia Rotolo: British singer Archy Marshall — better known as King Krule — returns to music, but not humanity, with the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, Oct. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its induction up until its final note, Marshall’s latest LP is in motion as a distorted expenditure through time and space, abandoning glorifications of permanence. With brutally honest imagery, King Krule wrestles with human emotions, despite making every effort to resent humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album begins slowly with “Biscuit Town.” Airy guitar riffs and static resemble a train moving over tracks. It’s familiar, but there’s something off about it. The track opens, “I seem to sink lower.” His deep, looming vocals immediately capture the listener in a firm grip juxtaposed with the delicate notes of the guitar. The song drops to a beat with every final note in the line lingering for slightly too long, evoking a discomfort that intrigues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there’s one thing King Krule has mastered, it’s creating something so eerie, so vile yet so addictive. His sound represents a sketchy alleyway at midnight: Even though we know better, we want to see what lies beyond. Howling chilling sounds, he challenges his audience to stay with him against all notions of common sense.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He presents his listener with one question: Where do we go when we don’t fit in anywhere? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His answer lies in a vast unknown, deep oceans and outer space. Both are odes to his previous albums and can be haunting to the average person, but he finds solace in them nonetheless. He’s lost and alone. His only places of belonging are where no one does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A town alarm warns listeners of the commencement of the song, “Sublunary.” In an auto-tuned alien-like voice, King Krule talks of being “made for sublunary,” a reference to an earlier King Krule record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 Feet Beneath the Moon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here, there are no physics, no humanity, and no emotions; This is where he belongs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sad as the album’s premise is, it doesn’t ask for sympathy. For each melodramatic line, Marshall presents a grotesque image of vomit or mutation, as done in “Lonely Blue.” He is not romantic; he is disgusting and vulgar, but also potent and unapologetic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like a lullaby, “Czech One” emulates a dream state. The song masters the feeling of wanting to fall asleep but being wide awake. Struggling with insomnia, the artist wrestles with the thought of the woman he can’t forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She still sits in my dreams,” he sings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He can’t escape her. Driven to insanity, Marshall and his listeners are invited to mourn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly every line is short and abrupt. This element of disjointment imitates a stream of consciousness, jumping from one thought to the next. What stitches each line together are the instrumentals, mediating the words to comprehension while sustaining the chaos of Marshall’s psyche.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Bermondsey Bosom (Right),” his father talks to the listener delicately over oriental sounds. He references Marshall’s previous albums, speaking as someone who knows him, but may not fully understand him. He’s unable to accept people and finds difficulty in distinguishing “paradise” and “parasites.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Half Man Half Shark,” the singer’s lack of humanity transitions into animalia. He distinguishes himself from others as empty and losing meaning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See world, you’ll never know/At least when you look to the stars they still glow/Well, not for me though</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” he sings, confirming that he’s the only one who can truly understand his own state of mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subtly drifting to a new dimension, the artist takes his listener to “The Cadet Leaps.”  With piano and static, he creates his own atmosphere. He’s lost but surrounded, gazing on humanity from a higher standpoint, watching the parasites and paradise get twisted in their own misconceptions. The listener discovers that the mysterious woman understood his condition and could transcend above humanity with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The title track begins with a woman speaking, “Its motion, it’s urgent, its trigger.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">King Krule in the background asks, “Is there anybody out there?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song is oozing with something unrefined. Pleas from Marshall include, “Could we align?” He’s desperate for human connection, but with someone who can understand. Melancholy and intricate, he is giving into companionship, slowly drifting back to a human place. “It’s cold by the fire,” he repeats again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album evens out with its closing track, “La Lune,” which uses elements of bass and guitar most resembling his earlier works. In addition to rain drizzling in the background and lighters being lit, he analyzes the human process of becoming the people we fall in love with, saying, “It won’t be long … / Till you’re inside my heart.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this song, as with much of the album, Marshall takes his listener to a familiar place of consciousness, but it’s a place that most people don’t wish to return to if they don’t have to. This is a place of darkness, where light isn’t known by its presence but solely by one’s belief in it. As a physical place, this state of mind can be related to the ocean and space, tying the themes of the album together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of leaving the disturbing mental state, King Krule soaks in its discomfort. In creating his home here, he can no longer be a human being, but instead becomes some adjunct of the universe. Yet, he still wrestles with human needs, as he wishes to be “Elevated with you.” The guitar riffs and static even out and eventually the listener is left alone in silence as the album ends simply and modestly. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is depressive, sometimes manic, but always unforgiving. King Krule does not wish to evoke sympathy or some romanticized images of the depression which ails him. He’s basking in the originality and repugnance of his suffering. He’s full of guilt and regret, but he’s recognized the value of these emotions. Attempting to find his position in time and space, he wrestles with what we know and what we’ve yet to truly understand about the human condition. There are no false idealizations of a physical home, but merely a presentation of a mental state worth diving into.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79201\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79201\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/","id":6679,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6678,6677,6676],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
