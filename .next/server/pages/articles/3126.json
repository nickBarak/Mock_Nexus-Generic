Executive Director Marisela Marquez rejected the question on the grounds that it was too specific for Wednesday night’s public Legislative Council meeting, prompting Bishop to clarify that her query described a hypothetical scenario involving any chair of any committee.</p>\n<p>Seemingly satisfied, Marquez explained how and why she utilizes preemptive action to follow through on impulses of keen perception and dispel the dangers of the unknown.</p>\n<p>“If you’re talking about, say, the Internal Vice President, it doesn’t have a vote but there is a great deal of pressure that could be brought on them, potentially,” Marquez said. “At the very least, there’s a perception of a conflict of interest; that’s the issue we’re charged with making sure doesn’t happen. If these are potentially two trains that are going to cross and derail, then why wait until it gets derailed?”</p>\n<p>Under the direction of Marquez, A.S. Associate Director for Special Projects Denise Rinaldi threatened to exercise the permanent staff’s power to terminate student employees in an ultimatum offered to former Judicial Council chair Jeanne Sabin. Given the choice to keep either her job as Legislative Council’s minute-taker — a title she’s held for three years that provides a consistent, hourly income — or her newly-appointed position as the non-voting chair of Judicial Council, Sabin tearfully resigned from the latter on Sept. 28.</p>\n<p>Sabin declined to comment, saying she feared repercussions from the permanent staff.</p>\n<p>Many members of the council, including Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, spoke out against Marquez’s claim that holding the two positions at once could present a plausible conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>“Because she’s the minute-taker of Legislative Council and she doesn’t hold an elected position … All she does is listen to what’s said and write it down,” Stryker said. “Students from both parties were really outraged.”</p>\n<p>A council member brought the issue of inconsistent policy enforcement to the meeting’s forefront when he attempted to explain how he knows other students who hold similar dual positions within A.S., but was interrupted when Stryker requested that he “try not to be specific, please.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Representative Kristian Whittaker, Marquez spoke to council members at Legislative Council’s retreat last weekend and encouraged them to consider holding closed meetings and speaking cryptically during open meetings to avoid controversy. While Article VI, Section 1 allows Legislative Council to hold closed meetings with the approval of two-thirds of the members, Whittaker said Marquez’s recommendations extended beyond conducting private business behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>“Well, what we would do is we would ask for the person [at the podium] to present an example that would be similar to the situation, but not so much exactly the situation,” Whittaker[[ok]] said.</p>\n<p>In spite of her own recommendations, Marquez allowed the violation of mandated vagueness and asked a favor of the council.</p>\n<p>“Staff would prefer not to do those dual appointments, so if you have those folks that you want to point out to me, that would be helpful,” Marquez said in complete seriousness as many council members and attendees failed to stifle their laughter.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Jonathan Abboud said whether or not the contentious policy is permitted, allegations of a conflict of interest simply do not make sense in Sabin’s case.</p>\n<p>“Jeanne is the most unbiased person in A.S.,” Abboud said. “I don’t think she would be biased at all, and that’s why I was so opposed to her being put in that position. … We were all really confused, like, ‘Did this just happen? Seriously?’”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Article VI, Section 2 of the Legal Code recognizes the A.S. President’s clear authority over the Executive Director, stating that “The President shall: 1) Be the Chief Executive Officer of the Associated Students and shall coordinate and be responsible for the functioning of the A.S. Executive Director.”</p>\n<p>Abboud cited Sabin’s excellent record with Presidents past and current as another compelling and legally verified reason to allow her to serve in both roles.</p>\n<p>“[Jeanne] has seen three different Legislative Councils, three different Presidents and she’s taken the minutes consistently,” Abboud said. “She really wanted to get involved in A.S. as an appointed member and that’s when she went to Judicial Council because that’s what she thought she’d be good at, and two different Presidents thought she would be good at that job — Harrison and Paul.”</p>\n<p>Former A.S. President J.P. Primeau, who served during the 2008-09 school year, said he often clashed with permanent staff members in a continuous struggle for authority.</p>\n<p>“One of my key goals as President was to change the relationship between students and administrators,” Primeau wrote in the A.S. 08-09 Annual Report. “I had always felt that, despite our tremendous ability to organize and advocate, we reacted to university policy after it had been established (Minimum Cumulative Progress being the prime example). To change that policy students would need to take a more proactive approach based on shared governance — simply put, more students needed to be at the table when big decisions were made.”</p>\n<p>Third Supervisorial District Representative for Santa Barbara County Democratic Central Committee and Mixed Student Union Co-Chair Nicole Leopardo, who ran for External Vice President of Local Affairs with the Democratic Process Party last Spring, said the staff’s hard work often goes unappreciated but has also threatened the autonomy of various groups and members within the organization.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I want the permanent staff to step in and make decisions because I feel like they might be the most logical people in some situations, but other times, like with this situation, [students] should be able to make their decisions,” Leopardo said. “Harrison should be able to make his appointments. That’s not saying we can’t be critical of him, but I just don’t know how I feel about permanent staff kind of stomping on his decisions.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Leopardo said she’s shocked by the permanent staff’s lack of legislative authorization for their interference in students’ jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one to check them,” Leopardo said. “There’s no one to say, ‘Hey, you’re not doing your job,’ and that’s what we as students should be doing. There is no democratic process; there are no checks and balances. Right now, it’s a difficult situation.”</p>\n<p>Sabin’s removal leaves the council below quorum with only two remaining members. As such, it cannot function as a judiciary body nor can it move forward with proceedings on currently unresolved cases, such as one from last Spring involving several members of Open People’s Party.</p>\n<p>As a result of unsubstantiated allegations, four elected Legislative Council members were removed from their positions and replaced by the four closest runners-up despite the fact that Judicial Council has yet to reach a ruling. The council is currently seeking applicants and was expected to resolve the case this quarter after accepting the accused party’s petition for a hearing in late May.</p>\n<p>Stryker said any students with concerns can contact the Attorney General or submit a petition or file a case with Judicial Council, which will be reviewed as soon as the entity reaches its quorum of three members.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Abboud said he will be working with the ad hoc committee to put measures in place to protect student employee rights.</p>\n<p>“My personal goal would be to codify exactly what rights A.S. [student] employees have,” Abboud said. “Do they or do they not have the right to be appointed members of A.S.? Personally, I would want them to have that right; probably everyone on Legislative Council does, but I’m not going to speak for them — I can’t — but it seems that she should be able to participate in A.S. and take our minutes.”</p>\n<p>Stryker said while maintaining a working balance between the staff and the students can be taxing, a unified Legislative Council can reinstate its ultimate authority by ballot, if needed.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really tough relationship between the staff end of A.S. and the Legal Code part of A.S. because there’s nothing really in the Legal Code that gives any protection over the students when it comes to what happens if admin disagrees, except for the Executive Director — she can be voted out by three-fourths of Legislative Council.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The first installment of this article can be found at the following location: http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/director-intrudes-student-rights/</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/council-clashes-permanent-staff/","id":3126,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3125,3124,3123],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman","biography":"Not available","articles":[3126,3147,3155,3498],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Representatives</strong></p>\n<p>Six unelected representatives were sworn in to the 2011-2012 Associated Students Legislative Council at last night’s meeting to replace four newly elected representatives involved in an ongoing judicial council case in addition to two representative-elects who have officially resigned.</p>\n<p>After pleading no contest to charges of grand theft, unauthorized alteration of a computer data system, felony burglary and receiving stolen property at his preliminary hearing yesterday, Representative-at-Large-elect Joe Lee formally stepped down from his position, citing “idiotic political pressure … roaming around A.S.” Lee, who was replaced by Democratic Process Party representative-at-large Sophia Armen, went on to accuse an unnamed fellow council member of extortion during the meeting’s public forum. Lee is scheduled to appear in court for his next hearing on June 22.</p>\n<p>In addition, Open People’s Party On-Campus Representative-elect Pancho Occiano chose to defer his position on next year’s council to D.P.P. On-Campus Representative Christian Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Four elected O.P.P. members — Representatives-at-Large Kelly Gandee and Chelsea Parrott and Off-Campus Representatives Lauren Begleiter and Alexa Cover — were charged with supplying alcohol to minors during Spring Elections by A.S. Elections Committee on May 6 and face either disqualification or forced resignation pending Judicial Council’s approval of the case. The four were replaced by D.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Xenia Mendez and Marlene Moreno and D.P.P. Representatives-at-Large Danielle Stevens and Danielle Bermudez.</p>\n<p>Four additional council members — O.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Danielle Foster, Reena Fram and Drey Liautaud and O.P.P. Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter — were charged with the same infraction but given the option to either resign or serve their terms without receiving honoraria. All four were sworn in last night and plan to remain on the council. Former Legislative Council members Yeni Nguyen and Kellie Hartl were also implicated in the case but may not fall under the purview of Elections Committee as they are no longer student government representatives. O.P.P. Executive Board members President Harrison Weber, Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, External Vice President of Local Affairs Tim Benson and External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Ahmed Mostafa were also charged and given the option to either resign or serve as planned and complete 45 hours of A.S.-related community service each during the 2011-2012 academic year. All four plan to remain in their newly appointed positions.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is slated to inform the individuals today of its decision to either approve Elections Committee’s recommendations or hear an appeal drafted by the Executive board members on behalf of all 14 implicated students.</p>\n<p>According to Benson, Elections Committee — which holds closed meetings only — reached their decision in a manner not consistent with A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely taking [the case] to Judicial Council because we feel that, based on the Legal Code and based on the rules that are in place for the elections committee, they followed them improperly and we were unjustly given pretty harsh punishments,” Benson said. “They never gave me any due process in any of this. I felt that it wasn’t really fair that I was given no chance to explain myself, no chance to explain any of my involvement in what was going on and I was given quite a hefty slap on the wrist.”</p>\n<p>Visit dailynexus.com for online updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular Business</strong></p>\n<p>In their final meeting, the 2010-2011 council approved a reallocation of $700 for a planned UC Haiti Initiative and set aside $55,000 — comprised of funding from the budgets of various BCCs — to fund the A.S. Annex, an Isla Vista community center that provide offices for A.S. entities, in the next fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis said while he supported the allocation, he is concerned the center’s location is not accessible to students in the community.</p>\n<p>“I think this is a great bill but I drove by and checked out the building, and it seems a bit hidden,” Lewis said. “I’d eventually like to have a sign or notice on that street to attract some attention since I don’t think it’ll get a lot of foot traffic on its own.”</p>\n<p>Former Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said the resolution provides that there will be such signs in the surrounding area of the center.</p>\n<p>The council reallocated $200 instead of an originally requested $467 for Black Graduation to print graduation programs. Lewis said the funding did not seem necessary as it would benefit only a select number of students.</p>\n<p>“I just don’t feel it represents the entire student body as student funds should,” Lewis said. “I feel it’s exclusive to the rest of the student body.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville authored a Green Bill mandating sustainable practices within A.S. buildings, including recycling, composting, avoiding paper and using green cleaning products. The bill was amended to include a mandate that A.S. funds given for group events or meetings may only purchase food that is at least 50 percent sustainable.</p>\n<p>While Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez said the request would be unrealistic for student groups and drive up event costs, Mayville said the bill is intended to set a precedent for the rest of the student body.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize it is expensive, but I think a little less food or more costly food is worth it because it is socially and environmentally responsible, and A.S. needs to set an example,” Mayville said.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker said the bill’s specificity would make it difficult to enforce.</p>\n<p>“Coming from a Finance board perspective, another really tough thing will be how to let groups know about all this,” Stryker said. “It’s going to be hard for groups to follow all of this. Make it more broad so student groups can feasibly follow and understand it.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the council has the duty to implement progressive policies and student groups have been asked to follow similar rules in the past.</p>\n<p>“[Office of Student Life] groups learn so quickly about what our funding policies are,” Tzankov said. “I think it’s important that we do set the precedent and we don’t put this off, but approve it as it is.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually passed the bill with an amendment making it applicable to only A.S. entities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated over a bill to increase transparency within the group by posting audio recordings of its weekly meetings on the association’s website. However, the bill failed to pass due to expensive software and microphone costs. Tsankov said he recommended that the newly appointed council continue discussion on the measure.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39346\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39346\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/","id":3123,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3122,3121,3120],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
