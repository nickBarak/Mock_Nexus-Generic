","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Sophie Xu, a recent UC Santa Barbara alumna who graduated in March 2019, purchased Sweet Alley from longtime friend and owner Peter Sun, she had no idea what to do with all the extra frozen yogurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So she gave it away for free. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 15, the Sweet Alley franchise in Isla Vista opened its doors for the last time, celebrated by a large line eager to get a final taste of the store’s nine-year legacy. With the doors now closed, Xu has begun preparing to transition the store into Vons Chicken, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a San Jose-based franchise that serves over 10 different renditions of authentic Korean fried chicken. The store will be one of seven Vons franchises in the state and the only one in Southern California.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88793\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88793\" data-attachment-id=\"88793\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/korean-fried-chicken-restaurant-set-to-open-in-i-v-in-coming-months/sweet-alley_ida-kazerani_online/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sweet Alley_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88793 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu said she is looking forward to the day she can flip the “closed” sign outside the store. </span><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For customers who are looking to avoid the grease, Xu said she will be expanding Vons’ menu to include oven-cooked chicken as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu said she originally had no intention to buy Sweet Alley, as she already owns and manages Goleta restaurants Uniboil and Phresh Teas. But with the help of perfect timing and a movie that changed her mind, Xu decided to open her wallet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a Korean movie about policemen who watch drug dealers from a fried chicken place across the street. The fried chicken place was about to close down, so they bought the place to watch the drug dealers,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, Xu offered to purchase Sweet Alley from Sun on a whim, who had been struggling to find a new owner for months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw [Sun’s] advertisement, and then the next day, I asked him if [Sweet Alley] is still on the market. He said, ‘Yes.’ And then the next day, I gave him the deposit.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With renovations set to begin next month, Xu wants to welcome customers with a completely new interior. On top of selling the frozen yogurt equipment, she plans to tear down old walls and refurnish the entire store; she is also flirting with obtaining a light liquor license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The internal wall will be knocked down and moved further back, and I’ll add a small countertop so this whole area can be a sitting area,” she said, pointing to the concrete slab where customers used to walk up to get their frozen yogurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVs and dessert are also on Xu’s short list of amenities to include at her Vons, on top of the boba she plans to bring daily from Phresh Teas, a restaurant of hers dedicated to serving a variety of different tea creations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the unit’s small footprint, Xu estimates she will need roughly half the amount of employees she has staffed at her other restaurants. Instead of hiring former Sweet Alley employees, Xu said she will be “pick[ing] from Uniboil staff” and offering them a spot at the new store. Xu expects Vons will be managed by the wife of the current Uniboil head chef.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure authenticity, Xu said Vons flies trainers directly from South Korea to host trainings for employees whenever a new store opens — a franchise policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Uniboil, which follows a more traditional restaurant style, Xu plans to make Vons more expedient so customers can just “grab and go.” If a customer simply wants to buy food and leave, Xu estimates they can be on their way in as little as 10 minutes. If customers would like to stay and eat, however, they’ll have plenty of time to choose when to come in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, I’m thinking Monday through Thursday, we’ll do 3 o’clock to 11 o’clock and 3 o’clock to two in the morning Friday through Sunday,” Xu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If fried chicken isn’t enough to fill customers’s stomachs, Xu said desserts will be available as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll be selling boba cake — a milk tea cake with boba on it — and also coconut jellos, which is made of coconut juice and real coconut with jello inside. We’ll also be selling Hong-Kong style desserts and street food,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further impress palates, Xu said she is working with a local chef who is skilled in making authentic “Chinese street snacks.” She said the chef currently works from home and only delivers food from his house. If everything goes according to plan, Xu said, those street snacks may soon be on Vons’ menu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu also plans on developing a “really strong delivery system.” Not only will this allow Vons to serve food beyond its own walls, but it will also help the store remain competitive, as most restaurants in I.V. offer some form of delivery service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has a lot of work ahead of her in the coming months, Xu said she is looking forward to the day she can flip the “closed” sign outside the store, which will be sometime in the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once complete, Xu said Vons will be the sole restaurant in I.V. where customers can sink their teeth into Korean-fried “flats” and “drums” — the industry-standard cuts of chicken that are commonly fried into delicacies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no good fried chicken around here. We only have KFC — not even a Popeyes or Wingstop. We don’t have anything. That’s why I think this will be a really good idea for a chicken place,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Barthelemy began to curate these objects to preserve them in the weeks following the tragedy for a public exhibit that would be ready by the first anniversary of the tragedy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 10 weeks of exhibition at Old Gym, all of the objects were archived on the Special Collections section of the Davidson Library, located on the third floor. But it wasn’t until this past year that an online collection of the exhibit began to gain momentum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This five-year project culminated this Wednesday with “We Remember Them: Acts of Love and Compassion in Isla Vista,” where the exhibit’s new website was unveiled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://islavistamemorialproject.omeka.net/exhibits/show/werememberthem\">website</a> is a recreation of the original exhibit, meant to be seen room by room, and allows users to search for specific remembrance items with detailed information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lauren Trujillo, a library and information science masters student at UC Los Angeles, played a key role in helping the Isla Vista Memorial Project come to fruition. She first became involved in the project as a second-year student at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Trujillo began working on the project because of her interest in archiving, she also had a personal connection to the Isla Vista tragedy; as a member of Delta Delta Delta, commonly known as Tri Delta, Trujillo was a close friend of victims Katie Cooper and Veronika Weiss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I] wasn’t sure if that would be too personal for me, but I knew I had to do it. I had to be the voice for my sorority sisters, I had to be the voice for undergraduate students and get our stories straight from what the media had torn apart … so taking it back was something that I could help with this narrative,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Trujillo has been creating a website for the Isla Vista Memorial Project to commemorate the fifth year anniversary and received funding through a year-long grant at UCLA from the Mellon Foundation to do so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trujillo’s aim with the online exhibition was to allow people to access the materials at a time when they were ready to address what was a highly traumatic event, especially for alumni who had been around in 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do know that other students weren’t ready to go through the exhibition yet. They weren’t ready to readdress that trauma again,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted the importance of educating students who weren’t here for the tragedy on how the community came together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can find the details of what happened that day on the Internet, but you can’t find how our community reacted and all the great things that came out of this unspeakable event … for them to see our community’s story and how UCSB and how Gauchos reacted and how we came together can help them understand the campus they belong to and the campus that they are contributing to,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original Isla Vista Memorial Project, as well as its new website, show I.V. in a different light compared to media’s response to the Isla Vista tragedy, Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The news just grabs any photo [they] can get, which is whatever happens to be on your Facebook profile at that second. And so, for the families not to be able to choose the photograph they want to represent their loved one is a really big deal,” Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This project gave those families the opportunity to choose a picture of their loved one, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can imagine that was really emotional for them to go through photographs and choose one, and it was emotional for us too,” Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Isla Vista Memorial Project evolved over the past five years, Barthelemy and Trujillo’s work to memorialize the tragedy has grown. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barthelemy became the official liaison between the university administration and the families of the victims, a position she said is unique to UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now, Barthelemy said she is ready to hand some of the responsibilities over to UCSB administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to develop really close relationships with the family… [but] I’m going to just be able to focus more on my history work and not so much the administrative stuff, but I want the families to be very well taken care of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Trujillo, continuing work on the Isla Vista Memorial Project was a way to continue healing after the loss of her friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing that I had to realize was that trauma, you never get over it, and I had to accept that. I’m never going to get over this. So sometimes when I’m working with an object or if I see something and it makes me cry, it’s okay and I can let it out,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But then the next day, and another day, I can continue working with these things and feel like I’m doing this for a bigger reason.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Platoff, UCSB librarian and Isla Vista Memorial Archive curator, told the audience at the opening of the exhibit on Wednesday night that working on such a personal exhibit has led to a greater political energy for those working on the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can be professional in your daily work with the materials, but we are also people with opinions who read and participate in our community … when I leave the library at night, I’m political,” Platoff said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Trujillo is proud of the work she has done, she said she sometimes harbored guilt about the shootings that have occurred since Isla Vista’s own tragedy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt guilty that we could have done more in 2014, and [I] should have gone out and started speaking and done more to make them stop happening,” Trujillo said. “Hopefully by sharing this online exhibition and by sharing these items in a university space, we can start conversations and we can inspire action of some sort … [these shootings] need to stop and it’s been re-traumatizing every time another community’s affected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m blessed for what I’ve been able to do, but I do feel the sense to do more.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heather Carr contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-88556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The organization held a “Beloved Community Common Table” on Saturday with the hope of bringing together the community. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project was inspired by an adaptation of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s three pillars of “discrimination, militarization and consumers,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these three pillars, according to the other co-chair of the Beloved Community Project and former External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Jeike Meijer, are not limited to the Beloved Community Project — they represent community as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Meijer, community is “a connection of people.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In kindergarten you see those globes with little people holding hands — that’s what I always think about when I think about community, as cheesy as it sounds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception, Collins Puente said the Beloved Community Project’s organizing committee, made up of 25 students and staff members, has helped sponsor and organize a variety of community outreach and healing events in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the second anniversary of the Isla Vista tragedy neared, Collins Puente said the A.S. body at the time sought to “honor and commemorate the lives lost” while also fostering conversations that would allow the community to heal from the tragedy in a positive manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2016, the Beloved Community Project began working toward that goal by hosting a two-day conference in I.V. with the hope to “bridge all parts of the community,” Collins Puente said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the conference — which took place in six different locations in I.V. — was a major stepping stone in the Beloved Community Project’s development and was sponsored and funded by over 30 different local organizations, including I.V. Youth Projects, St. George Family Youth Center, I.V. Food Co-op and I.V. Recreation and Parks District.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During one segment of the conference titled “I.V. Talks,” Collins Puente said “elders in the community, houseless members of the community and youth of the community” all spoke to their experiences in I.V. while “working toward a common goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her most memorable experience with the Beloved Community Project took place during Fall Quarter 2018, when Meijer —  in collaboration with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Beloved Community — went door-to-door in I.V. and distributed the tote bags as a way to “introduc[e] people to their neighbors and Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other goods, each tote bag contained an “Isla Vista guide” with letters written by local middle school students. The letters asked that college students acknowledge the middle school students in the community and addressed “how to take care of this community for everybody,” Meijer said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88557\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/the-beloved-community-project-strives-to-serve-as-a-beacon-of-hope/people_s-park_ida-kazerani_online-6-3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-88557\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88557\" data-attachment-id=\"88557\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/the-beloved-community-project-strives-to-serve-as-a-beacon-of-hope/people_s-park_ida-kazerani_online-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"People_s Park_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE (6)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88557\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Collins Puente finds that taking care of the community does not always involve an event of its own. She said the “porous” nature of the project allows it to foster change in other forms as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re feeling like we’re making a connection with a person that feels much closer to their own idea of community, then that is actually the product we want at the end of it … Our process is our product,” Collins Puente said about the core philosophy of the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she draws from that philosophy for motivation to maintain the project and foster new initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a part of the Beloved Community Project is simple, Collins Puente noted — when living in I.V., “there is no membership. You are already part of Beloved Community.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
