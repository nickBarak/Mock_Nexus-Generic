Vigna’s talk on malware, short for malicious software, will discuss research being developed to fight cybercriminals who quickly adapt to countermeasures being deployed in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, the lecture will focus on four key questions: “What is malware?,” “How does it operate?,” “How does it affect us?” and “How can the average person protect themselves?”</p>\n<p>“Everyone is susceptible to malware,” Vigna said. “If you’re on the Internet you will be attacked one way or another and it’s important to know how it works.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said the damage caused by malware varies in strength but can create major repercussions, especially for students.</p>\n<p>“Malware can steal personal information, like your bank info, and sell it in the underground market for money,” Vigna said. “They could encrypt your files and ask for a ransom. If you do not have a backup you will not be able to get your files back, which can be especially troublesome for students who may have a project or a big paper due the next day.”</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, writing malware is as difficult as coding any other computer program, varying in strength and complexity depending on the developer’s experience.</p>\n<p>“It takes skill when you want do something very sophisticated that hides its presence very well,” Vigna said. “There is very simple malware … and there is other sophisticated malware that goes deep into the operating system.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said that protecting against malware is a competition between defense and attacker because the superior program comes out on top.</p>\n<p>“You’re against another person trying to make your stuff work against his; it is a battle against one another,” Vigna said. “It’s an arms race.”</p>\n<p>Vigna also said malware changes at a rapid rate because it, and the products developed to detect it, is continuously evolving.</p>\n<p>“We come out with new techniques to detect malware and they’ll come out with new techniques from our techniques, and we have to come out with new way to find theirs,” Vigna said. “It’s continued evolution.”</p>\n<p>First-year film and media studies major Andrew Okeh said students should take cybersecurity classes in high school because they depend on computers now more than generations before them.</p>\n<p>“With this increase in computer use it would be wise to implement basic ‘safe online behavior classes,’ like how we learn about having safe sex,” Okeh said. “I mean it is 2015! Practices like installing anti-malware software, updating computers, not using random networks or downloading stuff from sketchy websites.”</p>\n<p>Second-year computer science major Dylan Lynch said he is interested in attending Vigna’s talk because cyber security is relevant to anyone who uses the Internet.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited to attend the talk because I think computer security is growing to be a really lucrative field,” Lynch said. “It’s very relevant because of all the companies people trust with their personal information.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/","id":2804,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2803,2802,2801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel","biography":"Not available","articles":[999,2610,2699,2798,2804,2838,2843,2845,2887,2901,2922,2950,2967,2968,2985,3445,4573,4652,4658,4659,4679,4680,4697,4804,4816],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

I’ve done it for a couple years, but it’s just great every year to see that students want to participate in the whole electoral process, that they want to get educated on, you know, who’s coming out and I’m just really excited to start the year,” Villarreal said. “I was nervous. It’s always fun; it’s always a little nerve wracking during the election period but just now I’m ready to start going to work.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and current EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is apprehensive about the UC tuition hikes and expressed his willingness to aid Mirza and Lopez in their continued work with A.S.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is seeing how tuition increase and all that will go next year, and making sure both of them are prepped for it, and of course I’m going to be there to prep them before I term out,” Singh said. “I mean I was pretty comfortable being in that room and seeing whatever happened so at this point I’m just making sure both of them are set for their path from now on.”</p>\n<p>Incoming IVP and third-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian said while she is looking forward to taking office, she was disappointed her fellow Open People’s Party EVPSA candidate Lopez lost the campaign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62781\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"444391965\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62764\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62781\" data-attachment-id=\"62781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/a-s-elections-end-with-near-sweep/elections-will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429817311\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62781 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former executives came by to see the election results. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“As a party it’s like we don’t win until we all win, so we were very nervous about the EVPSA position and once his is announced it was kinda like the mood kinda went down,” Hashemian said. “So when mine was announced I was excited but at the same time, you know, in my mind there was still the fact that our EVPSA did not win so it’s not as joyous as I wish it were.”</p>\n<p>Current Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she is satisfied with her accomplishments during her term in office and is looking forward to the continued improvements to be made by Hashemian.</p>\n<p>“What I hope that she can improve from what I did last year is just to really transition better and do a better orientation for the entire association,” Lau said. “I thought I did a really good job with the senators and the senators I felt like were really equipped with all the different resources and things they needed to know to be in office.

night.</p>\n<p>Three TEDxManhattan videos were presented at the talk, including “Why is Organic Food so *#@! Expensive?,” “How Ugly, Unloved Food Can Change the World” and “Cultivating Equality in the Food System.” Local guest speakers from I.V. were also featured and attendees received free coupons, cookbooks and snacks at the event.</p>\n<p>According to Food Co-op Outreach &amp; Education Coordinator Ashley Audycki, the event was held to prompt local discussion among university students and I.V. residents on sustainable food solutions and to allow individuals working on solutions to meet and exchange ideas.</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major and representative for the Merton cooperative house on Camino Pescadero Doan Ngo said she has a passion for food justice and for purchasing local, organic foods and has identified a way to do it.</p>\n<p>“It all comes down to my conviction that eating organic and locally can have a prominent impact on our environment and economy,” Ngo said. “Before joining SB housing co-op and working at I.V. Food Co-op, I was aware of many food justice issues but failed to eat locally and organically with my very tight budget. I now believe that living cooperatively is the solution to make organic, local food financially sustainable.”</p>\n<p>According to Ngo, as a shopper for Merton, she hopes to change her housemates’ routine of shopping for groceries based on price.</p>\n<p>“I’m attending this talk is because I am currently a food shopper for our house, Merton Co-op, and I would like to deepen my understanding of the issue so that I can educate my housemates,” Ngo said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62635\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62635\" data-attachment-id=\"62635\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/tedx_paris-cullen-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429641325\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"27\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TEDx_Paris Cullen-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62635 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62635\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Ngo said she provides 18 people at the Merton House with organic foods for $100 per month to benefit the local economy as well as the environment which, according to her, is advantageous for multiple reasons.</p>\n<p>“Sharing food with 18 other college students provide us the buying capital to support our local farmers and businesses while reducing food waste and carbon foot print,” Ngo said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Nancy Yang, representing the university’s proposed Food Cart Working Group, discussed a program seeking to launch food carts on campus serving produce from local farmers and vendors.</p>\n<p>“The seeds for this project were really planted about five years ago by a group of students who saw that there was definitely an option for an alternative meal on campus that sought to launch a food cart that was student run,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, students have voiced a need for more healthy and organic options on campus.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to really show both campus leaders and administrators — as well as other orgs — we could partner with that this is something students want,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>EAB Community Food Impact Coordinator Biby Landaverde discussed a sustainable cooking competition hosted by EAB weekly to encourage cooking creatively using simple ingredients. According to Landeverde, participants upload recipes on to Facebook, where the winner is chosen weekly.</p>\n<p>“Every week we have an ingredient … the competition has been going on for two weeks already. The first week our secret ingredient was oranges and then last week our secret ingredient was carrots.” Landaverde said. “Whoever has the most votes at the end of the week is the winner,” Landeverde said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62634\" style=\"width: 315px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62634\" data-attachment-id=\"62634\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/tedx_paris-cullen-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429640983\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TEDx_Paris Cullen-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62634\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1-250x167.jpg?resize=305%2C204\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"305\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Youth Projects representative Maya Topitzer said I.V.

Capps Center’s Forum on Ethics and Public Policy, discussed whether or not university administrations do enough to prevent sexual assault. Recently, Jackson and Williams have both introduced legislation geared toward ending sexual violence on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Event coordinator Gregory Jarrett said the Capps Center does not endorse specific politicians or legislation but denounces sexual assault as an ethical issue.</p>\n<p>“We are decidedly not neutral on ethics and we do not feign indifference to the fact that this is a profoundly neglected problem not just for the survivors of sexual assault, but for all women and their Title IX right to an equal education and equal protection under the law,” Jarrett said.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson it is currently unsafe for women to walk alone around college campuses, the very environments which are supposed to foster the education of the “future leaders of our state.”</p>\n<p>“According to the Department of Justice, 1 in 5 college women experience rape or attempted rape during their time as a student, and we know that less than five percent of all rapes and attempted rapes are reported,” Jackson said. “I believe we have a duty to continue to transform the culture on our campuses and make them safer environments for our students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62754\" style=\"width: 332px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62754\" data-attachment-id=\"62754\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/representatives-discuss-sexual-assault-policy-culture/hbj-and-dw_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429821915\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"HBJ and DW_Christina DeMarzo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62754\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2-250x166.jpg?resize=322%2C214\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"322\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jackson, who joint-authored Senate Bill 967 — popularly known as the “Yes Means Yes” law — last year, said the now-passed legislation can affect change if the language in the bill is appropriately enforced.</p>\n<p>“Only ‘yes’ means ‘yes,’ and it requires college campuses to educate students about consent and sexual assault,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said various types of media, such as YouTube videos, trivialize sexual assault and rape and schools need to counter this message with education.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, university disciplinary codes should be strong enough to adequately penalize perpetrators of sexual assault, because survivors often do not want to involve law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“This is criminal conduct and if we cannot find you guilty of a crime;
