Slowly, a tall, dark, curvaceous figure walked onto center stage and the spotlight flicked its switch. Standing in front and center was the six-time Tony Award-winning Broadway legend, Audra McDonald.</p>\n<p>The renowned singer came to Santa Barbara as part of UCSB’s Arts &amp; Lectures 2014-15 season. Getting McDonald to come was a tough process, but after years and years of persistence courting, she finally agreed to a performance date for her latest tour. Having just finished her Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, <em>Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill </em>in September, the legend began her nationwide tour to cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and finally, Santa Barbara.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dressed in a long, black, body-hugging gown, the Tony Award-winner sparkled in diamonds in front of her enthralled audience. After a few quick words of introductions, the singer opened her lips and her famous voice vibrated across the room. The very first song, “Sing Happy” from the musical <em>Flora the Red Menace, </em>was made famous by another Broadway legend, Liza Minelli, when she was only 19 years old. The song, a superb joyful melody about an optimistic quest for happiness, was the most appropriate appetizer to a five course dinner. McDonald sang classic and contemporary songs from well-known musicals and composers such as Cole Porter. She even remixed a version of Porter’s “Let’s Not Talk about Love” to one based on her own life.</p>\n<p>Anecdotes filtered throughout the show. “Every day before I would go to my rehearsal for <em>Lady Day</em>, I would stop by office, that being Chipotle,” said the Broadway legend. “And one day, there was a man sitting outside of Chipotle in Massachusetts, singing this song, and when I heard it, I knew I wanted to put it in my repertoire.” The song was “My Buddy,” a number composed by Walter Donaldson and Gus Kahn in 1922.</p>\n<p>McDonald sang for a variety of emotions, from sad music to joyful and optimistic tunes. The ballad “I’ll Be Here,” written by Adam Gwon, told the story about a lover who was killed in the September 11 attacks. In keeping with an optimistic tone, the lyrics spoke of forgiveness and memories after loved ones pass on. The German-born singer also performed music from young contemporary composers such as Shaina Taub’s “What Otters Do” and Jason Robert Brown’s “Stars and the Moon.”</p>\n<p>Although born in Germany, McDonald was raised in Fresno, California. She went to Juilliard, a performing arts school in New York City where hopeful aspiring young musical talents come to learn their craft. She first started on Broadway in a musical, “Carousel,” where she won her first Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress. By age 28, the young talent had won two other Tony Awards. As of 2014, McDonald had won every single Tony acting category, totaling six awards.</p>\n<p>Later, the singer turned actress and starred in a recurring role on “Law and Order: Special Victims Unit” in 2000. From 2007 to 2013, she became a series regular on the “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff, “Private Practice.” After “Private Practice,” McDonald returned to Broadway in the musical <em>Porgy and Bess </em>where she won her fifth Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical.</p>\n<p>As the night at the Granada came to a close, the Broadway legend thanked the audience for their generous support and introduced her last song. “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” from the classic musical <em>The Sound of Music</em> is one that McDonald has mastered, as she had previously sang it on NBC. When the last lyric was sung and the audience rose to give the star her standing ovation, the singer bowed and walked off stage. Within a matter of minutes, McDonald walked back onstage and together with the audience, sang the old New Year’s classic “Auld Lang Syne” as a last celebration to a wonderful evening.</p>\n<p>Having won every possible Tony Award as a Broadway actress, Audra McDonald is a powerhouse singer and a force to be reckoned with. The 44-year-old made history as the first ever woman to win a Tony in each acting category, and as of this moment, nothing is stopping her from continuing to win more awards for all the years to come.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>For more information on how to see Audra McDonald live in concert, visit </em><a href=\"http://audramcdonald.net/\">audramcdonald.net</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59207\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-tonys-after-tonys-broadway-legend-audra-mcdonald-wows-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59207\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-tonys-after-tonys-broadway-legend-audra-mcdonald-wows-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-tonys-after-tonys-broadway-legend-audra-mcdonald-wows-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-tonys-after-tonys-broadway-legend-audra-mcdonald-wows-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-tonys-after-tonys-broadway-legend-audra-mcdonald-wows-santa-barbara/","id":7017,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[7016,7015,7014],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen","biography":"Not available","articles":[5863,5906,5980,6042,6068,6754,6762,6780,6826,6833,6886,6897,6905,6975,7017],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB A Capella Group InterVals Hosts “Interstellar” Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Dec. 5, the tiny lecture hall that is Music 1145 was filled with harmonious voices, rhythmic clapping and about three or so aluminum foil hats.

If those factors don’t seem to add up, then let it be known — this was an “Interstellar” themed a capella concert hosted by UC Santa Barbara’s youngest a capella group, InterVals. Online, their group description is summed up in one sentence: “Basically, we’re a quirky, fun family that loves to sing.”</p>\n<p>Before InterVals’ “quirky” performance, two other UCSB a capella groups, Vocal Motion and Naked Voices, graced the 70s-style wooden floor of Music 1145. Both groups were clad in tees embossed with their respective logos; Vocal Motion’s shirts had their trademark “VM” while Naked Voices’ boldly said, “Get Naked.” UCSB’s only all-female a capella group, Vocal Motion, gave a soulful rendition of “Barton Hollow” by the Civil Wars. Naked Voices charmed the crowd with Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” and some seriously cheesy (albeit crowd-pleasing) choreography.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget Brothas from Otha Mothas, a personal favorite of mine (maybe I’m a little biased because I went to their last concert and it was awesome — check out the article here HYPERLINK PLEASE!).

Living up to the quirky label, most dressed up in galaxy-print attire, sporting star headbands and galactic shirts. Others slapped some aluminum foil on their head and called it a day (hence the three or so aluminum foil hats).</p>\n<p>After introductions, InterVals launched straightaway into their first song, “The Show Goes On” by Lupe Fiasco, and filled the humble venue with joyous energy. Each member showed off their abilities to groove, as not a single song sung was without the accompaniment of a little bit of hip shaking and a lot of wild arm movement.</p>\n<p>After the opening song, a rap portion ensued. I should have expected this, as spontaneous rap-offs seem to be a trend with all of the a capella groups. But what I wasn’t expecting was the main rapper to be the smallest member of InterVals. Her rapping packed a swag-filled punch, and matched with the beat boxing of the tallest member of the group. He also rapped, interjecting at one point with a “We’re in space, yeah!”</p>\n<p>Keeping with the theme, space trivia provided transitions between songs. Fingering his aluminum foil hat, one of the men of InterVals said, “Well, I think my hat is breaking. But did you know that the fastest particle ever detected was the Oh-My-God particle over Texas?”</p>\n<p>Adorably dorky transitioning aside, InterVals wowed the crowd with strong vocals and rich harmonies. Some memorable performances were the well-organized and catchy renditions of Dexys Midnight Runners’ “Come on Eileen,” Katzenjammer’s “God’s Great Storm” and a wildcard — the innuendo-filled “Pants” by Here Come the Mummies.</p>\n<p>Overall, InterVals’s last fall show made for a solidly entertaining night. Filled to the brim with laughs, clapping and toe tapping, their quirky concert made them hard not to love. Aluminum foil hats off to this fun bunch.</p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><i>To get in touch with InterVals, check them out on </i><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/InterValsUCSB\">facebook.com/InterValsUCSB</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59190\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-14/ucsb-a-capella-group-intervals-hosts-interstellar-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59190\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-14/ucsb-a-capella-group-intervals-hosts-interstellar-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-14/ucsb-a-capella-group-intervals-hosts-interstellar-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-14/ucsb-a-capella-group-intervals-hosts-interstellar-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-14/ucsb-a-capella-group-intervals-hosts-interstellar-show/","id":7014,"author":{"id":732,"name":"Mackenzie Hart"},"related":[7013,7012,7011],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Partying with IamSu!, Waka Flocka Flame & Brick Squad at Earl Warren Showgrounds","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When the party bus finally arrived on Seville Road on Nov. 22, the line of concert-goers quickly stormed in, pulled out their pre-game kit and began to dance, even before the bus started rolling.

We danced and did screaming renditions of popping hip-hop anthems nonstop, even while crashing into each other as the bus turned corners. We finally arrived at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, ready.</p>\n<p>After shivering in line from both the cold and my excitement, I got in through the doors just in time to catch Aleyes and Captain$een, winners of the local talent contest, who were rapping up a storm in Earl Warren Showgrounds. The place looked like it was the lovechild of an empty warehouse and circus tent; it was magical. The empty showgrounds quickly filled up with eager souls, ready for a wild night and dressed to impress in bucket hats, pleather bustiers, striped jerseys and such.</p>\n<p>The next acts were local DJ’s, Tyler Buron and Dubflo, both graduates of UCSB. Their mixes ensured that the crowd would continue to loosen up for the next big-name acts to come. Immediately, dance circles formed in every area. People took turns confidently showing their own flavors and styles to an encouraging, howling circle of supporters. Whether they were twerking, jerking, krumping or break-dancing, there were plenty of people featured on Snapchat.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After the DJ’s finished up their sets, IamSu!, a hot up-and-coming rapper representing the Bay Area, took the stage and shouted, “I CAME HERE TO HAVE A PARTY WITH Y’ALL, Y’ALL WANNA PARTY WITH ME?” He then started his hit song, “Rep That Gang,” and commanded the crowd to “Put your threes up!” The crowd yelled back, “SUZY!” and waved three fingers, breaking it down as IamSu! spit verse after verse.</p>\n<p>IamSu! pleased the crowd with more hit songs, such as “Function,” “Gas Pedal” and “Only That Real.” Despite adorations like “Aww, he looks like a teddy bear,” Suzy fiercely tore up the stage with hyped-up energy and rapping. When he finished, saddened fans repeatedly shouted his name for an encore, but a DJ came to cheer up them up, reminding them that Waka Flocka Flame was coming up next.</p>\n<p>Donning a white t-shirt with the words “Local Trap Star” plastered across his chest, Waka Flocka walked onto the stage, his braids flicking upwards with every step he took. Pointing to his camera crew, he told the audience to go crazy because “We about to film a movie! This shit gonn’ be on World Star!” Confused and excited faces greeted the cameras as the army of party animals tried to out-crazy one another.</p>\n<p>Throughout the night, the Brick Squad leader took turns changing the music between his usual hip hop songs and new EDM music. Regardless of the music he played, he made sure to interject “TURN UP!,” “BRICK SQUAD!” and “WAKA FLOCKA” throughout his songs. EDM was unexpected and the flock of fans was pleasantly surprised. When he told them, “I need everybody to count down to 10 with me and when the beat drop, turn the fuck up! I fuck with everybody in this,” everyone jumped up and raged with him.</p>\n<p>Waka Flocka Flame definitely had a presence. One moment people were moshing, and in another he came down off the stage and waddled through the sea of fans. People climbed over each other, trying to touch his locks or get a picture with him. Full disclosure: I was one of those people. I successfully got a video with him, spooning him from behind, as people grabbed my hair and pushed me in every direction possible. It was a near-death experience. I am not sure how he handled all those fans for so long, but his height might have helped.</p>\n<p>When he got back onstage, he continued to perform his hits, such as “No Hands” and “Hard in the Paint.” His squad was as crazy as him. They danced around onstage, shouted, sang into the mic and helped the artist turn up (even though he didn’t need any motivation). At one point, the trap star sang, “Turn up god: that’s what they call me!,” as a squad member tossed a little person to surf the crowd…twice!</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the party on the concert floor flooded onto the stage. Liz Ogawa, one of the many concert-goers who crazily danced on stage, commented, “It was crazy! One moment I was in the front row of the crowd and the next moment I was being lifted on stage. Some of my friends were up there too, so it was super fun to be dancing with Waka. I even took a selfie with him!” The concert ended with fanatics still on stage, turning up, dancing, stripping, snapchatting and shouting along to songs, such as “Bugatti,” “Round of Applause” and “No Type”.</p>\n<p>If I were to choose one word to sum up the concert, it would be wild. I’m not sure if it even should be called a concert. It was more like we were partying with IamSu!, Waka Flocka Flame and his brick squad. It was a function. A wild, freaky function with a plethora of “TURN UP!”, “BRICK SQUAD!,” “GO CRAZY!” and “FLOCKA!” ringing through my ears and running through my dancing veins.</p>\n<p>The energy in the room was explosive. It was definitely an interesting alternative experience from another night in Isla Vista. When the event ended, the crowd left: laughing about their near-death experiences, scrambling around looking for lost earrings and shirts, continuing to subconsciously mumble “FLOCKA! FLOCKA! FLOCKA!” and running to catch the bus home.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59211\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-partying-with-iamsu-waka-flocka-flame-brick-squad-at-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59211\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-partying-with-iamsu-waka-flocka-flame-brick-squad-at-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-partying-with-iamsu-waka-flocka-flame-brick-squad-at-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-partying-with-iamsu-waka-flocka-flame-brick-squad-at-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-17/concert-review-partying-with-iamsu-waka-flocka-flame-brick-squad-at-earl-warren-showgrounds/","id":7015,"author":{"id":752,"name":"Jennifer Kim"},"related":[7014,7013,7012],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brothas from Otha Mothas: Breaking Hearts, but Not Ears","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In 2011, “The Sing-Off” introduced us to Pentatonix.

In 2012, “Pitch Perfect” gave us the Barden Bellas. But in 2003, before a cappella broke through to the forefront of the music scene, two students named D.J. and Daniel came together to form UCSB’s only all-male a cappella group, Brothas from Otha Mothas.</p>\n<p>While their self-proclaimed goal of “breaking hearts” conjures up images of British boybands and 90s all-male pop groups, Brothas from Otha Mothas does not fully fit into that overly-done cookie-cutter mold — they actually just mock it. But what’s great about their play on the boyband archetype (complete with a serenade to a lucky female audience member and cheesy choreography), is that it’s funny.</p>\n<p>After all, we all know what it’s like to embarrassingly obsess over a band, and BFOM’s “almost-kind-of-boyband” image only brings back those memories. It makes them a relatable bunch. Sure, not all 16 members have curly hair and British accents, but BFOM certainly proved that their collective talent is enough to make a girl’s heart flutter at their concert on Nov. 22.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Opening for BFOM were UCSB’s other a capella groups: Naked Voices, InterVals and Vocal Motion. Each group could be easily identified by matching shirts printed with group logos. Sandwiched together to become a solid row of grooving bodies, the opening groups sang, danced and won the hearts of the audience. All stimulated the appetite for what was to come, as the sound of harmonious voices rang through Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>When BFOM’s turn to grace the stage arrived, the lights dimmed and the crowd cheered. Thirteen of the members stood side by side while another three stood rigidly in front with their fists at their sides, legs spread apart and their heads looking down. Something badass was about to happen. Something unexpected. Something to kick off their show on the right note.</p>\n<p>That something was “I Want It That Way” by The Backstreet Boys. By starting their show off with a boy band single that everyone jammed to in the 90s, their “breaking hearts” motto and their image as an “almost-kind-of-boyband” that enjoys “candlelit meals” and “long walks on the beach” (as stated on their website) was reinforced.</p>\n<p>However, Brothas from Otha Mothas proved themselves to be much more than your run-of-the-mill a capella group. Their third song, a cover of “What a Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong, was a homerun. Mason Sperling perfectly emulated Armstrong’s gravelly voice — and a trumpet. Truly, the variety of sounds that were reproduced by BFOM (from the chirp of birds to the sound of a crying baby) thoroughly entertained an enthralled crowd. Other covers that stood out were “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Withers (sung by one of the two gingers of the group who had just dominated a ginger dance battle) and good ol’ “Talk Dirty to Me” by Jason Derulo.</p>\n<p>As the show came to a close with “Take on Me” by A-ha, the crowd laughed, tapped their feet and clapped along. Entertaining and memorable, Brothas from Otha Mothas is a group definitely worth the five-dollar ticket fee. But if there was one thing I took away from the concert, it was a Christopher Walken joke. Showing off voice chops by mimicking Christopher Walken and throwing jokes back and forth in the signature deadpan style, one “Brotha” said, “I have this joke, but I forget the punchline… I just remember that it ends with eight Christophers <i>Walken</i> to a bar.”</p>\n<p><strong><br>\n<i>To get in touch with Brothas from Otha Mothas, find them on Facebook at </i><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BrothasFOM\">facebook.com/BrothasFOM</a>.  </strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59180\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-13/brothas-from-otha-mothas-breaking-hearts-but-not-ears/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59180\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-13/brothas-from-otha-mothas-breaking-hearts-but-not-ears/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-13/brothas-from-otha-mothas-breaking-hearts-but-not-ears/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-13/brothas-from-otha-mothas-breaking-hearts-but-not-ears/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-13/brothas-from-otha-mothas-breaking-hearts-but-not-ears/","id":7016,"author":{"id":732,"name":"Mackenzie Hart"},"related":[7015,7014,7013],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
