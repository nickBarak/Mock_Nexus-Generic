A goal from sophomore attacker Eric Van and de Mortel and another from Tomasello put UCSB right back in the lead beforean eventual 4-4 tie entering the second period.</p>\n<p>“We did a lot of things really well, but we had some break downs defensively on the counterattacks,” Van de Mortel said. “I think they ran their drop on the weak side well, but we were just missing a lot of our opportunities.”</p>\n<p>Early in the second quarter, Tomasello completed a hat trick with his third goal of the game. In the minutes just before halftime the 49ers added another goal, but UCSB answered with goals from junior attacker Matt Gronow and sophomore attacker Derek Shoemaker.</p>\n<p>“We had a strong first half, we got up in transition just about every time we got a stop, but we struggled to get stops on our five on six defense,”Derek Shoemaker said.</p>\n<p>Despite leading 7-6 at halftime, the Gauchos were held scoreless for the third quarter. The 49ers, on the other hand, received three goals to take a 9-7 lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Long Beach stormed out of the gate in the fourth quarter with three goals to prevent any chance of a UCSB comeback. Derek Shoemaker and Gronow would add late goals but the Gauchos ran out of time and lost 12-10.</p>\n<p>“I think for the most part we outplayed them, but once again our five man defense in the first half was pretty poor and then we let them score some easy goals down the stretch,” senior goalkeeper Myles Christian said. “Still a pretty disappointing loss, but fortunately it doesn’t affect our ranking or seed in the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Gronow and Tomasello led the Gauchos in scoring with three goals apiece and Christian recorded another double-digit save game with 12.</p>\n<p>In its next game, UCSB will travel to USC for the MPSF tournament to play the undefeated No. 1 Trojans in the first round on Friday.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 19th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48995\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-finish-mpsf-play-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48995\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-finish-mpsf-play-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-finish-mpsf-play-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-finish-mpsf-play-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/gauchos-finish-mpsf-play-loss/","id":5169,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[5168,5167,5166],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore","biography":"Not available","articles":[679,699,1785,2103,2115,2116,3183,3186,3187,3209,3214,4499,4540,5123,5153,5154,5155,5156,5157,5158,5159,5161,5163,5165,5166,5168,5169,5170,5171,5172],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Plays in Final Home Match Against Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 7 UCSB men’s water polo team hosts No. 6 Long Beach State this Saturday for their final regular season Mountain Pacific Sports Federation game of the year.

We have been in a slump and I know that this will be my last home game, so it would be nice to finish it off with a win.”</p>\n<p>With junior attacker Evan Dellinger — UCSB’s leading scorer with 42 — battling an injury, the Gauchos have had to find offensive production from other players. One player who has stepped us his game recently is sophomore attacker Eric Van de Mortel. Van de Mortel is now third on the team with 28 goals and has led UCSB in scoring the past three games.</p>\n<p>“I have been a little more aggressive in my attacking,” Van de Mortel said. “I have been practicing only shots I would take in games, while trying to think about the situation I am usually in. So like altering my shot as if someone is blocking even if there’s nobody there when I am practicing. Also, I have just been trying to work as hard as possible for these last few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Matt Gronow is another option.

With a win over Cal Poly on Friday as well, Long Beach continues to top the division with its 12-0 Big West and 22-4 overall record. CSUN also stepped it up this weekend, also recording a win over Cal Poly, which moved it back into fourth place with a 7-5 conference and 16-8 overall record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their game against Long Beach, the Gauchos dropped three sets 25-19, 25-18   and 25-17 on 49ers’ home court.

Both teams also recorded 91 total attempts and eight block assists, but the Matadors ability to take advantage of key situations put them over the top on their home court.</p>\n<p>“CSUN is a great offensive team, but we let them do exactly what we knew they wanted to do,” Barbeau said. “They also had a good defensive game against us, which I think we weren’t expecting. In the end, they really just out-worked us.”</p>\n<p>Big hitters for the Matadors were junior outside hitter Danetta Boykin and senior middle blocker Casey Hinger. Both players hit for 14 kills on Friday, Hinger swinging for a .435 hitting percentage and Boykin, .407. Along with Hinger’s 16.5 recorded points, she also went up for three of the team’s eight block assists.</p>\n<p>“We always expect teams to come out and play their best against us,” Klein said. “Especially towards the end of conference play, everyone is looking to win out and get revenge on different teams.”</p>\n<p>A standout player in Friday’s Gaucho offense was freshman outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, who swung for a .231 hitting percentage and a team high 11 kills and 12 points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will return home next weekend to play Hawaii on Friday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58346\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/gauchos-end-road-trip-on-losing-side/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58346\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/gauchos-end-road-trip-on-losing-side/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/gauchos-end-road-trip-on-losing-side/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/gauchos-end-road-trip-on-losing-side/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/gauchos-end-road-trip-on-losing-side/","id":5167,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[5166,5165,5164],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Going the Extra Mile","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When Myles Christian entered UCSB as a talented freshman, many expected greatness from him.

Five years later, those expectations have come to fruition, as the senior goalkeeper exits as one of the all-time great water polo players in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>Christian will be graduating this year after five years of consistent production and leadership. He leaves UCSB ranked fourth in career saves with 607, and his 238 saves in his senior season are fourth all-time for single season saves at UCSB. Also in his senior season, Christian finished third in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with 11.61 saves per game and posted a career-best 19 saves on Oct. 21 at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“That game was definitely the highlight of my career, it was fun,” Christian said. “I would also say beating Stanford and UCLA in the SoCal tournament as some of the highlights of my career.

As a senior and one of the most experienced players on the team, Christian was named a team captain along with fellow senior Brian Shoemaker.</p>\n<p>“As far as his leadership, Myles leads by example and people really want to be around him,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “He has such a great work ethic. I think it really rubs off on his teammates.”</p>\n<p>However, Christian’s college career did not begin with stardom right away. In 2008, his first year at UCSB, Christian redshirted and then shared playing time during his freshman and sophomore seasons with upperclassman Fraser Bunn.</p>\n<p>“It was a good experience; Fraser was a really good goalie and I learned a lot from him,” Christian said. “It was nice to not have all of the pressure on me right away.”</p>\n<p>In 2009, his freshman year of eligibility, Christian made six starts and tallied 84 saves. In a 10-9 overtime loss to Loyola Marymount, Christian collected 15 saves which was at the time a career best.</p>\n<p>“Myles is definitely a leader not only in the pool, but all around,” junior guard Dylan Baliani said. “He works hard at everything he does. It’s not so much of what he says, but [what] he does. He is the perfect example of a guy who leads by example.”</p>\n<p>In his sophomore season, Christian appeared in 18 games for UCSB and accumulated 115 saves with 18 steals. Then in 2011, Christian got the full starting job and posted 170 saves with 25 steals to lead the team.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a great feeling when you get the starting job. I felt like by [2011], I had enough experience, and it wasn’t too much pressure so I could enjoy it everyday,” Christian said.</p>\n<p>Before he was a Gaucho, Christian was a stand-out at Newport Harbor High School where he received countless awards and honors. As a senior, Christian led the Sailors to a CIF Division I championship and was named to First Team All-Sunset League, First Team All-County, First Team All- CIF Division I and First Team All-American. With all that success, Christian garnered a lot of attention from college coaches.</p>\n<p>“The two main schools I was looking at were UCSB and Long Beach State,” Christian said. “There was some interest in going to somewhere like UCLA or USC, but they had a few goalies already and UCSB was lacking in that area. Then I came up on my recruiting trip and just immediately fell in love, how could you not? In the end it was an easy choice.”</p>\n<p>The fact that UCSB was the “easy choice” for Myles has made a lot of teammates and Gaucho fans happy. Many of them were eager to offer their thoughts and respect for Myles, who impresses in everything he does.</p>\n<p>“Myles was probably the best goalie in the country this past year, most of the goals that he allowed were the result of missed shot blocks and defensive mistakes,” sophomore attacker Derek Shoemaker said. “He was also a great captain and leader. He set up various team activities to keep us out of trouble and he was usually in charge of getting our team dinners as well. It’s almost as if he was another coach.”</p>\n<p>In his life after UCSB, Christian will be leaving water polo behind but will still be making saves. However, these saves will not be of potential goals, but of human lives.</p>\n<p>“I’m graduating in the spring and right now I’m working as an EMT with the Santa Barbara County Fire Department so I’ll have that job until I graduate,” Christian said. “Then I am looking to stay up here and go to the fire academy and hopefully become a firefighter here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>In his final comments, Christian offered some lasting pieces of advice and leadership for the rest of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Work together, always support each other,” Christian said. “They have so much talent. They just need to work together, show up to practice everyday and work hard. They could be really successful next year if that happens.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 28, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/","id":5168,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[5167,5166,5165],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
