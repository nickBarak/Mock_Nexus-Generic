Ludicity’s proposal would provide an alternative festival to Deltopia. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial proposal of a festival led many UC Santa Barbara students and community members to believe that Lucidity’s event would completely shut down Deltopia, as expressed at the town hall. However, members of Lucidity’s board of directors negated these rumors and expressed its hopes that the alternative festival would develop a more positive, fun-filled environment that would help channel the Deltopia crowds into a safer space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not invested in doing this if people don’t want it,” Lucidity Director Ron Glover said. “We were asked to come and we decided we’d give it a shot… we don’t have a magic wand, but we’ve been successful at what we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has faced pushback from both sides of the community around its involvement in the event. Some UCSB students have expressed concern over parting with their beloved Deltopia tradition, while other Isla Vista residents present at the town hall noted they would prefer to abolish the event entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was [an] overwhelming response that students don’t want to see it rebranded,” Lucidity Founder and Marketing Director Jonah Gabriel Haas said. “It comes from an idea that this is going to change or take away their beloved Deltopia party, and that’s not what we’re trying to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its proposed Deltopia festival budget by $20,000, leaving it with a $159,850 price tag in order to get the program underway, which places special emphasis on harm reduction and collaboration with the community. This includes the unique concept of “Guardians,” a specially trained group of people dedicated to de-escalating situations to reduce the need for law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Guardian team would serve as a buffer between students and law enforcement so that the vast majority of things, whether they be medical or conflicts, can be de-escalated, mediated and taken care of before escalating to law enforcement,” Haas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the town hall, many concerned community members placed an emphasis on their fear of outsiders coming into I.V. and wreaking havoc with no sense of personal responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haas noted that Lucidity’s goal is “to make the event awesome enough for crowds to come off Del Playa, but not so awesome that we attract huge out-of-town crowds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team hopes to accomplish this by enlisting local artists to play at two different stages in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and People’s Park, which will hopefully encourage students to enjoy the music without drawing in outsiders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity also explained its hopes for a more family-friendly event in the future. However, the team acknowledged that since this is the first iteration of the event, they wanted to prioritize the age range that the original Deltopia appealed to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, UCSB’s A.S. Program Board commissioner, expressed her fears that Lucidity’s event would take away from the Program Board’s Warm Up event, which aims to act as a safe space that provides live music, drinks, snacks and other necessities to potentially inebriated students after Deltopia. She explained that after Deltopia and a Lucidity Festival, students might be too tired to attend the school-sanctioned nighttime event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also raised concern regarding the price tag, which the I.V. Community Services District explained would be covered by the district and other organizations who could potentially support the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that I think trying stuff is important and you won’t know… but it’s a $159,000 try,” Morrison said. “Can you justify spending that much on this event, rather than medical tents, drug testing, water or food that could help Deltopia in another way?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Lucidity returned to the point made at the beginning of the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If this works, it works, and we couldn’t ask for anything better,” Glover said. “If it doesn’t, we won’t do it again… instead of not trying, and saying what if it doesn’t work, well, what if it does?”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

With mostly losses intertwined between the minority victories, the Aggies are certainly hoping for a better result in their games against the Gauchos before the end of the team’s current homestand.</p>\n<p>Jack Dashwood looks to be the probable starter for UCSB on Friday’s opening match and the southpaw will be making a start at a point in the season where he has run into more trouble than he’d like to have seen as of late.</p>\n<p>The freshman has a 2-5 record on the year and his previous start to begin the series against UC Irvine was his worst outing on the mound all season. The 18.90 ERA and ten hits allowed over 3.1 innings pitched are all season-low marks in each category.</p>\n<p>Dashwood had been getting it together before his disastrous start against UCI, since the March 9th game against Texas State he had gone for at least five innings, allowed a less than 1.50 ERA, excluding a March 19th start, and held a 2-3 record. The lefty and his team are hoping he can bounce back to set a strong tone early in the series against Davis.</p>\n<p>Junior Ryan Anderson leads UC Davis in batting average, (.391), hits (50), and runs (26) alongside junior Caleb van Blake, who leads the team in RBIs with 28, have been major parts of the Aggie offense.</p>\n<p>In Davis’ last 16-10 victory, both Anderson and van Blake homered in the game with van Blake’s shot being a huge grand slam in the third inning to tie up the score.</p>\n<p>For a team who has not done a lot of winning this season, in the games, the Aggies have won offense has not been a problem as all of their victories have come when the team has scored seven or more runs.</p>\n<p>The key to victory for the Gauchos this series very well could lie in keeping the Aggies guessing at the plate and getting good pitching to keep them quiet.</p>\n<p>The team has a good coincidence of timing as early opportunities to jump ahead in the standings do not come often and the mindset for UCSB must be to come out strong should they desire to quickly improve their record.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will begin their series against the Aggies on Friday, April 20 – April 23.

Seven different Gaucho pitchers would appear in the game each allowing 1+ earned run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Freshman Chris Troye would pitch the Gauchos from the ninth inning until the top of the eleventh before giving up a single. Sophomore Ben Brecht replaced Troye and gave up a three-run home run to Highlander Anthony Lepre. With the first runner scored being Troye’s responsibility, the freshman would get tagged with the loss.</p>\n<p>CSU Bakersfield’s last series was on a road trip to Washington to play Seattle University where the team lost 4-10. The Redhawks victory in the final match was their second consecutive and gave the team the series win. The Roadrunners struggled to match the Redhawks offensive success and starter Nick Meservey kept Bakersfield scoreless his entire outing. Junior Ryan Koch, who leads the team in RBIs on the year, went 0-4 in the game.</p>\n<p>Junior Noah Barba and freshman Daniel Carrizosa stayed hot in the series as each got a hit and RBI in the game. Hits, runs, and batting average team leader Andrew Penner was another Roadrunner with an RBI. The .341 average hitter has been a consistent and dangerous offensive threat for the Roadrunners and will be a problem for the Gauchos’ pitching rotation.</p>\n<p>Despite making a huge impact early on in the Riverside series, sophomore Tommy Jew and junior Clay Fisher quieted down a bit in their final game gathering a combined three hits. The three hit total is an average outcome compared to Fisher’s perfect day at the plate the day before and Jew’s four hit two RBI performance the day before that.</p>\n<p>The dynamic duo have been the Gauchos’ top two offensive producers on the season with the two occupying the top places in the major offensive categories. Williams has been getting hot as of late as the freshman has shown an ability to get key hits for his team that result in runs on the board.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunner pitching staff which struggled much like the Gauchos’ against Riverside will be looking to bounce back against Fisher, Jew, and the others.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still .500 in the Big West Conference, having a record of six wins and six losses. The record is enough to put them at fourth in the conference and will be a good preview game as CSU Bakersfield will be joining the Gauchos in the Conference in 2022.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/","id":4274,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4273,4272,4271],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
