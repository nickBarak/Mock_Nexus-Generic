The event included poetry readings, music, art, games, t-shirt making and art projects.</p>\n<p>Editors from <em>Feministing.com</em> Lori Adelman and Jos Truitt spoke at the event about what constitutes feminism.  Adelman said feminism might cause strife between genders as power dynamics change.</p>\n<p>“When we’re talking about feminist goals, we’re not necessarily talking about a zero-sum game,” Adelman said. “There are some things that we are asking, telling and demanding that men and people who have been operating under the privilege of patriarchy give up. And it’s not something they can do without maybe some direct personal loss.”</p>\n<p>According to Adelman, feminism is not a friendly request, but a demand for what is owed to an individual.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t us asking for you to do us a favor and be nice and from the bottom of your heart or to be kind and give us these small feminist wins,” Adelman said. “We’re asking and demanding power. It’s not always going to be an amicable relationship.”</p>\n<p>At sunset, attendees marched through I.V. with signs labeled “Slut shame is victim blame” and “My body is mine.” After the march, attendees regrouped at Anisq’Oyo’ Park for a “survivor circle” to share personal thoughts and stories about sexual violence.</p>\n<p>Take Back the Night Co-chair and third-year feminist studies and English double major and Kelty Kauffman said females are constantly on edge when they are out in the streets after dark.</p>\n<p>“It’s scary going out at night,” Kauffman said. “When you’re someone who’s not a straight white dude, going out at night means doing a checklist in your mind of things that could go wrong, figuring out how to keep yourself safe.”</p>\n<p>According to Kauffman, this year’s event saw a new, wider range of emotions compared to last year’s.</p>\n<p>“This year’s event had a lot of heart,” Kauffman said. “There were a lot of tears and there was a lot of healing, but there was also a lot of laughter, which is not something that I’ve experienced in these spaces before, and that felt really, really good. We were okay to laugh. It was allowed. People were allowed to express themselves however they needed to.”</p>\n<p>Kauffman said the organization aims to empower women in order to gain the same privileges as men.</p>\n<p>“The phrase ‘take back the night’ means taking back our autonomy, our ability to leave the house, our ability to do things like a regular person would, and by regular I mean straight white dudes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said after she was sexually assaulted last year, survivor resources at UCSB advised her against taking the case to court against her wishes. According to Melgoza, Judicial Affairs claimed the case would not make it to court, and if it did, she would not win.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately I only got to enjoy my college experience one quarter here at UCSB,” Melgoza said. “Survivors all have different ways of healing and coping … There’s not a single label or stereotype but unfortunately, Judicial Affairs wanted me to fit a mold. I had to persist and literally argue with them through phone calls, emails and appointments. I had to make sure they were doing their job.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Maya Trifunovic said the event was informative and ensured the topic of rape remained relevant.</p>\n<p>“We still live in a rape culture,” Trifunovic said. “There’s a lot of conversations that I think especially people our age need to be having about the society we want to build as we go out into it. I think it’s a good space and really educated people with a lot of resources and ideas about how to fix that.”</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger said there is more to sexual violence than the victim and the perpetrator, and “sexism encourages rape culture.”</p>\n<p>“There’s so much that plays into sexual assault. I think people tend to look at it as a person to person thing, like it’s an individual perpetrator’s problem,” Ballinger said. “But really, it’s a result of people giving their tacit approval.”</p>\n<p>According to Ballinger, events such as Take Back the Night remind community members and survivors that they are not alone.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important that survivors know that other people care,” Ballinger said, “and that there’s awareness about it. Being here is educational. It helps me learn more about what’s really going on and things under the surface.”</p>\n<p>Ballinger said sexual assault is more common than most students realize.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody knows someone who is a survivor,” Ballinger said. “You could be sitting in lecture and the person next to you could be a survivor and you wouldn’t know. People just don’t know that they know survivors.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and global studies double major Presly Mellor said “taking back the night” means women should not have to live in fear.</p>\n<p>“I see it very literally where we take back the night,” Mellor said, “where we, as women, can walk freely without feeling threatened, without feeling the need to look over our shoulder multiple times on a walk back home at night, I don’t have to worry about being too drunk or having to walk down a dark street.”</p>\n<p>According to Mellor, she hopes the organization will continue its fight to end sexual violence and assault.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s really empowering to see what younger students are organizing and leading because I’m on my way out, but I still want this work to be done,” Mellor said. “It’s really nice to hear that first-, second- and third-years are going to be dedicated to this cause the rest of their time at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Mellor said though participation rates have not changed since she attended in 2013, the diversity of participants has greatly increased.</p>\n<p>“There’s been a change in the people coming which I think is good, because it shows that more people are interested and different kinds of people, all different majors, different years,” Mellor said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

After a walk, and a base hit by senior catcher Campbell Wear, a hit by pitch loaded the bases. An RBI base hit by Calica brought home Campbell as the go-ahead run. The Gauchos’ second run scored that inning went down as an unearned run on a BYU passed ball.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a good time to sit back on a pitch that I could handle well. It’s awesome to see that we had some good team at bats earlier that inning,” Calica said. “Good things happen when you get lead off guys on.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore right-handed pitcher Shane Bieber allowed only three hits and one run while striking out nine in eight innings pitched in his season debut during Saturday’s late game. Combined with ninth-inning sub-in, junior right-handed pitcher James Carter, the team allowed BYU only four hits.</p>\n<p>“It was a weird situation going in with a double-header, but I went in there trying to treat it as a normal start,” Bieber said. “I tried to get comfortable with my pitches as I went on, and I ended up getting more and more comfortable with each inning.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in Saturday’s morning 6-0 shutout, junior right-handed closer Dillon Tate started in place of junior lefty Domenic Mazza, allowing three hit and no runs, with eight recorded strikeouts in 25 batters faced through 6.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Tate’s usually our closer, but he really did a good job,” Checketts said. “He was really in control of that game. He had a great start and was dominant for those innings.”</p>\n<p>At the plate, UCSB’s lineup swung for twelve hits and six runs scored. Junior designated hitter Robby Nesovic recorded two of the teams four total RBIs, with three hits and one run scored. Redshirt senior second baseman Woody Woodward and senior catcher Campbell Wear made up the other two RBIs with one a piece.</p>\n<p>“We were good early, but they’ve given us a lot [of runs] defensively. Even today, they gave us one on a pass ball,” Checketts said. “We’re going to have to earn more of our runs, than have them give them to us.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s season opener, the Gauchos kicked off their winning weekend in front of a crowd of 411 attendants. UCSB allowed twelve hits turning into only one run for the Cougars, as the Gauchos capitalized for eight runs on 10 hits from across the lineup.</p>\n<p>The teams had Sunday off after Saturday’s double-header to prepare for today’s game. With the threat of going home empty handed in its first series, BYU must improve on its four errors made in the past three games.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure the guys will come out and run around on their own to make sure that they’re ready,” Checketts said. “The big thing is it Domenic Mazza will be able to throw for us.

Clinic building to discuss the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) to facilitate self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), introduced in December to create a CSD for I.V. by act of the state legislature, will be amended to include more detailed plans for the proposed special district before it will be voted on. Tuesday’s meeting was part of a series of meetings that have been hosted by Williams to establish and clarify the bill’s language regarding the creation of a CSD. During this Tuesday’s meeting, stakeholders discussed the extent to which students should be allowed to be involved in self-governance, whether or not county representatives should be on an I.V. governing board and the events of last weekend’s Deltopia festivities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said he is in favor of having self-governance representatives from both the university and the county holding positions on a governing board for the CSD.</p>\n<p>“I want the cooperation of UCSB and the county. Basically, I want their advice,” Schunk said. “That’s a big part of it for me. There are a lot of complicated things that we want to do with this CSD and I think that both entities have expressed that they might be comfortable with an ex officio seat.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and long-time I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said any group with an interest in I.V. governance can run a candidate for the board.</p>\n<p>“If there’s other entities … that have a real concern about what’s happening at that level, they’re going to find a candidate and they’re going to put their support behind that candidate,” Soutar said. “That is the electoral process and I don’t know if we need to make it super complicated.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD board member and fourth-year global studies major Jacob Lebell said the university and county’s support will be necessary to form a governing board.</p>\n<p>“In the position we are in now, we need both the county and the university to have support for the board,” Lebell said. “Our interests are not always going to be aligned with it but we need their support for the board to come into existence.”</p>\n<p>Esther Aguilera, Representative for Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr, said Farr’s stance on the proposed governing board will not be stated until Williams’ final version of the self-governance bill is signed into law.</p>\n<p>“What I see is her [Farr] waiting until the government signs it [AB3],” Aguilera said. “When that’s signed she will decide whether to endorse it or not. I think as it stands right now she’s undecided.”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said the two organizations he is a member of, the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee and the UCSB Foundation Board of Trustees, are in favor of I.V. self-governance, but are awaiting to see what the final plans are before endorsing the stakeholders’ plans.</p>\n<p>“Those two very big players at the university are committed to a process that brings greater self-governance for Isla Vista,” Thurlow said. “What’s not clear I think is, ‘What is that? What form does that take?’ And we’re still not sure what exactly the chancellor can do vis-à-vis a piece of legislation. There’s still some huge questions that aren’t answered. … Finances and boundaries and board makeup.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman said he is frustrated with the university and county’s allegedly non-committal attitudes.</p>\n<p>“We’re all being asked these questions: ‘What boundaries do you want? What board representation do you want?’ We’re all providing our opinions, in some cases impassioned arguments,” Freeman said. “But the university and the county … are in some ways not participating in the process that we’re having right now because they’re simply saying, ‘I’m waiting for you all to come up with what you want and I’ll say yes or no.’”</p>\n<p>In the discussion on the differences between this year’s Deltopia compared to last year’s riots, Schunk said the reduction of crowds by half and the number of medical transports dropping from 50 in 2014 to only nine this year is evidence that I.V. residents are taking charge of the event.</p>\n<p>“I think what we proved to them is that we can add our own structure to the event and the community can really come together and take charge of some portions of it,” Schunk said. “Over time I’m hoping the police force can be reduced and the police feel it is less of a necessity to be here.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and second-year history of public policy major Paola De La Cruz said she noticed a difference in the amount of trash on I.V. streets during the cleanup process the day after Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“When we went out to clean for Adopt-A-Block compared to last year the amount of trash that was on DP and other streets was just, like, ‘Oh my gosh, did Deltopia even happen?’” De La Cruz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62133\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62133\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/stakeholders-continue-to-discuss-self-governance/","id":4719,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4718,4717,4716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Baseball Finishes Off Opening Series With Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150213_baseball_vsBYU_01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150213_baseball_vsBYU_01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB finished off a four-game sweep of BYU thanks to an early run cushion and a combined pitching performance in Monday's game.
