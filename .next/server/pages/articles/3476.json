In addition to being the first Executive Dean, Marshall has served on various campus organizations such as the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on Budget Strategy and the Chancellor’s Advisory Council on Campus Climate. He has also helped found UCSB’s COLLABORATE, an organization that promotes effective use of technologies as a support for instruction.</p>\n<p>Marshall said his previous experience as the Dean of Humanities and UCSB’s interdisciplinary and collaborative culture have allowed him to become involved in many partnerships with other schools and academic divisions as well as deal with issues such as budget, space planning and enrollment. As an active member of UC committees and programs, Marshall said he plans to work with students, alumni and administration on education while also focusing more specifically on issues in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to working with the UCSB community to develop an academic plan that will allow us to fulfill our mission as a leading research university dedicated to education and public service.” Marshall said in an email. “In addition, I will be working closely with the Chancellor as we take important steps to address the problems associated with Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Dean of the College of Letters and Science Melvin Oliver, who has worked closely with Marshall, said the College of Letters and Science will continue collaboration with Marshall on various initiatives and challenges that affect the CLS.</p>\n<p>“Some of the main areas we’ll address in the coming year are the quality and diversity of our faculty; adapting to the changing instructional environment that includes online and hybrid classes; and ensuring that we are able to offer enough courses for students to have timely completion of their degree objectives,” Oliver said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he created the EVC Search Advisory Committee with consultation from various other committees such as Academic Senate Committee on Committees, Associated Students and Graduate Students Association for membership. He said the committee hired an executive search firm to help decide from dozens of applications.</p>\n<p>“The history of his leadership and service to our campus is both broad and deep. I was pleased and excited that Dr. Marshall assumed the new EVC position,” Yang said in an email. Marshall said he was humbled to have been selected from such a talented pool of applicants for the position.</p>\n<p>“I am sure that there were many strong candidates and I am honored to have been selected.” Marshall said in an email.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/ucsb-committee-elects-former-dean-as-new-evc-2/","id":3476,"author":{"id":329,"name":"Heeba Kaleem"},"related":[3475,3474,3473],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":329,"name":"Heeba Kaleem","biography":"Not available","articles":[3476,7604,7607],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Senate Passes Bill to Prevent Gun Violence, Sent to Brown","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The California State Senate unanimously passed Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s bill to prevent gun violence last Friday, and the bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown, who must approve the bill by Se...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_55991\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55991\" data-attachment-id=\"55991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/jackson_ben/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=1447%2C932&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1447,932\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Database\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T1i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1400962866\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Jackson_Ben\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=888%2C572&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-55991 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben-1024x659.jpg?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"Following the tragic shooting that took place in I.V. on May 23, the bill was introduced.

The purpose of the bill is to assure that law enforcement has adequate information when responding to welfare calls.</p></div>\n<p>The California State Senate unanimously passed Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s bill to prevent gun violence last Friday, and the bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown, who must approve the bill by Sept. 30 for it to become law.</p>\n<p>The bill was introduced following the events of the May 23 Isla Vista mass shootings which killed six people, three of gunshot wounds, by SBCC student Elliot Rodger. Three weeks prior to the shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted Rodger as part of a welfare check at his parent’s request but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. SB 505 requires law enforcement agencies across the state to develop and implement policies encouraging officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms System prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, the purpose of the bill is to ensure that law enforcement has adequate information at their disposal when responding to welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill would help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Senator Jackson’s communications director Lisa Gardiner, while welfare checks can be conducted by law enforcement for various reasons, SB 505 only applies to calls where “there is a concern the person may be in danger to themselves or others.”</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover said. According to Hoover, deputies responding to the April 30 call for Rodger did not feel the need to consult the register based on their interaction with him at the time, and were thus unaware he possessed any firearms.</p>\n<p>Hoover also said deputies are empowered to ask individuals possessing weapons to voluntarily forfeit them during a welfare check but that responding to such calls alone does not permit the sheriff’s office to simply seize weapons.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said. “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60 to 90 days.”</p>\n<p>The Automated Firearms System will prove to be beneficial by virtue of making knowledge more accessible to law enforcement, which Amanda Wilcox of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in California said will put law enforcement “in a better position to protect their own safety” because “the more knowledge they have about what guns to expect the more they’re in a better position to protect their own safety.”</p>\n<p>“It’s an officer safety issue,” Wilcox said. “A lot of resources have gone into having the kind of database we have in California and we, including law enforcement, should be taking full advantage of that information.”</p>\n<p>The bill has received the support of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the California Police Chief’s Association. The latter group, according to Gardiner, lobbied for the bill to enable local law enforcement agencies to design policies on how law enforcement officers would consult the Automated Firearms Systems database.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, August 27, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Photo by Kenneth Song//<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Regents of the University of California held their last meeting of the summer at the UCSF Mission Bay Community Center last Wednesday and Thursday, where they appointed a new UC Irvine chancellor, discussed future plans regarding UC finances and received recommendations for the sexual assault task force recently created by UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>During public comment, speakers addressed the Regents about issues such as the UC’s investments in fossil fuel companies as well as University efforts to respond to sexual assault on campuses.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Napolitano discussed the UC investment portfolio and gave updates on the UC-Mexico Initiative and the UC Global Food Initiative. The University Committee on Educational Policy presented initial recommendations from the sexual assault task force and then discussed partnerships at UC Davis to advance food and health research.</p>\n<p>Educational Policy Committee Chair Regent Bonnie Reiss said the task force would continue its work into the next year and quickly draft a plan to implement its recommendations by July 2015.</p>\n<p>“As Regents we take very seriously our role as stewards of UC. We care about maintaining our role as the premier research institution on the planet,” Reiss said. “As important as this mission is, providing a safe environment is every bit as important, perhaps more important.”</p>\n<p>Members of the sexual assault task force included UC Senior Vice President Sheryl Vacca and fourth-year international development studies major UCLA Savannah Badalich, both of whom discussed task force goals before presenting seven overarching recommendations to the board.</p>\n<p>The recommendations included the creation of consistent a “response team model” at all campuses with separate focuses on reporting and prevention education; system-wide standard investigation and adjudication standards; a system-wide training and education plan for students, staff and faculty; community education about UC programs; creation of an independent confidential advocacy office for sexual violence on each campus; a system-wide website customized for each campus to provide students with resources regarding sexual assault; and a “standardized data set” leveraging existing sexual violence data, to report data in a consistent manner, with agreed upon definitions.</p>\n<p>Badalich said student respondents played a large role in generating some of the recommendations, especially the recommendation to establish an independent confidential advocacy office and the system-wide, campus-customized website.</p>\n<p>“Many students on campuses don’t know who to go to, who they can talk to about their assault without having to give a mandatory report,” Badalich said, speaking from personal experience. “After my assault I Googled ‘sexual assault at UCLA’ and the many different websites confused me, so one website would be very effective.”</p>\n<p>Badalich also emphasized how sexual assault prevention education and alcohol abuse education should not be “conflated” in new student orientation presentations and said that all faculty and staff should be required to participate in “survivor centered” sensitivity training.</p>\n<p>According to Reiss, the system-wide standardization of penalties and minimum responses following a guilty verdict in the university adjudication of a sexual assault case will be further assessed in Phase II of the task force’s work. Badalich also said the task force would keep itself open to additional recommendations in the work it does in Phase II.</p>\n<p>The Regents then convened the Committee on Finance and discussed the UC’s energy service programs to achieve climate neutrality in a presentation given by newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom and UCOP Vice President of Budget and Capital Resources Patrick J. Lenz.</p>\n<p>According to Brostrom, widespread efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are taking place across campuses, with each university cutting its emissions down to the same levels they were in 2000, as per University climate policy. Brostrom also said the UC is examining ways to reduce greenhouse gas output by eventually transitioning from burning natural gas to burning biomethane, with proposals on such efforts to come as early as the November Regent’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Brostrom and Lenz also overviewed the budget for the current fiscal year before discussing preliminary budget priority recommendations for the 2015-16 fiscal year. Among the preliminary recommendations for the priorities of the next fiscal year were a minimum of $120 to $130 million in mandatory costs, a minimum $195 million in high-priority costs and $50 million in “quality reinvestment” costs to increase graduate student support, reduce the student-faculty ratio and reduce faculty and staff salary gaps, among other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to a memo from UCOP to the Committee on Finance, the $120 million in mandatory costs are unavoidable costs that must be covered before other high-priority costs or initiatives can be funded. Lenz said if Governor Jerry Brown maintains his four percent increase in the UC’s general fund as part of his multi-year education funding plan — an amount of about $119 million — that revenue could “just fall short” of covering the proposed mandatory costs.</p>\n<p>Following the presentation, Regent Richard Blum said he is dissatisfied with what he described as the state’s “continuous” underfunding of the UC system.</p>\n<p>“We are now educating 78,000 more students with the same amount of money … than we did 25 years ago,” Blum said. “How do we do it? Larger class sizes, not a good thing. Greater tuitions, let buildings run down … there’s hardly a month goes by that I don’t hear about some dean or some chancellor worried about losing yet another good person because of a much better offer.”</p>\n<p>According to Blum, “corruption” in Sacramento is due to the UC’s current funding issues.</p>\n<p>“We at the University get the short stick,” Blum said. “We’re gonna turn this place into a community college if we keep going the way we are … after watching all this for all these years, I’m tired of it.”</p>\n<p>According to the slides of the Lenz presentation, between fiscal years 1990-91 and 2014-15, state funding for the UC grew 31 percent while inflation grew 80 percent. The UC also enrolled over 82,000 more students.</p>\n<p>The Regents then approved a $297 million dollar package to fund 15 capital improvement projects, mostly related to infrastructure and “seismic/life safety needs” as part of the 2015-16 budget for state capital improvements. One proposed project included $15 million in seismic work on UCSB’s Campbell Hall, subject to further review at the November Regents meeting.</p>\n<p>Prior to convening the Committee on Investments, the Regents heard from Jefferson Kuoch-Seng, a fourth-year management major at UC Merced and newly elected UCSA President who discussed the continuation of the IGNITE campaign, aiming to “dismantle the school to prison pipeline” as well as the recently announced UConsent campaign against sexual assault and sexual violence. Kuoch-Seng also spoke against tuition increases despite what he described as the UC’s “budget shortfall”.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Investments then heard a discussion item from UCOP Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bachher on the status of the UC’s investment portfolio in the last fiscal year. According to slides presented during Bachher’s presentation, the UC’s total assets under management grew almost 15 percent in the last fiscal year, increasing $78.4 billion to some $90 billion, described as an “all-time high.” The UC’s investments, according to Bachher, are approximately 70 percent in North America, with 10 billion dollars in Asia, and five percent in “emerging markets,” with roughly half the total assets invested in the stock market and 20 percent and 30 percent in alternative assets and fixed income sources, respectively.</p>\n<p>After lengthy discussion, the Regents also approved the establishment of UC Ventures, an independent fund to pursue investments in companies that use UC research, subject to approval of the Regents with an initial amount of $250 million to get started.</p>\n<p>“Its pretty clear that there are opportunities, they have been profitable for investors and they exist within our organization,” Bachher said. “It is a new way to finance and benefit from innovation within the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Regent Blum said he thought it would be difficult to attract investors away from private companies in the Bay Area and cautioned Bachher on the proposal.</p>\n<p>“Other universities have done it but … you are entering into a long hard struggle and I would be very surprised if you come back three or four years from now and you will have made any money at all,” Blum said.</p>\n<p>The President’s Task Force on Sustainable Investing also presented recommendations to the Regents on implementing sustainable investment practices. Bachher specifically addressed the demands of the student-led Fossil Free UC Campaign.</p>\n<p>Task force member Bachher said he recognized efforts made by Fossil Free UC toward fossil fuel divestment and said that of the UC’s $90 billion dollar investment portfolio, roughly 10 percent of it is anchored in energy investments. According to Bachher, divesting from companies in the top 200 of emitters would result in a divestment of $3 billion, while cutting coal investments alone would equate to a $500 million dollar divestment.</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion recommending the establishment and implementation of a framework on sustainable investment to be completed by June 2015 that integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a core component of “portfolio optimization.” The board allocated $1 billion over five years to investment pursuits in renewable power and fuels as well as in energy efficiency, among other possibilities.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Compliance then presented to the board several discussion items on the internal auditing activities conducted at all UC locations between July and August, as well as a presentation by UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks on recent NCAA rule changes and their impact on the PAC-12 conference, of which UCLA and UC Berkeley are members.</p>\n<p>During the Thursday morning session the Regents appointed Howard Gillman as UC Irvine’s sixth chancellor following the departure of former Chancellor Michael V. Drake, who has been serving as Ohio State University’s president since June.</p>\n<p>Gillman previously served as the provost and executive vice chancellor, and was interim chancellor for the Irvine campus since January. According to Napolitano, Gilman was selected after a four month national search from a pool of some 405 prospective candidates. The board also approved a $485,000 compensation package for Gillman.</p>\n<p>Chair of the Board of Regents Bruce Varner praised Gilman’s leadership ability and dedication during the appointment.</p>\n<p>“Strong leadership is central to the excellence of each of our 10 campuses,” Varner said in a UCOP statement. “Chancellor Gillman has demonstrated he has the leadership attributes, the vision and the dedication to public service needed to move UC Irvine forward with vigor and integrity.”</p>\n<p>Gillman gave a brief address following his confirmation by the Regents. Following Gillman’s remarks, the Regents reconvened the Committee on Compensation and passed an action item to develop a policy to keep the compensation of UC chancellors competitive compared to “peer institutions.”</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion to raise the pay of four UC chancellors who are among the lowest paid chancellors in the UC system, including UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The motion’s approval of increased Yang’s pay by roughly 20 percent, from $324,450 to $389,340.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal and UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland also had their compensation packages raised 20 percent with the passage of the motion. A five percent increase was also given to UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox in the same motion.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Health Services was then convened and heard a discussion on the current financial status of the UCSF Medical Center and its soon-to-open Mission Bay Hospital, as well as a discussion on the needs of each campus to address student mental health. Regent William De La Pena requested further investigation of mental health needs of students across UC campuses and asked for a more detailed report to be presented at the Regent’s November meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-23/uc-regents-finish-up-summer-with-finances-appointments-task-forces/","id":3474,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3473,3472,3471],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Twenty Years of Yang","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"He has advised the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, NASA and the National Science Foundation.

Daily Nexus File Photo.</p></div>\n<p>He has advised the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>This past year, he finished his term as an elected chairman of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, which includes 45 of the top research universities across four continents surrounding and within the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>Since 2007, he has been the chairman of the Thirty Meter Telescope project, a partnership between the University of California, Caltech and institutions across the globe working to build a telescope 30 meters in diameter in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. He has also guided nine UCSB Ph.D. candidates with research grants from the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, he has served on the President’s Committee for the National Medal of Science, a U.S. presidential appointment that recommends winners from a pool of nominees to the President of the United States. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Society for Engineering Education and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.</p>\n<p>And for the last 20 years, he has served as chancellor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Henry T. Yang was invited to become UCSB’s fifth chancellor in 1994 after leaving his position as dean of the Schools of Engineering at Purdue University.</p>\n<p>“I was honored and pleased to be invited to UC Santa Barbara as … chancellor,” Yang said in an email. “To build a pre-eminent world-class research university with excellence and diversity and with the fulfillment of its responsibilities of teaching, research, and service is a mission that will never end.”</p>\n<p>Yang received his bachelor’s degree from National Taiwan University and his Ph.D. from Cornell. According to the Office of the Chancellor, he specializes in aerospace structures, structural dynamics, composite materials, finite elements, transonic aeroelasticity, wind and earthquake structural engineering and intelligent manufacturing systems.</p>\n<p>Yang said he took the job with aspirations of continuing and strengthening the university’s tradition of academic excellence and called the job “exciting and rewarding.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the number of freshman applications has quadrupled from 17,000 in 1994 to 66,800 this year, while the GPA of the entering class has risen from 3.47 to 3.98 in that same period. Earlier this month, U.S. News and World Report ranked UCSB as one of the nation’s top ten public universities.</p>\n<p>Former Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud said Yang has played a vital role in intensifying the university’s prestige.</p>\n<p>“Because of him we went from being a backwater UC in 1994 to being one of the top research universities in the world,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of the reasons he has remained with UCSB include the university’s election to the Association of American Universities, with five UCSB faculty members and one alumnus winning Nobel Prizes. With characteristic humility, he credits everyone who attends, works at or otherwise contributes to UCSB as grounds for its success.</p>\n<p>“With the vision and hard work of our faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, and supporters, I have had the tremendous honor and joy of witnessing the exciting growth of UC Santa Barbara,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Abboud, who worked closely with Yang during his time as A.S. president, said although he and the chancellor did not “agree 100 percent on everything,” both shared a mutual respect, especially after dealing with the tumultuous events of last Spring.</p>\n<p>“Well I don’t have experience with any other chancellor, but I do know that he has students at the top of his list of priorities,” Abboud said. “If people had a sit-in in his office, instead of run away like other administrators at other campuses do, he would talk to students and try to solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Aside from his administrative responsibilities, Yang also teaches a structural engineering once a year to 50 undergraduates in the College of Engineering. Though Yang holds many accolades under his belt, he said his distinguished teaching award from the UCSB Academic Senate is the award he holds most dear.</p>\n<p>“I see him involved a lot,” third-year biology and communication double major Caitlin Weis said. “It seems like he’s more involved with the community than most chancellors.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Mechanical Engineering Department Francesco Bullo said Yang “has a ton of experience, infinite wisdom and positive energy” and for this reason is happy to have him in the department.<br>\n“I believe our students love working with him and learning from him,” Bullo said in an email. “He’s always ready with a word of advice and encouragement, and he’s so organized and knowledgeable.”<br>\nIndeed, Yang said he is happy to be chancellor.</p>\n<p>“I am so honored and pleased to serve UC Santa Barbara, and to witness it growing steadily and exponentially in excellence, diversity, and world-class stature,” he said. “I look forward to many years of working with our faculty, students, staff, and alumni, and to continuing our exciting journey together.”</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <i>Daily Nexus.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/","id":3475,"author":{"id":191,"name":"Hannah Nelson"},"related":[3474,3473,3472],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
