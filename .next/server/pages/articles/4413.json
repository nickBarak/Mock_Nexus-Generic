Supporters climbed a ladder on the side of the Co-op building to see the newly installed panels on the roof. Afterward, groups celebrated by cutting a giant ribbon with a pair of scissors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco-based nonprofit RE-volv started the Solar Ambassador Program as a way to help organizations and businesses switch to renewable energy. The one-year program takes college students and trains them in finance, management, crowdfunding and community engagement in a four-day retreat in Tomales Bay near San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andreas Karelas, executive director of RE-volv, said the ceremony was a way of raising awareness about renewable energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A project like this and a ribbon-cutting like this is [sic] really meant to show all the customers that come here, all the community members, all the students in Isla Vista at Santa Barbara, that solar power works,” Karelas said. “It saves the Co-op money, it can save you money and it’s something that we could all get behind and get involved with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Solar Ambassador team started their project in 2015. After signing the lease with the Co-op in the fall, the team raised $59,261 in donations during a crowdfunding campaign in the spring of 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Godfrey, a fourth-year environmental studies major and one of the solar ambassadors, said she’s happy that the project is finished.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited to see everything come to a close,” Godfrey said. “My favorite thing about the project was seeing the love and support that the community has for the Co-op. You don’t really see that until you tell them about something and then their face lights up, and it’s really awesome to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Solar Ambassador team commissioned Sun Pacific Solar Electric, a local solar contracting company, to build 100 solar panels capable of generating 24 kilowatts of energy each. The panels officially began supplying power on May 17 and have been able to generate approximately a third of the grocery store’s energy usage since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a 20-year lease term, the Isla Vista Food Co-op plans to pay off the cost of its solar panels gradually over time. Representatives from RE-volv said this current plan cuts the Co-op’s electricity bill by 15-percent.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78309\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78309\" data-attachment-id=\"78309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-05/i-v-food-co-op-takes-powerful-step-with-solar-panel-installation/dsc_0260/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0260\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78309\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Isla Vista Food Co-op installed solar panels, which now account for a third of the store’s electricity needs. <em>Yuki Copnall / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaylan Lamb, a fourth-year environmental studies major and the project leader, said the project was possible because of the cooperation among the different organizations and businesses.</span></p>\n<p>Lamb thanked the RE-volv representatives, Co-op staff and community members who supported the campaign “even when things got rocky.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[RE-volv representatives] were really our sponsors and guardians throughout the whole project and really gave us the motivation in the first place to spearhead the crowdfunding campaign to get the solar panels,” Lamb said. “The Co-op staff were so patient and so cooperative with us … It was really a group effort, and awesome to be able to bring everyone together and celebrate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the ribbon-cutting, a Co-op employee played a tune on the trumpet that was received with cheers from the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Brinker, the associate director of partnership and philanthropy at RE-volv, said the ceremony was personal for her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This ceremony has a special place in my heart because I’m from Santa Barbara.

will cost approximately $5,000, according to Kim Equinoa, assistant dean for the Women’s Center.</p>\n<p>Contraceptives like the morning-after pill and general medical supplies like Band-Aids and pain relievers will be available at the vending machine.</p>\n<p>The products will be available to Isla Vistans and UCSB students, and the machine will display information about sexual health resources available on and off campus.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center plans to finalize the full list of vending machine products by the end of Fall Quarter, according to Diane Bell, pharmacist manager at Student Health. Bell said Student Health services will restock the vending machine when required.</p>\n<p>Students proposed the vending machine because they wanted access to health services beyond the hours of normal convenience and drug stores, Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>“We started researching different ways for producing this kind of service, and our students really carried it forward,” she said.</p>\n<p>Students will be able to use cash when purchasing the products.</p>\n<p>All of the items in the machine will be over-the-counter items that are also available at Student Health. The products will cost approximately the same as those offered at the Student Health pharmacy, Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to keep it a little limited to begin with and then expand over time as students let us know the kinds of things that they need,” Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>A.S. approved funding for the vending machine in spring of 2015 and allowed the allocated funds to carry through to the 2017-2018 school year.</p>\n<p>The Pardall Center also offers other A.S. services to I.V. community members, such as the A.S. Legal Resource Center and the A.S. I.V. Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center requires that the vending machine maintains specific temperature settings so the machine does not overheat and ruin the medication. Most medications are stored in locations at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center first proposed the project in 2015, but the idea has since grown into a collaboration between UCSB Student Health services, Associated Students (A.S.) and the center.</p>\n<p>Students will have access to the vending machine during the Pardall Center’s normal hours of operation: 8 a.m. to midnight on Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday, 10 a.m. to 7p.m. on Saturday and noon to midnight on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center, located on the first floor of the UCSB Student Resource Building, is a department that specializes in providing resources for female students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Since its founding 40 years ago, the center has added resources for students who identify within the LGBTQ spectrum and non-traditional students, such as women who want to return to school after having children.</p>\n<p>This center also works closely with the UCSB Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) program, which deals with interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Equinoa said she is looking forward to the vending machine’s opening in the winter and the opportunity to expand resources for students.</p>\n<p>“We’re just really excited to be able to continue providing services for students in this way and really hope to create greater access to resources for students through this project,” Equinoa said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
