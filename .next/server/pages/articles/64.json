This final match gave the Trojans the victory in doubles play and earned them the doubles point.</p>\n<p>The meet continued with singles play as Dubavets played against No. 56 Katz and defeated her, recording a score of 6-4, 6-4. Up next was Gaucho Gilbertson, who fell to the Trojans’ Smith, who beat Gilbertson 7-6 (5), 6-0. Freshman Trojan Kulikov defeated Baker, who was previously victorious in doubles play, at a score of 6-0, 7-6(4).</p>\n<p>At the halfway point in singles play the Trojans had a 2-1 lead against the Gauchos, leaving UCSB trying to get the lead back.</p>\n<p>Silveira beat USC’s Valdes 7-6(1), 7-6(4), leaving the point total all knotted up at 2-2 with only two games left in the meet.</p>\n<p>However, it was only Dubavets and Da Silveira who would come away with victories in singles play for the Gauchos, as USC made record wins in the remaining final two matches.</p>\n<p>Yamada lost in her match against the Women of Troy’s Sydney Van Alphen, posting a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 record in her sets. Westby defeated UCSB junior Amanda Atanasson 6-7, 6-4, 7-5.</p>\n<p>The Trojans came away with the victory in both singles and doubles play, winning with an overall score of 5-2, a worse result for UCSB compared to their matchup against USC last year that resulted in a 4-3 loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had some promising results in a match against a powerful USC team. The win in doubles play from Dubavets and Stojic as well as the singles victory from Dubavets and Da Silveira were good records despite the disappointing overall result.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to rebound from this loss next week as they travel down south to Texas to play Texas Tech in their second game on Jan. 28 at 3 p.m. PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-loses-versus-no-18-usc-to-start-season/","id":64,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[63,62,61],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2006-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Can't Buy Me Love... or Freedom","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Can’t Buy Me Love… or Freedom<br>\nSunday, Oct. 8, 1:20 a.m. – Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers were dispatched to the 6500 block of El Colegio Road after receiving reports that an intoxicated woman was knocking on random doors at an apartment building.</p>\n<p>When they arrived at the scene, an officer spoke to the director of the apartment building who said the 19-year-old subject had been disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>The woman had been running door-to-door through the apartment, talking loudly on her cell phone and asking residents for a place to pee or sleep.</p>\n<p>A deputy contacted the subject and asked her where she lived. The woman replied that she lived in the Santa Rosa Residence Hall, then corrected herself, saying she lived at the Pi Beta Phi sorority house.</p>\n<p>The officer noticed that the woman reeked of alcohol and could not maintain her balance, so he arrested her for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>As the deputy placed the woman under arrest, she whispered, “If you un-arrest me, I will give you $10,000.”</p>\n<p>Because bribery is frowned upon by the police force, the woman’s offer was rejected, and she was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Age-Blinded By Love<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:15 a.m. – Deputies walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were alerted to a group of five people standing in a parking lot drinking beer.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as a man, who was holding a can of Steel Reserve 211, hand the drink to a woman, who knocked the beer back.</p>\n<p>A deputy approached the woman, removed her from the crowd, and began questioning her. The woman said she was 17, but later admitted that she was only 16. The officer issued her a minor in possession citation, and let her go.</p>\n<p>The officer then turned his attention to the man and asked him how old he was. The man said he was 23 years old.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man why he gave the woman alcohol, to which the man replied, “Because this is I.V.”</p>\n<p>After the subject admitted that the woman did not look 21 years old, the officer asked him why he would provide her with alcohol outside, in front of patrolling deputies.</p>\n<p>The man eloquently replied, “She asked me for a drink, and I was like, OK.”</p>\n<p>When the officer informed the man that the woman was 16, he stupidly responded, “That’s bad.”</p>\n<p>It got worse when the police officer cited the man for furnishing alcohol to a minor, which incurs a minimum fine of $250.</p>\n<p>Who Got Pinocchio Drunk?<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:34 a.m. – While patrolling at the corner of Camino del Sur and Trigo Road, Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers observed a woman walking northbound down the street.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old woman was staggering all over the road, unable to keep her balance, when she saw the group of deputies. She then turned around and stumbled back the way she came.</p>\n<p>An officer stopped the woman and asked her if she was all right because she showed signs of intoxication, including the strong smell of a fruity alcohol.</p>\n<p>The subject told the officer that she was “OK” and said she was just walking with her boyfriend. The deputy, who knew the woman was lying, said he had just witnessed the woman walking alone, and reminded her that lying to a peace officer is against the law.</p>\n<p>The officer began collecting the woman’s information, and asked for her age. She told him she was 19 years old, but said her birthday was September 12, 1986, making her 20.</p>\n<p>The deputy dutifully corrected the woman on her age as he arrested her for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>A Squared Plus B Squared Equals More Than Drunk<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 7, 12:21 a.m. – Officers were called to a university-affiliated housing complex on the 6500 block of El Colegio Road, where one of the building’s resident assistants was detaining a 20-year-old man for harassment.</p>\n<p>The subject was allegedly yelling derogatory comments at a woman when the RA called 911.</p>\n<p>A deputy attempted to question the subject, but the man was so incoherent he could only manage to call the officer “Dude,” repeatedly.</p>\n<p>The man did not know where he was and denied the reports of harassment, but admitted to having “more than five beers but less than 10.” He also confessed to smoking marijuana for the first time.</p>\n<p>Honest Abe said no more, and the deputy arrested him for public intoxication.

Santa Barbara will enter the game with a .346 batting average along with a .420 on base percentage. UCSB seems to have the advantage offensively, and it looks to be the same in its following game the next day against Iowa State.</p>\n<p>Iowa State comes into the tournament with an 11-8 overall record, just one win away from UCSB’s win total. However, the two teams differ when it comes to their offensive performance.</p>\n<p>The Cyclones only average.304 at the plate, while their junior outfielder Cathlin Bingham leads the team with a .400 average. In contrast, Gaucho junior outfielder Kristen Clark leads UCSB with a remarkable .486 average.</p>\n<p>Despite the difference in batting, the pitching staffs for both teams are similar, as each boast strong freshman throwers.</p>\n<p>Gaucho freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin will attempt to follow up her first career no hitter last weekend against Charleston Southern. Compared to her time on the mound in high school, Gulvin notices a few changes in the way she currently pitches at the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>“I have to think a lot more about my pitches now,” Gulvin said.</p>\n<p>Although Gulvin carries a 4.13 ERA this year, she continues to prove herself reliable, as she has already collected 37 strikeouts in 42 innings pitched this season.</p>\n<p>Iowa State, however, has two strong freshman pitchers of its own who will test the Gaucho lineup.</p>\n<p>Cyclone freshman pitcher Emma Hylen enters the tournament with an outstanding 1.59 ERA in addition to 30 strikeouts. Cyclone freshman pitcher Savannah Sanders, with 46 strikeouts on the year, could also see the mound this weekend.</p>\n<p>If things go well, the Gauchos should have two wins right off the bat. However, their recent streak could be halted when they face Mississippi State.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs are one of the toughest teams in the tournament, and enter with an incredible 16-3 record. This is largely due to its exceptional pitching staff. Mississippi will be a big test for the strong Gaucho lineup, as its two best pitchers each come into the tournament with ERA’s below 1.00.</p>\n<p>Bulldog pitcher Regan Green currently owns a 0.81 ERA with 53 strikeouts. As if her statistics aren’t impressive enough, she is only a freshman. She is sure to be a threat to any team the Bulldogs go up against, and the Gaucho hitters will have to put all of their focus on getting to her.</p>\n<p>The pressure should lighten a little bit for UCSB as it closes out the tournament with a game against Princeton, who only holds a 3-6 record. The Tigers’ early slump has resulted in meager numbers such as their .249 batting average along with having scored only 32 runs this season.</p>\n<p>Still, Princeton has only played nine games this season, the least amount than any team at the tournament, so the Tigers are still working on putting their pitching and offense together.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s first game in the Louisville Slugger Invitational is scheduled for today against Utah Valley at 4:30 p.m. On Friday, the Gauchos face Iowa State at 9:00 a.m. and Mississippi State at 11:30 a.m. Saturday they will close out the tournament with a game at 10:00 a.m. against Princeton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/gauchos-looking-to-prolong-momentum-in-louisville-slugger-invitational/","id":62,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[61,60,59],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Continues to Excel, Own 3-Game Streak after Stacy Winsberg Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It is now back-to-back weekends in which the UCSB softball team finished with a 4-1 record in tournament play.

Brucelas went 3 for 3 on the day with two home runs, two runs scored, and four RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Coming off its win against Charleston Friday morning, UCSB faced a very tough matchup against UCLA in its afternoon game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a quick start in the first inning when junior outfielder Kristen Clark singled to third base, eventually scoring on a ringing double to leftfield by senior Arianna Palomores.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston followed with an RBI single into right field. Up 2-0 in the first with nobody out, the Gauchos failed to score more in the inning, and didn’t score again for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Gauchos lost their lead in the third when UCLA scored three runs on three hits highlighted by infielder Kylee Perez’s double which helped to bring in two runs to give UCLA a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The three hits in the third inning were the only hits in the game for UCLA, but it was enough to edge out the Gauchos for the win. Ashley Ludlow took the loss for the Gauchos, pitching six innings, giving up the three runs while striking out five and walking seven.</p>\n<p>In the game against CSU Bakersfield, the Gauchos had another impressive performance in their 7-4 win over the Roadrunners. The game started out slow for the Gauchos as they were down by one until the fourth inning.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB manage to turn things around offensively as it came back to score a total of six runs. Brucelas was on fire as she sparked the six-run rally with a home run to left field. Freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer finished up with a single to left field, scoring Palomores and Clark for the last two runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>Moreover, UCSB’s pitching staff did a solid job holding down Bakersfield’s lineup. Gulvin pitched through the fifth inning, giving up three runs and striking out three. Santa Barbara’s go-to senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow provided some necessary relief as she pitched the last two innings, giving up one run and striking out four.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to Long Beach next weekend to participate in the Louisville Slugger Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68896\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68896\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/ucsb-continues-to-excel-own-3-game-streak-after-stacy-winsberg-invitational/","id":63,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[62,61,60],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
