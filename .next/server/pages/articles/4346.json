There will be a tasting of pu’erh, wuyi oolong and Keemun Hao ya tea paired with fruit and nuts.

Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking can email organizers at <em>foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com</em>. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>Chill with Mindfulness and Meditation</strong></p>\n<p>For those interested in mindfulness and meditation, St. Michael’s Church will be hosting a Mindfulness and Compassion Meditation this Monday at 7 p.m. This event is regularly held on Mondays and includes a short dharma talk and guided meditation.

The class will be taught by Santa Barbara Krav Maga, and participants can cool down afterwards with free Blenders smoothies.</p>\n<p><strong>Shopping on a Budget </strong></p>\n<p>As students, we’re all a little tight on cash, so head over to the I.V. Food Co-op on Tuesday at 5 p.m. to learn more about shopping on a budget. You can learn various tips and tricks, including building a pantry and shopping based off of promotions and access-based pricing programs. There will be demos based on recipes from the cookbook “Good &amp; Cheap: Eat Well on $4/Day,” which will be raffled off at the event.</p>\n<p><em>An edition of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the

of coastline and thoroughly cook recreationally caught seafood. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The various coliforms and bacteria measured have remained at staggering levels above state standards. As of Monday, Goleta Beach has fecal coliform levels that are 150 percent over state standards and enterococcus levels at over 10,000 percent. Fecal coliform and enterococcus are types of bacteria.</p>\n<p>While eight beaches were closed initially, only Carpinteria State Beach, Goleta Beach and Hammond’s Beach remain closed.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department warns against going into affected waters, citing high levels of bacteria which could indicate that other disease-causing bacteria are present.</p>\n<p>The department will continue to conduct testing on Goleta Beach and other areas, but for now it recommends remaining 400 feet away from beach areas where mud transports are temporarily deposited. The buffer zone is marked by orange fencing.</p>\n<p>Elevated levels of bacteria in ocean water were first seen after Santa Barbara County began moving mud from Highway 101 to local beaches.</p>\n<p>Mud and soil runoff from the storms following the Thomas Fire in early December were collected and then transported by county flood control officials to make room for road repairs. Goleta Beach was selected as a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/mud-from-landslides-moved-to-goleta-beach-tested-for-safety/\">temporary storage site</a> for this policy.</p>\n<p>The mud dumping largely contributed to the rise in contaminant levels along surrounding areas due to the “unknown amounts of untreated sewage and possible chemical contaminants in the water and sand,” said Susan Klein-Rothschild, deputy director of Santa Barbara’s Public Health Department.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Public Health Department issued a release warning the public to “refrain from eating recreationally raw fish and shellfish where levels of bacteria highly exceed standards.” Individuals should cook “recreationally caught” seafood before consuming it, the department said in the release.</p>\n<p>Goleta Beach is one of the areas cited in the release.</p>\n<p>Campus Point remains open due to acceptable water conditions, county officials said, as coliform levels are stable and only enterococcus bacteria exists in the water. These conditions, however, could fluctuate for as long as mud is being brought to Goleta Beach.</p>\n<p>“Bacteria concentrations at Campus Point will likely be a function of currents and winds that bring the sediment plume from Goleta Beach to Campus Point,” explained Jenna Driscoll, an associate for Santa Barbara Channelkeeper.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Channelkeeper is conducting water soil tests for <em>E.Coli</em>, fecal coliform and other biological contaminants that could seriously affect beachgoers at these locations.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department is also testing the water. Updated data can be found on the Public Health Department and SBCK websites.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 1 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Jenna Driscoll’s name was mistakingly written as “Jenny,” due to an editing error. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80738\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80738\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/","id":4344,"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween"},"related":[4343,4342,4341],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Weekly Goings-On in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Tuesday, Feb. 13, The Women’s Center is hosting a guided art class and an evening of self-care from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. in the UCSB SRB Multipurpose Room.
