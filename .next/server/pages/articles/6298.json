Very close quarters.<br>\nTake it from your seasoned humper here — great fun looms in the fornicating future of your dorm room days, but I’m sure more than one of you will have a few hurdles to leap over along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m stuck in a triple. Halp.</strong><br>\nI know it seems like a disadvantage. The more roommates, the more people you have to surreptitiously kick out for your sexy time satisfaction. I’m here to assure you, however, that just because you’re cemented to the tripling scene doesn’t mean you’ll be sex-deprived.<br>\nUsually, a triple plays out in a few common scenarios. The first is that your roommates are laid back, tolerant or never home. Hence, your partner will journey his or her way down a few rooms (or an entire residence hall, if you’re into inter-hall intercourse) to your magical lair, and the deed will be done, easy-peasy. The second is the reverse situation where your partner has the tolerant roommates or, better yet, lives in a double or single. Don’t complicate your newly blossoming roommate relationship when the buddy you’re bangin’ has a perfectly wonderful rooming situation to make use of. As for the third scenario? Well, let’s just say that the more the merrier, and if y’all are down, might as well get down.<br>\nThere is, of course, the possibility of doing the nasty while your ‘mates (the living kind) are still in the room, whether snoozing along their REM cycle or distracted by a movie on their laptop. I advise you to tread carefully here because this one’s a bit sticky. Some might enjoy the idea of exhibitionism — even if the voyeur never meant to be one at all — and will find the notion of sex with others in the room an exciting, dark and dangerous thrill. However, many others will deem this act disrespectful and highly awkward. After being on both sides of the spectrum, I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry. Communicate with your roommates and don’t fuck with the rule of respect. Everyone shares a space, so honor that.</p>\n<p><strong>The dreadful sin called sexiling.</strong><br>\nBelieve me, it can be dreadful. Since we’re already on the topic of honoring the space of others, let’s talk sexiling. For those unfamiliar with this godforsaken term, sexiling refers to the typically unceremonious “exiling” of your roommate(s) from the room during your act of libidinous lovemaking. To give you an example, when my boyfriend was sexiled during his freshman year, he was forced to take his bedsheets outside and sleep in the hallway. Was he allowed to sleep there? No. Was he acting more spitefully than was proper? Maybe. But that’s what sexiling does to people. It makes them into bitter gremlins. Bitter, bitter gremlins.<br>\nTo avoid bitter gremlinhood, I suggest you have a clean, calm conversation with your roommates about your copulating needs. There’s no denying sex, and there’s no denying that as first-years (or any years) stuck in the cage called a shared dorm room, it will be very difficult to copulate freely. Don’t lose hope, however. Humans are flexible, adaptable beings. Talk it through, set up a system and buy them extra ramen. It’ll be all right, you’ll see.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Lofted bed is lofty.</strong><br>\nAfter the initial wave of novelty in a lofted bed dies down, the unfortunate reality of your bunked mattress is that sex up there isn’t the most convenient. Didn’t screw your bolts in right? You’ll be clanking and rocking your very own earthquake for the victims living below you. Put the bed up too high? Have fun bonking your brains out on the ceiling when you sit up to stretch. Need a paper towel to clean up? Or did you just realize that you need to pee right here, right now and right away? Sorry brah, take the ladder down your misery cot first.<br>\nTo be honest, besides delofting (literally and figuratively), there’s no real solution to your elevated bed, especially if you’re in a triple and can’t afford to lower it. The best thing to do in this case is to be prepared. Have some paper towels or tissues ready for a last-minute cleanup. Wedge your condoms between the mattress and bed frame instead of deep inside your drawer that you need to climb down for. Make sure your bed is secured and sturdily lofted before you buck-and-bang. I feel you on your troubles, but you might find your circumstance educational, if anything. After all, like our good pal Albert Einstein once said, “The only source of knowledge is experience.”</p>\n<p><strong>Turn down the volume, will you?</strong><br>\nIt’s Sunday, post-brunch. After a filling meal from DLG or Portola, you sink into your desk chair with your anthropology book or some math assignments that you’ve long procrastinated on. It’s all smooth going at first. Easy reading, easy scribbling of your pencil on the paper … and then shit doesn’t just hit, but ruthlessly demolishes the fan. Those low, lusty moans turn into powerful grunts and groans, thundering yelps and yips and ear-splitting shouts and screams. Forget homework — let me cleanse my ears first.<br>\nThere’s nothing wrong with loud sex … when you’re not disrespecting others during the course of it. Of course, it’s difficult to maintain self-restraint, especially when you’re reaching the point of no return, but the inevitable reality is that halls and halls of your peers are stationed right above, next to or below you.<br>\nUsually the people who have constant, loud sex are proud of their noise, embarrassed by it or unaware of its actual volume. Screamers, just close those damn windows. I know it gets hot in there, so consider investing in a fan and taking a nice, relaxing shower afterward. As for the fed-up listeners, pluck up some courage and overcome your passive aggressiveness by tactfully — yes, tactfully — confronting the loud lovers. More often that not, however, the sad truth is that the noise will not go away. The libido is insatiable, so the best way you can work around the situation is move away from the ruckus. Change up your environment and work in the lounge, UCen or Davidson Library. These spaces were made to accommodate you, so be sure to take advantage of them.</p>\n<p>While the issues of dormitory sex life are abundant indeed, fear not. Humps always prevail.

No, it’s not just there to potentially give people life-threatening cancer; in fact, the prostate is a magical organ that can provide men with a type of bliss that’s hard to match.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, guys, you might be telling yourselves that it’s “gay” to put stuff up your butt in a sexual way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m here to say, “Nope! Not gay at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you attracted to other men? If you answered yes, then okay, yeah, you might be gay. However, if you answered with a resounding no, then you’re not gay, you’re just curious what a dildo might feel like stuffed up your anal canal. The act of fucking yourself in the ass isn’t what’s gay — rather, it’s the attraction to who is doing the fucking.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He freaked out for a second because he didn’t understand what was going on, but once he figured out it wasn’t a sign he was dying, he got waaayyyyy more enthusiastic.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time I suggested butt play to my current partner, he agreed because it seemed like something I really wanted to do, not because he thought it would feel good. That opinion changed pretty quickly after I slipped a finger into his ass while giving the most enthusiastic blowjob I’ve ever performed. After a bit more stimulation, he came from fellatio for the second time in his life, so it’s safe to say he was probably into it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was even better next time when I got further in and found his prostate. I knew I had struck sex gold when I started massaging the smooth, stiff, spherical lump that lives up there and my guy’s eyes rolled into the back of his head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He came to when he thought he felt like he was going to pee. Instead, he began leaking an insane amount of pre-cum. Like, it was a small stream flowing down his dick onto his stomach. He freaked out for a second because he didn’t understand what was going on, but once he figured out it wasn’t a sign he was dying, he got waaayyyyy more enthusiastic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this session, both of us realized a few things: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) My fingers were too short and his ass was too tight for me to really get up there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) We both wanted to take this much further.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This being said, we talked about it and decided to implement some toys into this new pastime of ours. The existence of toys was not new to us, but, thus far, they’d only been stuck into me. Because it was known by both of us that I was more well-versed in sexual safety and just sexual knowledge in general (thank you, r/sex), Boy trusted me with obtaining the first pocket rocket to enter his butt.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, he was the one asking me to fuck him — not me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that looking for an ass dildo was going to be different than looking for a pussy dildo for a few reasons. First off, assholes tend to be much tighter than vaginas, so preparation and build-up was going to take longer. This meant that I had to start small and go from there so I didn’t make his butthole a buttchasm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, the shape of the new object needed to be unique so that the prostate would be adequately stimulated. After all, that’s the whole reason we’re doing this. So I started looking at dildos that had a slight curve to them, as suggested by my online research. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I looked for something with a smooth texture for easy insertion. I settled on a glass dildo from Amazon for $10 that’s about seven inches long and 1.5 inches in circumference. It has anal beads on one side and a pointed tip on the other for maximum pleasure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I wasn’t planning on letting go while doing the deed, I wasn’t too concerned with finding an ass dildo with a base flare — something commonly suggested to keep shit from getting stuck up there without a way out. My subsequent purchases are definitely going to have a base, though, because I underestimated the slipperiness of lube on glass. Nothing got lost, but it was definitely hard to maintain a stable grip while thrusting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let me tell you, that thing is magical. It had Boy begging me to fuck harder, and afterward he said he almost came from just that nearly three times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He reported that his dick was “sore from being so hard,” but he also said that wasn’t a bad thing. Apparently, the orgasm from a mixture of him fucking me and the dildo in his ass was much more intense than a normal one. He described it as an orgasm he would have after not cumming for a week or so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, he was the one asking me to fuck him — not me. The next thing on our list is a legitimate strap-on that I’ll use to peg him, which honestly shocked me a bit because I wasn’t even the one to suggest it. I thought we’d go about this process in small increments, maybe a butt plug here and there, but I definitely did not ever picture myself full-on pegging him. Once he proposed it, though, I couldn’t think about anything else. I don’t think I’ll be able to until it actually comes to fruition (which will hopefully be soon).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll leave y’all with a compressed list of Dos and Don’ts in case reading this sparked some curiosity in you and you want to try your hand at sticking things in orifices:</span></p>\n<p><b>DO go slow.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like any muscle, the anus has to get warmed up before it gets positively rammed, and this can take a few days. That’s right: days. The act of relaxing enough to allow something up your butt takes a while to master, so try incorporating some mild ass play into the sexy times leading up to the big shebang. Also, the feeling of needing to poop might need some getting used to as well (that never really goes away).</span></p>\n<p><b>DO use lots of lube.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Again, assholes are tight. You’re gonna need something to help ease the dildo in there, and lube kinda exists to do that. Make sure you use the right lube, though. Silicone-based lube should never be used with silicone toys because it compromises the integrity of the toy’s structure. Also, oil-based lubes shouldn’t be used with safer sex barriers (i.e. condoms) because those will also deteriorate and can have serious consequences. Water-based lube tends to be the least problematic, but do look into the pros and cons of each type of lube before you get some.</span></p>\n<p><b>DON’T kinkshame!!!!</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you partner asks you if you guys could try this out, don’t freak out and make them feel bad about themselves. I’m not saying you should do it if you don’t want to, but be understanding and calmly explain that you’re not interested. You don’t have to be a dickwad about it.</span></p>\n<p><em>Roxie Night wants you to be safe and open-minded when experimenting with new things.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81137\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81137\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/","id":6295,"author":{"id":644,"name":"Roxie Night"},"related":[6294,6293,6292],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No Hump, No Problem: Why I Stopped Having Sex at the Peak of My Sexuality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nohump.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nohump.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Leilani Riahi takes a fresh approach to sex and rediscovers a love for people.

We could still hear the ballistic frat boy rants and skinny dip squeals vibrating the small college town of Isla Vista, California, making me feel that much more pleased that I was with him instead of them this young night. I looked at his face without touching, and I was bewildered. Bewildered that we hadn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t kissed yet, as this was exactly the kind of patient romance I had been yearning for, even though he was going back to the Bay tomorrow. I sighed. I swooned. We talked about life and art, and god knows I get consensually weak with that. We heard the ocean crash the way our energies were uniting and so he proposed that we go to the beach and just be. Classic. But WAIT. I heard a piercing siren go off in my dreamy mind. WAIT. BEEP BEEP. Was the sex about to happen? Cum on. You know what I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m talking about, baby.

This time, the beach and a boy didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t feel like a situation of objectification. There wasn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t that tense air of expectation I had so easily pleased in the past just to make things more comfortable. NO. There was no having sex just because I felt responsible for giving it or kissing because it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s what people do in the dark. I enjoyed other things. I was mystified over holding hands because it felt organic, just like the dialogue dripping from our tongues in spaces that would otherwise be spent interlocking our predestined-to-be-nude bodies on a mossy rock way more uncomfortable than either of us would have admitted later on. I knew our lips were about to spark with that last stormy wave caressing the sand, and so they did with giggles plucking harp strings of the wind mixed with an original song in my head shrieking </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is different. Maybe this is real</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different. It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s a word overused with love stories, and no longer can I feel why this situation was different in comparison to others that might have been overlooked or silenced. Why? Because I am numb to all of my sexual fantasies at this point, where the fantasy part to my longings was having sex with someone I liked who also liked me back. The fantasy was having an experience where sex was a manifestation of developed respect between him and myself and an attraction expressing itself in another way, not needing sex as the only way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted lust and freedom intertwined with intimacy and learning. Being together just because we are human and that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s what humans enjoy. I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t stop having sex that night, even though this guy and I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t have sex. I liked him too much for that. I stopped having sex when I realized that I stopped having sex with people I liked because I liked them, and they may have liked me too, which meant that I was having sex with people that I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t truly enjoy and who didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t know me or care to either. DONE. Muthafuckin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GAME OVER for me to have casual sex when the casualness of it made me forget what pleasure sex brought to my lovely vagina in the first place. I think I got confused. I love sex. I love having sex. I started casual sex because it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s fun and it feels good. But I kept up casual sex because I wanted it to turn into a deep connection with someone, and casual sex is one of the only opportunities I saw to get to know a being (through as the side effect of spillover time, like whispering things before bed or sharing your class schedule with them the next day).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I don</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t remember this situation being that different, because at the end of it, he still asked for sex, and even though I said no, I couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t help but think that all of the fluff was fluff to lead up to fucking, like foreplay to the foreplay. He left the next day and has barely contacted me since, and it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s quite all right. But I also couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t help but think of how many times things felt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">different</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like that, and I did, in fact, like that person, and they may or may not have liked me, but either having sex even though I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t want to yet or not having sex because I LIKED THEM AND DID WANT IT kept me from experiencing this true difference to its most bloomed form. I also thought about all those moments lost in the limbo toxic hole of being NUMB after hurting through sex, like when I was not acknowledged by them again afterward or when I forced myself not to have sex even though it was probably a beautiful time to do it with someone or when I just laid there and forgot that sex was happening to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt used, nothing, everything, scared, deprived, restless, horny, asexual, invaded and bored that I stopped having sex actively for six months last year. It was at the peak of my wild feelings and out-of-control substance use and emotions that couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t be contained. But I let it go because I knew what it felt like and it didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t feel like what I needed and wanted to be healthy. I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t know exactly what I wanted from sexuality, but I knew what I did not want from it and life. So, I cut those ties and I did not have sex even when I liked others, because, this time, it wasn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t because I liked them that I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t want to get hurt or move </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too quickly,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it was because I actually had nothing to give and nothing I wanted to take. I was floating on in life and finding happiness in crevices that surprised me. I was reigniting my senses to feel and be awake to life all around where I once was taken from and not replenished. I was replenishing myself and understanding what I need from sex and what I can give. I also understood my selfish reasons for having sex before and the ways in which I put myself in situations continuously that were not in synch with my soul</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s true nature. I became me and I understood and respected what makes me most vibrant. I tried then to get to know other people, and for the first time, to get to know everyone as just a friend without the prospects of sex or love. I let go of using them to project my own fantasies onto and I tried to be less self-centered. They are all people. Beautiful, wondrous people, and I wanted to know who they were outside of sex or a buildup to it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were quite astonishing. They were wonderful. I fell in love with people again, and I fell in love with myself. I traveled and laughed. I ate and let go. I got full again, and I was ready to give when time allowed it. Since then I have had sex with one person and it was all very natural. I am living open to sexuality, but open to a redefined, reclaimed version of sexuality that includes so much nurturance, reciprocity, consent, respect, amusement, safety, excitement, fun and love that it will not be everywhere at any time. It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s a sexuality that is me and it is back and better than ever, even if it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s not always active in sex. It is always active inside of me. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-20/no-hump-no-problem-why-i-stopped-having-sex-at-the-peak-of-my-sexuality/","id":6296,"author":{"id":408,"name":"Leilani Leila Riahi"},"related":[6295,6294,6293],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Inside the Mind of Jordan Mitchell","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2019-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0655.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0655.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"If you haven’t heard him on Spotify, watched his music videos on YouTube or seen him spinning decks  in Isla Vista — you should.

Mitchell added that his inspiration stemmed from a renewed appreciation of the children’s yogurt, a name now shared among his newest album and his favorite snack. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Mitchell revealed that there’s more to it than just the name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned that in his Danimals prime, Mitchell did not like to share his yogurt as a kid, instead opting to keep it for himself. After departing from his prior band, N/A, Mitchell applied this same mentality to his newest pursuit — this time on a much bigger level. Almost all the vocal and musical elements for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Touch My Danimals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were crafted by Mitchell himself, an element of production he learned to embrace after deciding to embark on his project alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was putting in more effort than everybody else [in the band] and I said ‘fuck that.’ I can just do things by myself. When people were pushing me to be my own artist, it kind of revamped me to where I was … So I learned from this group who I am and I’m going to go [do this] by myself,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we talked through the project’s five-month timeline, Mitchell elaborated on his unorthodox and experimental nature when producing the album. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I quickly became familiar with the fact that Mitchell is picky, a desirable trait in music. In “Sancho,” for example, Mitchell produced the track three separate times: once as a trap beat, once as a Mariachi beat and once as a “trap-Mariachi” beat. To produce the song “Tokyocitypop,” Mitchell had to sift through two years’ worth of his own archives to find what he was looking for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was going through old beats. I was making new beats. I was experimenting with beats. I was experimenting extremely with sound … I want [this album] to represent exactly how I’m processing this. I treat this album like a film. I’m the director, but I’m also the writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his favorite memory with the album, Mitchell knew right away: the time he produced the third portion of “Tokyocitypop,” a track inspired by his feelings of hopeless romanticism. It didn’t come easily, though. After fabricating “four versions” of the track based off “15 different samples,” his thirst for the proper soundtrack was finally quenched.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music aside, Mitchell also worked to produce content that wasn’t limited to speakers. After $500, a trip to Studio City, a rented mansion and a camera crew, the music video for “Sancho” was born. “Bird” followed suit as well, in which Mitchell revealed there was “a whole lot of planning” and “a lot of different scenes.” </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88184\" style=\"width: 1377px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2115137870\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88181\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88184\" data-attachment-id=\"88184\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/inside-the-mind-of-jordan-mitchell/bol_0021/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=1367%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1367,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BOL_0021\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88184\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=888%2C1330\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1330\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88184\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jordan Mitchell</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But everything aforementioned is about the finished products — what about everything that led to them? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, the Stockton-bred artist recommends “just fucking do it.” Mitchell advised if you’re interested in dipping a toe into the music world — jump in. Immersion is the fastest way to learn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nine times out of 10 you’re gonna suck when you start. It’s okay to be bad as shit. You develop,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replication, according to Mitchell, is a tool for progressing in music that comes not too far after taking the initial plunge. Before “you can be yourself” in music, Mitchell explained that it’s easiest to mimic similar styles of other musicians first, then taper down and try to produce music unique to yourself. Once that’s all down, Mitchell explained, then you can commit to making your own music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s much easier said than done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning when he was 11 years old, the now 21-year-old Mitchell has spent the last 10 years blowing air into trumpets and strumming guitars and, most recently, bass. This time period paralleled his zeal for a variety of music genres such as rock and metal. As for hip-hop, he was interested in that, too, but surprisingly “not that much.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with his affinity for Weezer and System of a Down, Mitchell also has an ear for mariachi-style music, elements of which can be heard throughout </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Touch My Danimals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When chronicling his timeline of favorite genres, Mitchell somewhat alluded to a third facet of learning music: Take pride in what you make. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a musician, Mitchell placed a heavy emphasis on preserving his artistic vision. After returning to his hometown of Stockon, for example, Mitchell caught the ears of other people in the recording studio who heard him play the beat for his song “Neotokyo.” He was immediately flooded with requests to be featured on his song — all of which he declined. But why?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very psyched about features and I don’t want to feature you on this song,” Mitchell told those who asked. Mitchell explained to me that when he has an idea, he sticks to it. He also told me it’s not nice to invite yourself onto somebody else’s soundtrack — it’s rude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When producing music, Mitchell pays careful attention to his craft, treating “voices as instruments” on top of the already-present soundtrack. Mitchell’s explanation of his production game showed me just how much effort it takes to create quality soundtracks, a facet of the music industry he finds with not enough light shed on it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re getting into this time when we’re finally starting to recognize producers. You had Zaytoven, Lex Luger, TOKiMonsta, Flying Lotus — all these producers who just weren’t recognized” — and now, finally, they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For trap music specifically, Mitchell believes the beat is “meant to shine,” while other styles, such as boom-bap, are meant to complement the lyrics. Regardless, if it wasn’t for a quality soundtrack to support the lyrics of many popular songs, Mitchell has a hunch that “rappers wouldn’t be shit without a beat.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To produce a beat, however, inspiration always helps. Mitchell finds his inspiration by treating each composition as a “very open diary.” In doing so, Mitchell’s music doubles as both a soundtrack and narration of some part of his life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never rocked by shit I’ve never done. That’s a very big rule. Even in my most hood-rat songs, I used to do all that. That’s the whole point,” he said. “I have Tinder love. I swiped right, she swiped left — that shit hurt! These are funny things, and, you know, how do I talk about this?” he said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88186\" style=\"width: 694px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1147752975\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88181\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88186\" data-attachment-id=\"88186\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/inside-the-mind-of-jordan-mitchell/bol_0728/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=1367%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1367,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BOL_0728\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-88186\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728-684x1024.jpg?resize=684%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jordan Mitchell</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two full albums and nearly ten singles on Spotify alone, it’s clear that Mitchell has many stories to tell — a few of which have garnered noticeable amounts of attention on the popular music-streaming app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With recognition comes fame, but Mitchell doesn’t want it. When asked if he has any desire to be famous in the future, Mitchell said, “It’s cool … but I don’t give a fuck about being famous.” If it happens, it happens. But he says he likes his privacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell also hopes to one day make outrageously expensive music production software more accessible to help students have an easier time mastering it and alleviate the pain of shelling wads of cash to acquire even the most essential tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His reason? Education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Mitchell really cares about is teaching. When he’s not behind a DJ set or an instrument, he’s behind a desk, teaching students how to transform their ideas into tangible compositions. After </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/new-hip-hop-classes-bounce-into-campus-next-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teaching a music production class</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through the College of Creative Studies last winter quarter, Mitchell will be attending the University of Southern California next fall to earn a master’s degree in music education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kids that I taught music composition and hip-hop to — I want them to become famous. I want to sit down and be like, ‘They did that. And I’m proud of them,’ ” he said. “I’m not gonna sit here and ask for money. I just know that I did my job as an educator and happened to rap and produce my own stuff. At the end of the day, I just want to teach.”  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
