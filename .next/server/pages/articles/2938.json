The program draws on UCSB students to work as paid translators for parent-teacher conferences in schools where a language barrier exists between the student’s family and the teacher.</p>\n<p>Susan Derwin, director of the IHC, said the program was created as a way for graduate and undergraduate students to refine their language skills and practice them within a community setting.</p>\n<p>“Our aim was to draw upon tools associated with the humanities to deepen students’ engagement with local communities while also strengthening relationships between the university as an institution, local schools, and UCSB students, faculty, and staff,” Derwin said in an email.</p>\n<p>The program has two main goals: facilitating the involvement of parents with the education of their children and providing UCSB students as role models for children pursuing higher education later in life, Derwin said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Elementary and Franklin Elementary are the schools currently part of the parent-teacher interpreter program.</p>\n<p>Interpreters have also been provided for the Individualized Education Program in three different school districts: Santa Barbara Unified School District, Goleta Union School District and Hope School District.</p>\n<p>The Humanities and Fine Arts Instructional Improvement Grant, which supports the improvement of language instruction for UCSB students, and the Goleta Union School District fund the program.</p>\n<p>Derwin says the program initially faced problems getting the word out to possible interpreters for the program and bringing in people who were interested.</p>\n<p>Much of the support for the program came when Professors Aline Ferreira and Viola Miglo of the Spanish and Portuguese Departments became interested in the program and recruited the help of their language students.</p>\n<p>Ferreira holds the training sessions, according to Derwin.</p>\n<p>The program had 21 interpreters working for the Fall 2018 conferences and Derwin expects that number to rise to about 35 for the Spring 2019 Conferences.</p>\n<p>Student translators are taught key vocabulary needed to navigate the parent-teacher conferences, as well as how to handle issues of confidentiality and family-based issues.</p>\n<p>“They see that the skills they take for granted – their own bilingualism – is an important resource for the future, as they consider careers paths that might draw upon the outstanding language skills they possess,” Derwin said.</p>\n<p>Derwin says the program has largely been a success with schools. Feedback from the translators and teachers has shown a high level of satisfaction with the program.</p>\n<p>Casie Kilgore, principal of Franklin Elementary, said the translators were a highlight of fall semester and were constantly talked about.</p>\n<p>“My translator was great,” wrote one teacher at Franklin Elementary. “She told me after that she saw herself in the little girl during the conference and was so touched to help a family understand the importance of education at an early age. After she left, I realized, what a great example she is to the family and the student of a current college student pursuing her education.”</p>\n<p>The program is receiving more and more requests for interpreters and Derwin believes that it is an indicator of the program’s quality and success.</p>\n<p>“Many of our interpreters who are heritage speakers have shared with us that when they were in elementary school, they often had to serve as interpreters for their own parents, and this was very challenging.  Now they are in a position to help students who are in a similar position.”</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 9 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Arturo Martinez is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Jan. 10, 12:13 p.m.]: The IHC is the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center, not the Interpersonal Humanities </i><i>Center, as stated in a previous version of this article.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

href=\"https://twitter.com/islavistaparty/status/1079173142680002565\">Twitter</a>, the party announced that the two members – Associated Students (A.S.) Internal Vice President Steven Ho and External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect (EVPSA) Mayela Morales – were removed due to Title IX-related violations and “unprofessionalism that has come to light,” according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The two were removed from the party during summer 2018, the statement said. This is the first time the Isla Vista Party publicly announced the decision.</p>\n<p>According to Ho, he was first informed of his removal by the social media posts.</p>\n<p>“I was unaware of my removal until the statement released by leadership of the party,” he said.</p>\n<p>When Ho reached out to party leadership to discuss the matter, he was told “that someone was supposed to talk to me and poor communication within the party resulted in that not happening.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Party did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>Morales declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> from the EVPSA position after it was discovered she was not enrolled at UC Santa Barbara during Spring Quarter 2018. She currently serves as the Parliamentarian for the A.S. Senate and as the Chief of Staff for the Office of the Student Advocate.</p>\n<p>In the statement, the Isla Vista Party (IVP) apologized for not previously announcing the removal of the two members and “for contributing to community members feeling unsafe in student government spaces due to this.”</p>\n<p>This is the second instance of separation between parties and high-profile members to occur during winter break.

Students and faculty also talked about the presence of undocumented students on campus and the positive influence immigrants have had on Santa Barbara’s economy.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sociology professor William Robinson said Obama has been known as the deportation president to many undocumented individuals, with more deportations occurring under his administration than any other, according to Robinson.</p>\n<p>“On the one hand he’s talking about the rights of immigrants and he’s giving temporary residency to some immigrants that meet certain conditions,” Robinson said. “Yet on the other hand, he’s deported more immigrants than any other president in about fifty to sixty years.”</p>\n<p>Robinson said immigrants to the U.S. have become the “scapegoat” for the multitude of financial and economic problems the country is currently facing, all of which are reflected in Obama’s immigration policies.</p>\n<p>“First, it’s generating a great humanitarian crisis for 12 million immigrants in the country and their families, and second, immigrants play an absolutely crucial role in sustaining the U.S., and for that matter the global economy,” Robinson said. “Third, these mass deportations without the due process is violation of international law.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, in order to fix what he calls the mass deportation issue in the U.S., the government must enforce a suspension on all raids and deportations of undocumented citizens. He also said undocumented individuals should have full labor, civil and political rights including automatic residency to undocumented citizens that have no record of criminal activity in the form of an easier pathway to citizenship than current exists.</p>\n<p>“This notion that you can divide the global population to citizen and immigrant is an outdated notion and one that is creating a new access of inequality worldwide,” Robinson said, “Inequality between citizens who have all these rights and immigrants who don’t have any of those rights.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them. – MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robinson said it is vital that students understand issues surrounding mass deportation as urgent social and political issues that directly affect students and faculty at the university.</p>\n<p>“We have both documented and undocumented immigrants right here on campus, so they should be sensitive and aware of this issue and what’s at stake,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion Golash-Boza cited the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 as a starting point of racialized immigration policy in the U.S. and said that, fast-forwarding to the present day, even without a specific law stating that deportation is exclusive to a certain ethnic group, evidence shows that a majority of recent U.S. deportations have been of individuals of Latino descent.</p>\n<p>“Even though [the government] can’t directly create a law that says, ‘We aren’t going to target Latinos,’ it’s still able to happen,” Golash-Boza said. “The racial contours of immigration policy have changed, but it’s still constant.”</p>\n<p>MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau said part of the MCC’s mission is to bring attention to issues involving underrepresented populations in America.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing our part here in our community by bringing in speakers to address these hard issues,” Thibdeau said. “Mass deportation is a very sensitive topic that can be very political, but we aren’t afraid of those type of topics.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out. – Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thibdeau also said the MCC wanted to make sure students are informed of the impact governmental policies can have on the nation.</p>\n<p>“We certainly have students here that might not have as much of a voice, that this idea of mass deportation might actually directly impact them,” Thibdeau said. “There may be students here that aren’t citizens for example, or maybe their parents aren’t, so it’s a very important issue to make sure we’re all aware of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chicano/Chicana and Black studies major Abigail Salazar said Golash-Boza’s discussion did a great job of explaining the essential role global capitalism has on minorities, although she also excluded some specific details.</p>\n<p>“I think she really talked about what’s happening in immigration on a global setting and how capitalism plays a role in it, but I feel like a lot of the resistance that’s enacted by the undocumented community had been left out,” Salazar said. “For example, the Undocumented Youth Movement and different groups who have passed a lot of laws like the Trust Act and the new law AB60.”</p>\n<p>According to Salazar, students need to become more aware of the presence of undocumented students on campus as well as of the vital role the Santa Barbara immigrant community plays in supporting the local economy.</p>\n<p>“Whether [the students] are invested in the <em>News-Press</em> or other types of institutions, its foundation is immigrant community but at the same time its racism against the immigrant community,” Salazar said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Matthew Avalos said the discussion touched on his personal experiences as well as on the history of deportation he has learned from his classes at the university.</p>\n<p>“I am Hispanic myself and I have a lot of Hispanic friends, so I’ve heard stories of parents of friends who thought they could get deported,” Avalos said. “I just didn’t know that it had blown up to this extent and turned into such a massive problem.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It’s about unity, it’s about showing strength, it’s about believing that together,” Bogdanov said, “We can build a better community for all of us, for future generations of students.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said he urges people to join IVTU’s movement and reclaim I.V. from unethical landowners.</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe in fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities for all,” Bogdanov said. “I want you to see that together we can really make it and we can really build a powerful movements and we can really, as tenants, reclaim Isla Vista from the, quite frankly, scummy landlords that are taking over our town; that are taking over your town.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted IVTU president Andrey Bogdanov stating his belief in “fair and negligible housing.” Bogdanov actually said “fair and equitable”.
