Santa Barbara remains in fourth place in the Big West, improving to 9-7 in conference and 13-15 overall. The Highlanders drop to 4-12 in league and 11-16 overall.</p>\n<p>“We knew that they got us at our place, a game that we definitely should not have lost,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “It was senior night for them, so we knew they’d come out fired up and we had to be as fired up, if not more, and bring some energy.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the team’s final regular season road game of the year, UCSB came out ready to play. Using 13-3 and 9-0 runs, the Gauchos doubled up on Riverside 28-14 and eventually took a 32-17 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>“Coming off a bad game, we came out this afternoon with a chip on our shoulder, knowing that we had to come out fired up because the effort we came out with [against Fullerton] was unacceptable,” Nesbit said.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB shot an incredible 53.6 percent from the field in the first half, compared to 25 percent from Riverside.</p>\n<p>“We just pushed. We didn’t think about anything,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “We didn’t run plays; it was just transition. We were attacking and had a lot of points in the paint, so I think that’s what led to the win.”</p>\n<p>While in the past, the Gauchos have often started the second half complacent when they have held large leads and have watched their advantage disappear, UCSB continued to keep its foot on the gas, extending its lead to as many as 21 points with 14:13 remaining.</p>\n<p>“[At halftime], I just challenged them that it was zero to zero,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I wanted them to understand that when you get a team down and you’re on their court, [you have to] to put them away and the upperclassmen accepted that challenge. Even when UCR made a couple runs, you could see the look on their face like ‘we’re not going to let this happen again.’”</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB outshot Riverside 46.7 to 35.6 percent and outscored the Highlanders 30-14 in the paint.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara featured three players in double figures with junior guard Melissa Zornig and Mason each tallying 10, but it was Nesbit who had the hot hand for UCSB, scoring 20 points, which ties her career-high. Nesbit also finished with three assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“She has the ability to score points on any given night,” Mitchell said. “But for me, the importance was that she got after it on the defensive end of things and controlled the tempo with her calmness on the ball.”</p>\n<p>Mason also stood out for UCSB, starting for the Gauchos and recording a double-double. Along with her 10 points, she grabbed 12 rebounds, breaking her previous career-high of 10.</p>\n<p>“I just felt real free today,” Mason said. “It was fun and I’m glad I could do it in front of my family. My focus was going after everything.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos held the Highlanders to 35.6 percent shooting and forced 19 turnovers, compared to just 10 for UCSB. Santa Barbara also outrebounded Riverside 36-27.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 11 steals is the most ever during Mitchell’s reign.</p>\n<p>“I’m satisfied with the way our kids recovered after a disappointing loss,” Mitchell said. “They came out extremely focused and competitive, so overall, I’m satisfied with our play and of course, the outcome.”</p>\n<p>Next week, UCSB returns home for its final games of the regular season, hosting Long Beach State and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

For Clements, a San Diego native, the road trips have been one of the highlights of the experience. So far this year, he’s travelled with the team to Seattle and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been with the team every step of the way on road trips,” Clements said. “I’m there eating with them. It’s awesome and it’s unique. I don’t know of any other teams in the NCAA where they have their broadcaster travel with the team. It’s usually an independent thing.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, Clements didn’t go looking for the job. Instead, the job found him.</p>\n<p>“It’s a funny story,” Clements said. “I just heard through the grapevine that [Hurst] was leaving, so I said goodbye and it was his last day in the office. It had never even crossed my mind, but he was like, ‘you should totally apply for the women’s basketball job.’”</p>\n<p>Hurst helped Clements put together his demo reel and critiqued his KCSB broadcasts to improve his broadcast quality. After turning in the demo reels, Clements received an interview. “I think [Clements is] outstanding,” Mahoney said.</p>\n<p>“I pressed hard for him to get the position. He is an incredibly hard worker. He’s done us proud.”</p>\n<p>While Clements may be a student, he has gained plenty of experience.</p>\n<p>After deciding in high school that he wanted to go into sports journalism, Clements committed to being a Gaucho. In fact, the only reason he applied to UCSB was because of Jim Rome.</p>\n<p>“I knew [Rome] had a successful broadcasting career afterwards and I was like, ‘I’m not Jim, but if this place worked for him, it could do wonders for me as well,’” Clements said. “I knew he did stuff at KCSB, so naturally the first week I looked into how to the join the station.”</p>\n<p>Wanting to be comfortable behind the microphone before going into sports broadcasting, Clements started as a DJ for KJUC, KCSB’s AM station. The next quarter, Clements got his own show with KCSB and joined the sports staff.</p>\n<p>“My first game as color, I was too scared to do play- by-play, and I maybe had two minutes of talking, but I was so scared,” Clements said. “It was a women’s basketball game against Pacific. Even though it was probably unbearable to listen to, I had fun and I’ve never left since.”</p>\n<p>His junior year, Clements became the KCSB sports director, which meant organizing all the sports broadcasts that KCSB would broadcast.</p>\n<p>“It was a great experience learning how to organize and not only put on the broadcasts, but try and train the broadcasters to put on quality broadcasts,” Clements said.</p>\n<p>As for the future, Clements dream is to anchor the primetime edition of SportsCenter.</p>\n<p>“I think I’m on my way, but I know it’s tough. A lot of luck is involved [to break into the industry],” Clements said. “I think the best way to approach that is to work hard. That’s why I’ve been given this opportunity.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 23rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49586\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-student-takes-over-as-official-play-by-play-announcer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49586\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-student-takes-over-as-official-play-by-play-announcer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-student-takes-over-as-official-play-by-play-announcer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-student-takes-over-as-official-play-by-play-announcer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-student-takes-over-as-official-play-by-play-announcer/","id":641,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[640,639,638],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Like Father, Like Daughter","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_WBasketball_011013-121.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_WBasketball_011013-121.jpg?resize=550%2C647&ssl=1","description":"You could say that basketball is in Angelei Aguirre’s blood.

Whether that was basketball or something else, he was really supportive.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Angelei did turn to basketball and when she did, her dad was there.</p>\n<p>“He’d take me to work out all the time or we’d talk after games about what I could’ve done better — the typical coach because he was coaching most of the time while I was playing basketball,” Angelei said.</p>\n<p>Through it all, though, it wasn’t Dad that she inspired to be, instead wanting to be her own player. And that she certainly is. At first glance at their personas on the court, it’s impossible to tell that Angelei and Mark are related.</p>\n<p>“Our games are totally different,” Mark said. “She’s more like my friend Magic (Johnson) than she is like me. “</p>\n<p>Angelei is most known for her defense. At 5’11’’, the senior guard can provide a tall, long presence against a guard or can body up down low. She often has the responsibility of guarding the opponent’s best player.</p>\n<p>With 0.7 blocks per game, Angelei is tied for first on the team. She also ranks third on the squad, and is the No. 1 guard in rebounding, averaging 3.8 per game.</p>\n<p>“It’s just that blue-collar mentality,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “She has that god-given athletic ability, but also on most teams that she’s played on has been willing to take the back seat to do all the dirty things.”</p>\n<p>Mark, on the other hand, was first and foremost a scorer. Over his 13-year career, Mark averaged 20.0 points per game and during the 1983-84 campaign, he averaged 29.5 points per game, second in the NBA. As the Dallas Mavericks’ main weapon, Mark was a physical player, earning a lot of his baskets in the paint.</p>\n<p>“I don’t remember watching him play in person, but I’ve seen a lot of film,” Angelei said. “He was a great shooter. He was a bruiser; he was a banger. He knew how to use his body well to get his shot off over his bigger opponents.”</p>\n<p>While Mark played the forward position, Angelei is an extremely versatile player, playing all positions for UCSB, from the point guard to the post.</p>\n<p>“I think it goes back to winning,” Mark said. “If you want to win, you’ll do whatever it takes. That means being a good defender, being able to pass the ball and play any position a coach puts you in. She’s really worked at being a complete basketball player and that’s what came out is that she’s able to play all positions.”</p>\n<p>According to Mark, this may be possible due to her high basketball IQ, which comes from the fact that Angelei has been around basketball for so long.</p>\n<p>“After you see something so much, you have an early knowledge of it,” Mark said. “When you’re talking that kind of lingo, it rubs off on you.”</p>\n<p>On offense, Angelei is a pass-first, score-second type of player; she averages 1.7 assists per game, which is third on the team.</p>\n<p>“You can only be a passer if you’re a shooter because people can’t double off of you,” Mitchell said. “People know she can knock down that 15-foot shot. They know she’ll take it off the dribble, so that allows her to be a better passer.”</p>\n<p>While very different from Mark, Angelei’s unselfish offensive mentality may stem from working out with her dad. If there was one piece of advice he wanted to give Angelei growing up, it was how to respect the game.</p>\n<p>“When I say respect the game, it’s the fact that it’s more than about you,” Mark said. “You can’t say I want to play, but not be committed to being at practice, working hard, trying to be a teammate, trying to make yourself better and trying to make your teammates better.”</p>\n<p>Described by both her dad and coach as the “ultimate teammate,” Angelei only scores when her team really needs her to, tallying 5.7 points per game, although she averages an impressive 46.6 percent from the field in conference play.</p>\n<p>Angelei’s biggest scoring nights, in fact, have come when her team’s back is against the wall. For example, against USC, Angelei put the team on her back in the second half to get her team back in the game, scoring a career-high 13 points.</p>\n<p>“I do what I need to do for the team to win,” Angelei said. “I try to let the game come to me and take what the defense will give me. If I have an open shot, I’ll take it, but I don’t go out of my way.”</p>\n<p>Yet, despite how quickly Angelei and Mark are to say how little they have in common as players, it’s hard not to notice a few similarities.</p>\n<p>For one, Angelei wears number 24 for UCSB, the same number her dad wore in college at DePaul and for Dallas.</p>\n<p>In addition, both have proven they can win. Mark has a couple titles to his name, winning back-to-back NBA championships with the Detroit Pistons.</p>\n<p>Angelei has also won several championships, the most recent coming last year when UCSB earned its Big West Tournament Championship crown. In fact, Angelei was one of the main players Mitchell credited as playing a major role in the victory. In the championship, Angelei recorded what, at the time, was her career-high with nine points and tied her career-high in rebounds with seven.</p>\n<p>“She was just coming back (from an injury) and working her way back into shape,” Mitchell said. “We were able to utilize her at that four spot, which opened it up for Tilleman and Sweets on the inside.”</p>\n<p>Throughout her career, Angelei has proven she can win at every level. In high school, she led her team to four straight Section 1-AA championships. As a Gaucho, along with last year’s tournament championship crown, Santa Barbara won the Big West regular season title in 2010-11 in Angelei’s first season in a UCSB uniform.</p>\n<p>“She’s always won, no matter what team she’s been on,” Mark said. “She’s what basketball should be. You go out there with four other people and you’re trying to win the game. That’s the way she plays.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Photo by Magali Gaulthier / Daily Nexus</h6>\n<h6>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of February 27th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50384\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50384\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/like-father-like-daughter/","id":642,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[641,640,639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go For 41st Straight Over CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After continuing its streak against Northridge last Saturday, winning its 13th straight against the Matadors, the UCSB women’s basketball team has another winning streak to defend tonight when the t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After continuing its streak against Northridge last Saturday, winning its 13th straight against the Matadors, the UCSB women’s basketball team has another winning streak to defend tonight when the team tries for its 41st consecutive victory over Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Dating back to the 1995-96 season, the win streak is the second best nationwide, trailing only Stanford’s 53 straight victories over Washington State.

Nevertheless, UCSB knows it cannot take any team for granted.</p>\n<p>“It’s not like we are going in to this game undefeated,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Our kids understand that different teams present different problems and we had our hands full with Fullerton last time, so there’s absolutely no reason to overlook them.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met in the Thunderdome, UCSB took an early lead, but gave it up in the second half. With the score knotted up at 40, Mitchell made a five man line change, subbing in the reserves. They finished the game on a 12-4 run and earned UCSB a 60-50 win.</p>\n<p>“We got complacent going into the second half,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “That [can’t] happen, especially at the end of the season. Every team is vying for that spot at the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, a glaring statistic for the Gauchos was rebounding as the Titans outrebounded Santa Barbara 40-30, including 20-4 on the offensive glass, which resulted in 23 second chance points for Fullerton compared to just four for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Therefore, rebounding will most likely be the biggest key to the game for the Gauchos. The Titans rank third in the Big West in rebounding margin at +1.6 and lead the conference in offensive boards with 17.9 per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB features two of the best rebounders in the conference as senior forward Sweets Underwood ranks fourth in the league with 9.4 rebounds per game and Tilleman ranks ninth with 7.1.</p>\n<p>Tilleman and Underwood will be crucial for the Gauchos inside offensively as well, as Fullerton is a smaller team known for its quick guards. In the last matchup, Tilleman scored a season-high 16 points on 4-7 shooting and the two combined for 26 points.</p>\n<p>“Our philosophy is always inside out and we understand that when we establish our inside game early, it makes it a lot easier for our guards to get open jumpers,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is set for 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50402\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50402\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/gauchos-go-for-41st-straight-over-csuf/","id":643,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[642,641,640],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
