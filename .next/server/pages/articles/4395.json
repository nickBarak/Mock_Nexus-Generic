The two parties began discussions to settle the lawsuit at the end of July. He ultimately filed to dismiss the lawsuit on Oct. 13, and the court accepted the dismissal on Oct. 16, according to the Santa Barbara County online court record database.</p>\n<p>In the lawsuit, Pragin alleges that the CSD’s Formation Committee discussed financial revenue, such as grants and donations, when it was only authorized to discuss the CSD’s financial structure, such as banking.</p>\n<p>A charter is a document listing what a committee may discuss during its meetings.</p>\n<p>Pragin said he set three conditions for dismissing the lawsuit during the negotiation process.</p>\n<p>The first is that the scope of the Formation Committee’s work be defined more clearly in its charter. According to the CSD’s lawyer G. Ross Trindle, the CSD addressed this concern by signing Resolution 17-1 on July 11 with a unanimous vote of the board.</p>\n<p>The resolution outlines the CSD subcommittees’ roles, including the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>The resolution added the ability to find sources for funding to the committee’s powers.</p>\n<p>“That resolution, in my mind, addressed the … concerns that Mr. Pragin’s complaint attempted to raise,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>The second condition Pragin requested when dismissing the lawsuit is a statement from the board recognizing that they violated the Formation Committee’s initial charter.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the CSD plans to make a statement on the lawsuit at the next regularly scheduled board meeting on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>Pragin’s last request before dismissing the case was to recuperate the costs he suffered from the litigation.</p>\n<p>He said he spent approximately $1,200 pursuing the lawsuit against the district.</p>\n<p>Pragin dismissed the cases without receiving compensation; he lost eligibility to have his costs reimbursed when he decided to represent himself in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>According to federal law, if a person representing themselves in court is not a lawyer they are unable to be awarded attorney’s fees if they win their case.</p>\n<p>Pragin told the <em>Nexus</em> he attempted to address the alleged violations at the Formation Committee’s public meeting but said all the committee members agreed he was incorrect in his claims against the district.</p>\n<p>He said he felt the committee did not take his claims seriously.</p>\n<p>“I stopped feeling like a constituent of theirs,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trindle said in an email he thought it was “unfortunate” that Pragin felt his only option was filing a lawsuit but said it is important that the district can now focus on improving I.V. for its residents.</p>\n<p>CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday evening that he and the other board members are committed to the importance of transparency and public participation.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman recused himself from all closed sessions discussing the lawsuit to avoid a possible conflict of interest stemming from his long-term friendship. Pragin also served as Freeman’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/\">“campaign philosopher”</a> for the 2016 Santa Barbara County Supervisor race.</p>\n<p>In addition to the lawsuit, Pragin said he has also served the district and its subcommittees with three letters citing violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the law that sets the rules for open meetings of government boards and the communications between board members.</p>\n<p>According to Pragin, two of the complaints were answered and corrected and one was answered and disputed.</p>\n<p>Two of the alleged violations were served in April and the other in May.</p>\n<p>One of his letters dated April 20 claimed the CSD illegally created an ad hoc committee by making a committee that discussed “continuing subject matter jurisdiction,” arguing that the contents the committee discussed made it ineligible to be ad hoc.</p>\n<p>Bertrand responded in a letter a month later saying the board rescinded the action that first created the ad hoc committee and passed a new motion that created it once more with a more fitting description of its powers.</p>\n<p>The second letter, also dated April 20, alleged directors George Thurlow and Bob Geis had a side conversation during a regular board meeting of the CSD to plan their next meeting of the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>Geis, chair of the Formation Committee, disputed the claim in a letter stating the committee did not believe the action warranted a commitment to cease and desist and that such an action would lead to a “burdensome limitation.”</p>\n<p>The letter dated May 9 claimed members of the Formation Committee failed to publicly notice, adjourn or show up to a public meeting.</p>\n<p>Geis responded in a letter a week later stating the committee “unconditionally commits” to ceasing, desisting and refusing to repeat the offense Pragin stated in his letter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-69844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Abboud said his first order of business is to have a meeting with board members to discuss their goals. He said he chose to apply because he believes in I.V. self-governance and hopes to bring his experience in advocacy, lobbying, fundraising and “navigating bureaucracies” to the district.</p>\n<p>“I want to be general manager to make sure that the CSD is successful in its first year in establishing itself, establishing its role in the community, making relationships built in the community and having a good reputation as a voice for change and good change in I.V. and I feel like I am well-suited to do that,” he said in a phone interview with the <em>Nexus </em>Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Abboud, a 2014 UC Santa Barbara alumnus, also plans to strengthen the district’s finances and find an independent revenue stream.</p>\n<p>He was a primary organizer for Isla Vista self-governance and directed the Yes on E &amp; F campaign for board elections in the CSD.</p>\n<p>The CSD will pay Abboud $4,000 from its professional development fund and may pay more based on his success in acquiring grants, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>Board member Spencer Brandt said the CSD plans to hire a full-time general manager when the district receives additional funding.</p>\n<p>In February 2016, the Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative estimated the general manager salary would be $162,500. In March, before a tax to fund the CSD failed, First District Supervisor Das Williams estimated the salary for a General Manager position would cost $100,000 annually.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. CSD has acquired a general manager at 6 percent of cost estimated in the 2015 Isla Vista Governance Options Financial Analysis Study,” Brandt said. “We are proving that we can do a lot with a little.”</p>\n<p>At a press conference Wednesday afternoon at People’s Park, Bertrand said the general manager’s role will be to execute the board’s policies, but ultimately it is the board’s duty to create policies, develop procedures and oversee finances.</p>\n<p>Bertrand added that the CSD is drafting a contract for the general manager’s role. The CSD’s lawyer, G. Ross Trindle, said the contract will become public when the details have been negotiated and finalized.</p>\n<p>The CSD hired Abboud through his consulting company which he created Sept. 17, two weeks after the application deadline for the position, according to California state records. He is the only employee of the firm and said he created the company so he could accept the position as general manager.</p>\n<p>According to Trindle, the district’s revenue stream would be unable to support salaries and benefits for a public employee. And, because it can’t sustain a payroll system, the CSD hired its general manager through a firm.</p>\n<p>“Having an Interim General Manager on a contract basis via a consultant allows the District to receive the general manager services it needs to function more efficiently to deliver much-needed services to District residents,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>In a Tuesday press release, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand praised Abboud’s service to I.V. and called it “an honor” to have him as general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday that there were only two applicants to the position, Abboud Consulting, LLC and Lechowicz &amp; Tseng Municipal Consultants, LLC – an Oakland consulting firm formed in March, according to state records.</p>\n<p>Lechowicz &amp; Tseng requested “significantly more” pay than what Abboud requested, Bertrand said, though that fact did not impact the decision since, ultimately, the group removed themselves from the applicant pool.</p>\n<p>The government consulting firm removed itself from the pool after the beginning of the application review process. Bertrand said the group was more focused on finances and strategic planning than the “general management” of the district.</p>\n<p>Abboud said his firm has no clients but has previously worked in acquiring grants and helped the CSD apply for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation.</p>\n<p>Abboud is currently on the board of directors for the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation, an I.V. nonprofit that coordinates funding for the CSD.</p>\n<p>When asked whether this influenced the decision to hire Abboud, Bertrand said he is not legally allowed to speak on the deliberations for a general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also said the CSD plans to release over 100 pages of documents from the application and review process.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the main focus he has for the CSD is to envision its future and lay down a plan for what is to come.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s conference, he said his plan was never to stay in I.V. after completing his undergraduate degree, but instead to “do something more traditional.” However, the creation of the CSD drove him to remain in I.V. in order to make it a better place.</p>\n<p>“That’s been the most proud work of my life that I’ve worked on, and it’s such a joy to now be able to have worked on creating this district and now to be able to work on executing the district’s vision,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Oct. 12, 12:30 a.m.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Most recycled water is non-potable, or unsafe for drinking. Non-potable water is used primarily for irrigation of plants not intended for consumption.</p>\n<p>The project will install “purple pipes,” a type of pipe that carries recycled water in an environmentally-conscious way. The project will stretch from Embarcadero Del Norte south to People’s Park, Perfect Park, Little Acorn Park and the nearby areas.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, the newly appointed IVRPD director, made the motion to authorize staff to work on the project at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock, a fourth-year sociology and economics double major, told the <em>Nexus</em> last Thursday that one of his goals as a director would be to install the infrastructure needed to provide recycled water.</p>\n<p>The recycled water project is a step toward fulfilling the promises IVRPD board members made when campaigning for “yes” on Measure O.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/budgets/17-18%20Approved%20Final%20Budget%20Formatted.pdf\">According to its budget</a>, the IVRPD estimates it will receive $256,358 in tax revenue because the measure passed in May.</p>\n<p>The parks district said earlier this year it would use the funds to address a “backlog of deferred maintenance” in its parks as well as bring reclaimed water to I.V.</p>\n<p>“Every single one of us has knocked on the door and said this is a thing we’ve wanted to do,” IVRPD Director Carlos López said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/board-agenda/agenda/2017/BrdAgenda%20October%2012%202017.pdf\">According to IVRPD’s Oct. 12 agenda</a>, the parks district asked the Goleta Water District if it would be interested in entering an agreement to provide stable water rates if the district chose to install purple pipes in the park.</p>\n<p>The water district said in an attachment to last week’s meeting agenda that the rates are determined by studies and that any agreement must comply with the current water rate, though reclaimed water cannot be charged at a higher rate than the cost for providing it.</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said investing in this type of water comes with risks because the rates could change at any moment or the water district could choose to stop offering recycled water.</p>\n<p>He reassured board members that the idea was likely “safe enough, but that there is no guarantee the rates will not change or that water will continue to be offered. Board members agreed and authorized the decision through a unanimous vote.</p>\n<p>At their meeting, the IVRPD also moved forward with a number of park improvement projects, including a new irrigation project for Sueno Park’s orchards and installing power to People’s Park to host bands and festivals.</p>\n<p>According to the board’s agenda, the project to bring irrigation to Sueno Park will cost approximately $5,700<strong>. </strong>Diane Dodds, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus, donated $2,000 to the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>The board also approved the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) to use their parks to host the newly-expanded Community Service Escort program. The service district’s board of directors voted to expand the program to increase safety in I.V. in September.</p>\n<p>The CSD will work with CSOs by setting up tents near highly-frequented areas on weekends so community service officers may provide escorts to anybody who requests service.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD board of directors meets every second Thursday of the month from 6 to 8 p.m. in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Cooperative.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article previously said the IVRPD would install potable water.
