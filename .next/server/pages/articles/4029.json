virtually in order to mitigate transmissions of coronavirus, and the Regents called upon public commenters who had signed up to speak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 300,000</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people have contracted coronavirus and at least 13,000 have died, including more than 1,300 infections and 25 deaths in California as of 7 p.m. Saturday, according to information from </span><a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johns Hopkins University</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those numbers will continue to rise rapidly, according to Carrie Byington, executive vice president of UC Health, who spoke at the meeting. To combat the ongoing surge of cases, Byington said the university must “flatten the curve” of coronavirus transmissions through tactics such as social isolation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The modelers for this COVID-19 infection predict, on the low end, 30% of the world’s population becoming infected and 70% on the high end over the course of a year,” Byington said. “That is billions of people and will result in millions of infections in the United States.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hospital facilities that we have in the state of California, that we have across the UC, that we have in the United States, will be overwhelmed if these models are not slowed down through social mitigation,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Universities across the country, including </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have transitioned to remote instruction to mitigate the spread of coronavirus through social distancing. All UCs are also canceling various in-person events on their campuses, according to Rachael Nava, the UC’s executive vice president.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to coronavirus’ rapid rate of infection, the UC will need to respond quickly to issues regarding the disease as they arise, according to Nava.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This situation is very fluid, it’s changing practically from minute to minute,” she said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of individuals who contract coronavirus will recover, possibly without showing any symptoms, but about 20% of those with the virus will require hospitalization and up to 5% may require intensive care, according to Byington.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monica Martinez, a 19-year clinical care partner at the UC Los Angeles Medical Center, voiced concern to the Regents about the decreasing number of available beds in the hospital.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our unit is always full and we always have a shortage of beds,” she said. “We must extend our capacity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents also heard from Laurence Young, a UCSB librarian who said he is concerned about the “sluggish” reaction to coronavirus and the University Library’s in-person operations potentially enabling the spread of coronavirus. Later in the day, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2020-03-18-covid-19-update-test-results-and-library-services\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the library would be closed beginning Thursday, with no cited date to reopen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB is the largest employer in Santa Barbara and many of us, especially in the library, live paycheck to paycheck,” Young said. He requested that the university “ensure that anyone who cannot work during this crisis receives full administrative leave with pay.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding paid administrative leave for library staff, but UC President Janet Napolitano issued an </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/uc-president-extends-employees-paid-leave-with-executive-order/\"><span

this weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A series sweep over the University of Illinois at Chicago opened up with the Gauchos earning their fourth-straight win as well as their third shutout of the young season, punctuated by a Nick Vogt 10th-inning walk-off RBI single late Friday night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB sent sophomore lefty Rodney Boone to the mound on Friday, who was set to battle it out with UIC’s Jacob Key. Key stifled the Gauchos all the way until junior Gianni Bloom’s sac-fly would score junior Jason Willow in the seventh inning. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Steele Ledford, whose single to the right side had moved Willow over to third, would then score on an error, giving the Gauchos a 2-1 lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicagoan Joshua Figueroa then hit a shot off Boone in the eighth to tie it back up at 2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boone would finish the night with 7.1 innings tossed, 3 hits, 2 runs, 1 walk and a career-high 12 strikeouts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Come the tenth inning, Head Coach Andrew Checketts would look to freshman Vogt with 2 outs against the Gauchos to drive home sophomore Christian Kirtley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a hit-and-run with Willow just prior, though, and Vogt was tasked with putting the ball in play just after junior Marcos Castanon singled to give the Gauchos runners at first and second base. There was 1 out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Willow grounded out to short, but the execution of the hit-and-run was nothing short of spectacular, and UCSB now had runners on first and third for the young man out of Woodland, California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vogt lined a single up the middle for a walk-off win over the Flames. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Vogt really did, however, was open the can of worms that was the UCSB offense. The Gauchos won both of the next two games with a combined score of 25-1, completing the sweep over UIC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaucho pitching staff, despite how remarkably committed and motivated the lineup is, has just been a bit more consistent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s offense has a low/high record of 1 and 17 runs, respectively, while their pitching staff has surrendered a low/high of 0 and 7. UCSB has given up two runs or less in eight of their eleven games thus far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for that reason, it can be quite interesting to analyze what exactly it is that sparks the hitting bug. Where does it come from? Why is it contagious? The Gauchos did something pretty special in game three, but more on that later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, the Flames tasked Bobby Nicholson with leading the charge as they sought redemption for Friday night’s fiasco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho junior Zach Torra continued his torrid form with 12 punchouts and a shutout, making for 25 strikeouts in his last two starts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was UCSB’s third shutout of the season and they can credit their well-roundedness for that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos scored 10 runs off a .250 clip with 10 RBIs and an almost even K/BB ratio at 6/8. Sophomore first-baseman Kyle Johnson and Castanon both had multihit performances, including a 5-RBI day for Castanon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB topped UIC 10-0 to take the series with a game to play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday was more of the same, as the Gauchos steamrolled the Flames to a 15-1 pounding that saw UCSB bat around in the seventh inning. They rolled out 15 batters en route to a victory that sent a message: They’re here, and they’re here to play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have stomped their opponents and made them look silly in the box, held out for the one-run games, hit a walk-off, have won in extras and so much more. They’ve played small ball, and they’ve looked like a modern MLB team, such as in this final game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kirtley and Vogt continued their fine weekends and each accounted for 2 more Gaucho RBIs, with shortstop McClain O’Connor contributing the final knock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will have a short rest as top-10 UCLA comes to town on Tuesday night. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93228\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-02/ucsb-baseball-sweeps-uic-set-to-host-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93228\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-02/ucsb-baseball-sweeps-uic-set-to-host-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-02/ucsb-baseball-sweeps-uic-set-to-host-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-02/ucsb-baseball-sweeps-uic-set-to-host-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-02/ucsb-baseball-sweeps-uic-set-to-host-ucla/","id":4027,"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro"},"related":[4026,4025,4024],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBC Public Health Department Announces Six New Cases of Coronavirus, First Positive Cases in South County","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2020-03-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Until today, no cases of coronavirus had been announced in South County. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department confirmed six new cases of coronavirus on Thursday, adding to the three cases that were confirmed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/128-coronavirus-tests-administered-in-santa-barbara-county-public-officials-discuss-testing-protocols/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier this week.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Two of the new cases are North County residents, both in their 30s, according to a <a href=\"https://publichealthsbc.org/covid19/additional-cases-of-covid-19-confirmed-in-santa-barbara-county/\">press release</a> from the SB County Public Health Department.
