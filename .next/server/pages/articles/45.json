Gilbertson’s win over Saltzen increased her already team-leading record of 17 singles match victories to 18.</p>\n<p>Baker delivered the final blow to Cal Poly after defeating senior Sayaka Tsugai 6-3, 6-1, and the Gauchos officially became the winners of the women’s tennis Blue-Green rivalry three years in a row.</p>\n<p>Both Da Silveira and Baker were participants in last year’s Blue-Green rivalry, and it was good to see both players make significant contributions to this year’s rivalry in the form of picking up a victory in doubles and singles play.</p>\n<p>The win over Cal Poly marked the seventh-straight victory for the Gauchos, a streak that began on April 2 with a 4-1 win over Cal State Northridge. The seven-straight victories are the primary reason the Gauchos are where they are in the conference currently.</p>\n<p>During the seven-game streak, the team was able to beat six conference opponents, which allowed for the Gauchos to improve on the 1-1 record they had before the month of April.</p>\n<p>Their play on this hot streak has resembled the play of last season when the team won the Big West Championships, and they are hoping to carry their current momentum into the tournament to win the title two seasons in a row.</p>\n<p>In order to have the right to share the Big West Conference title, the Gauchos needed to get a win over the Cal Poly Mustangs and a loss by Hawaii to Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB won its match this weekend, the Rainbow Warriors were able to get by a tough Titan team, winning their match 4-0. The Gauchos will enter the tournament at the No. 2 seed without the Big West title they won just a year ago.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will travel to Indian Wells to kick off the Big West Championships, playing their first game on Friday, April 28, with a time and opponent yet to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/","id":45,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[44,43,42],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Go Undefeated in Utah, Return Home for Gaucho Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-FILEPHOTO-DH-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Facing a must-win situation as the Big West schedule gradually comes closer, the UCSB softball team swept each opponent at the St. George Red Desert Classic.

With the Mavericks only recording four hits throughout the game, UCSB capitalized by getting the run it needed to win in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Following Sunday’s game, the Gauchos are now 3-0 when playing in extra innings.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos got out to a sluggish start against Southern Utah, giving up three early runs in the top of the first inning. For Southern Utah, senior first baseman Karlee Manzione homered and brought three runs in, allowing her teammates senior infielder/outfielder Payton Hart and junior outfielder Sarah Murphy to score.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasn’t fazed, however, as they answered back in the bottom of the first, starting with sophomore second baseman Sierra Altmeyer’s homer, which brought junior outfielder Jessica Johnston in to score as well.</p>\n<p>Both teams were off to fast starts, and the game sat at 3-2 Thunderbirds following the first inning. The Gauchos went on in the bottom of the second to tie the game 3-3 with the help of a single by Hinojosa, bringing freshman infielder Kayla Krantz in to score a run.</p>\n<p>After some scoreless innings for both teams, the Gauchos secured a one-run lead in the fifth. At this point the Gauchos held all the momentum, keeping the Thunderbirds at bay thanks to junior pitcher Lena Mayer, who got her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>With a shot from Johnston, Hinojosa was brought in, securing the Gauchos’ 5-3 victory over the Thunderbirds. Johnston went 4-4 at the plate during this, including bringing in Clark for a run with a single up the middle.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Gauchos faced off against a Nevada team that would be shut out in five innings by Gulvin, who earned 10 strikeouts. After two innings, the teams were tied at 0-0, but in the third a wild pitch from Nevada saw UCSB senior third baseman Emily Brucelas score. Brucelas went on to bring in Altmeyer for a 2-0 lead. Soon after, freshman infielder Whitney Pemberton brought in Hinojosa with a single.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of fifth, Nevada still scoreless at this point, the Gauchos increased their lead to 5-0 with contributions from Diaz and Altmeyer off of a sacrifice fly from junior infielder Samantha Lujan and a single from Brucelas, who went a perfect 3-3 at bat.</p>\n<p>Nevada finally scored with an effort from junior outfielder Aaliyah Gibson, allowing senior outfielder Raquel Martinez to score the sole run for the Wolf Pack. Beating Nevada 5-1, the Gauchos built off of momentum from their two wins Friday.</p>\n<p>On Friday, UCSB looked to keep things rolling against Iowa State following the morning win against Utah Valley. The Gauchos got on the board early with the help of Pemberton’s solo homer in the top of the second inning. In the bottom of the third, the Cyclones tied up the game with a run from senior outfielder Cathlin Bingham.</p>\n<p>The next three innings saw the advancement of a 4-1 Gaucho lead, beginning with a run from Pemberton in the fourth. In the fifth, Pemberton’s fourth double of the day saw Johnston score to establish a 3-1 lead. The Gauchos continued with another run in the sixth, thanks to a sac fly by Clark’s, which brought freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez home to make the game 4-1.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, the game appeared to be coming to a close. However, the Cyclones rallied with the help of a single from sophomore catcher Kaylee Bosworth and a homer from freshman infielder Talyn Lewis. With the game now a close 4-3, freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega came up big for the Gauchos with a final strikeout for her first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Friday, the Gauchos competed against a talented Utah Valley team, squeezing a 9-7 win over the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>Following the second inning, the Wolverines were up 4-0 after a four-run inning. Pemberton finally got the Gauchos on the board with a double in the fourth to bring Altmeyer home. Following two runs from Clark and freshman catcher Nyssa Williams, at a second at bat in the fourth Pemberton doubled to bring in Altmeyer and Johnston for a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines used some momentum to rally and score three runs in the bottom of the sixth, making the game 7-5. Down two runs in the seventh, UCSB needed to come up big to secure a win, and they did just that. Pemberton made her presence felt again, hitting a double to bring Johnston home to make the score 7-6.</p>\n<p>Following a Krantz strikeout and with two outs on the board, UCSB rallied to make the game 9-7 with hits from Lujan and Hinojosa, allowing Altmeyer, Brucelas and Pemberton to score at home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos not only came up big on offense in the seventh, but they also shut out Utah Valley in the final inning to win the high-scoring game 9-7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 9-10 thanks to their 5-0 sweep in Utah. They will look to continue that energy as they play host to teams in the Gaucho Classic, which will tip off Saturday, March 11 at 1:30 p.m. at Campus Diamond. The Gauchos will play Sacred Heart to open their weekend and will also face George Washington, San Diego and Northern Colorado twice over the course of the Classic.</p><div

UCSB will now come home and host another five games in a three-day duration during the first Gaucho Classic, beginning this Saturday, March 11.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, now 9-10 overall after five wins,

She’s thrown a team-high 34 innings, starting in every one of her appearances this year.

USD will have already played Northern Colorado, UCSB’s final opponent for the weekend, earlier Sunday morning, giving the Gauchos an edge in terms of rested legs.</p>\n<p>The offense has been up and down for San Diego, though sophomores Taylor Spence (outfielder) and Lauren Kane (corner infielder) have supplied the team with consistent options atop the lineup.</p>\n<p>Spence is slashing .381/.447/.429, followed closely by Kane whose line stands at .375/.432/.525. The two have combined for nine RBI, six doubles, eight walks and 12 runs, and Kane has even gotten herself a triple in the season’s early going.</p>\n<p>Senior righty Megan Sabbatini leads the team with 47.2 innings pitched, more than double Lauren Berriatua (senior) who has the team’s second most. She’s been shaky in all those innings, however, racking up a 5.73 ERA, 3-6 record, allowing 10 home runs and a .333 opponent batting average.</p>\n<p>UCSB ends the Classic with a doubleheader against a less than formidable opponent in Northern Colorado, losers of three straight, on Monday, March 13, with the back-to-back games starting at 1 p.m. The Bears come into this matchup with only a 5-14 overall record thus far.</p>\n<p>The Bears again receive their main hitting contributions from the dynamic duo of senior Erica Dick (infielder) and sophomore Jordyn Wiatrack (catcher/infielder).</p>\n<p>Dick has slashed .333/.394/.550 with three homers, three other extra-base hits, and eight RBI, while Wiatrack has crushed four home runs of her own, a team high, and leads the squad with 12 RBI and 36 total bases.</p>\n<p>Senior Jayme Reddacliff is the only consistent option for the Bears on the mound, already having thrown for an eye-popping 63.1 innings on the season. Her 5.12 ERA and .306 opponent batting average are red flags, though, especially when juxtaposed with her 4-8 record. Northern Colorado figures to provide the Gauchos with an easier opponent to conclude their first weekend of home games in 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB showed a continued ability to win close games this past weekend with four of their wins coming by fewer than three runs. Though the strategy is not a statistically sustainable one, the grit of this Gaucho team does not go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer is up to four home runs, three doubles and 11 RBI on the season, and freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston are both up to two home runs and 11 and 7 RBI respectively. The power hitting is starting to come around for a Gaucho team that was in desperate need of deep ball hitters.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Veronika Gulvin was able to up her record to 6-4 over this past weekend and get her ERA below four (it now stands at 3.82).</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega (1-4, 7.81 ERA) is still a questionable option behind her, but Gulvin has begun to prove that she is the ace this team was pining for.</p>\n<p>After catching their first wave of consistent winning play this season in Utah last weekend, the Gauchos will try to continue the trend back in sunny Santa Barbara at their first hosted tournament of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts the Gaucho Classic I beginning at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 11, at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The mid-game outpouring would again be sufficient for the Gauchos, as Noriega would allow the team’s only run, notching her second win of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next game against San Diego on Sunday would prove more difficult than the weekend’s first two contests, though the Gauchos still collected their third win of the weekend 7-4. After taking a 2-1 lead in the fifth, a high-scoring sixth inning would tantalize those in attendance.</p>\n<p>Two singles to start the inning from sophomore left fielder Taylor Spence and junior right fielder Kailey Hill opened the floodgates for the Toreros. They capitalized later in the inning with back-to-back, two-out doubles, one off the bat of freshman shortstop Sara Silveyra, followed by one from freshman catcher Madison Casiano, scoring all Spence, Silveyra, and freshman outfielder Savannah Shields, who pinch ran for Hill.</p>\n<p>Gulvin would get the Gauchos out of the inning, setting up a wild bottom of the sixth. Junior center fielder Jessica Johnston came ready to play, slamming a triple down the first base line to open the frame. Diaz was next up, hitting Johnston home on a sacrifice fly to left.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer continued her hot streak, doubling to right center field, and scoring two batters later on a single from Lujan. With the game now tied 4-4, Menor singled to left, advancing Lujan to second. After a series of substitutions from both teams, pinch hitting freshman infielder Genesis Ramirez loaded the bases on an infield single to the shortstop, Silveyra.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then rallied off three quick runs, the first on a bases-loaded walk, the second again on an infield single to the shortstop and the third on yet another infield single, this time to the pitcher. Senior right fielder Jacqueline Hinojosa, senior left fielder Kristen Clark, and Johnston were responsible for the three RBI (Johnston got her second at bat of the inning).</p>\n<p>Gulvin was credited with the victory, moving to 8-4, and Noriega’s one inning of work earned her the first save of her season.</p>\n<p>Northern Colorado defeated the Gauchos twice Monday, 6-5 the first game and 7-1 in the second, dropping their record to 12-12 overall. The decisive inning in the former was the top of the fifth, in which sophomore third baseman Jordyn Wiatrak hit a grand slam after senior shortstop Erica Dick knocked in two batters on a double to left center.</p>\n<p>The first loss was credited to Gulvin, while Noriega would collect the second. After drawing initial blood in the bottom of the first with a sacrifice fly from Altmeyer that scored Menor, the Gauchos would allow seven-straight runs, never showing much promise for the rest of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>UCSB should absolutely be happy with the weekend, however, as the season starts anew, so to speak, with the Gauchos heading into the rest of the season 12-12. Next up for Santa Barbara will be Oklahoma and Loyola Marymount on Thursday, Mar. 16, with the latter hosting in Los Angeles.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76513\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/gauchos-dominate-first-three-games-of-gaucho-classic-i-drop-final-two-against/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76513\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/gauchos-dominate-first-three-games-of-gaucho-classic-i-drop-final-two-against/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/gauchos-dominate-first-three-games-of-gaucho-classic-i-drop-final-two-against/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/gauchos-dominate-first-three-games-of-gaucho-classic-i-drop-final-two-against/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/gauchos-dominate-first-three-games-of-gaucho-classic-i-drop-final-two-against/","id":44,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[43,42,41],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
