After all, it was in the original opening crawl: a bunch of rebels steal the Death Star plans. So the inherent question here is this: How can a film possibly entertain when one already knows the outcome?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer to that comes partially on the strength of its characters. In lieu of Jedi going on journeys of self-discovery or contrived romances, we have a dirtier story with a group of soldiers who look like they could use a good shower by the end. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is a prisoner of the Empire, rescued and tasked by the Rebel Alliance to track down her father Galen Erso, essentially the Robert Oppenheimer of this universe, so that they may find the plans to the Death Star and subsequently blow it up. Along the way, she and rebel operative Cassian Andor drag some fellow colorful badasses into their fight against the space Nazis and Imperial sleaze-ball Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn).  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones brings a sufficient degree of capability to Jyn. The character can fend for herself and gradually learns to hope again in the midst of a war, although her reactions to some events do seem to be a bit tepid at times. Cassian is also gifted with a subtle complexity, as he bounces back between ruthlessness and sentiment.  Also included in the camaraderie of space warriors includes the dry-witted droid K-2SO and likable, blind super-badass Chirrut Îmwe</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(played by Donnie Yen, aka the Ip Man), who are welcome additions to the saga. Expect to see the Mouse milk them for all they’re worth in merchandising.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side of the fight, Mendelsohn’s Krennic comes across as quite a unique villain in the film series. Unlike the typical evil space wizards we’ve become accustomed to seeing, he’s not really looking for power, despite being in charge of the Death Star. He’s just some egotistical boot-licker who wants Palpatine to pat him on the head and make him feel special. Thrawn he is not, but still a breath of fresh air he is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the film does suffer from the fact that it has a fairly large cast and only two hours to develop them. Besides Jyn, nobody else gets a lot of time to establish how they reached where they are today and why they make the choices they do. And if any of you are “Clone Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fans, you’ll be scratching your heads about how Saw Gerrera went from freeing the oppressed to leading a group of rebel extremists that toss grenades into crowded marketplaces, although apparently “Rebels” might address that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plot-wise, “Rogue One”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does feel sort of familiar. Despite the fact that we’ve already seen two Star Wars movies about getting important information to the rebellion, the film</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enraptures on the strength of its sense of scale and battle scenes.  Director Gareth Edwards, who rose to prominence for directing “Godzilla,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proves once again that he knows how to utilize scale to great effect. Spaceships and planets feel appropriately massive and intimidating. Even when tiny characters are framed against a gigantic explosion, you still feel the dread of it as it chases after the rebels.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when the action gets going, by god does it deliver. The film’s final battle scene, from a pure entertainment standpoint, felt supremely satisfying — even more than the battles in “The Force Awakens.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sweeping war scene spans the land, air and space on a scale never before seen in a Star Wars film, and its conclusion ties neatly into “A New Hope</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some have commented about this being the first Star Wars film to be truly about war and its consequences. I’d say aside from the clichéd trope of a child crying in the midst of a firefight standing around like they’re waiting to be shot, you’re not going to find any commentary about the meaning of war or the like. This is still an action blockbuster after all.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s only so much more I can discuss here without spoiling something.  There are plenty of callbacks to all eras of Star Wars: the originals, the prequels and even the TV show “Rebels</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether or not you’re familiar with any of these, “Rogue One”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can still stand apart as a fun film in its own right. It divorces itself from the traditional Star Wars formula while staying firmly rooted in its universe, making it quite the rogue one. Ah. I see what they did there.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No he didn’t. He read that on Wookiepedia.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Spoilerish</b> <b>addendum</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (read at thy own risk): I wrote this review before Carrie Fisher passed away. The timing of her death has caused Leia’s appearance at the film’s end to transform from something that, upon first viewing, just served as a nostalgia-tickling moment but turned into something more bittersweet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we really weren’t actually seeing Fisher receiving the plans (it was her 19-year-old face digitally replacing Ingvild Deila’s), it is sad to consider that this is sort of her last Star Wars movie to have come out when she was alive. It will make seeing her one last time in Episode VIII all the more melancholy and her absence in Episode IX all the more biting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through and through, Carrie Fisher was an icon of Hollywood and sci-fi. Her face was everywhere — on-screen, book covers and, of course, on action figures. Leia was the first badass female movie hero to enter the cultural mainstream; she got by on sass, know-how and proficiency with an assortment of lethal weaponry, helping to turn Fisher into one of the most well-known feminist icons of the screen. Later on in life, she became an advocate for those suffering from addiction and mental illness, becoming one of the most prolific Star Wars alumni to address real-life issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now she is gone and that really sucks, not only because of the gap she leaves behind, but also considering that her passing is yet another reminder that time marches on and bits of our childhood will one day, indeed, evaporate. However, as fans, we’ll some day get over it. Hopefully, at the very least, they will be able to find solace in what a huge inspiration and comfort Carrie Fisher was to people all around the Earth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodbye, Miss Fisher. The world is not quite as awesome without you. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-03/a-rogue-new-step-into-a-larger-world/","id":5837,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5836,5835,5834],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Combatting Sexual Assualt: Taking the Next Step","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Second-year Emily Potter praises the campus organizations that are fighting for real change. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Scattered across the campus and Facebook are police sketches of the two men suspected of committing the past weekend’s act of sexual violence. It was not long before these two faces became familiar to Isla Vista and the campus community, but these two faces fail to represent the hundreds of other unreported perpetrators of sexual violence within our community.</p>\n<p>At the UCSB Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity department, the employees take turns watching over what they call “the survivor hotline,” a cell phone specifically for survivors that they can call to receive immediate assistance. Jill Dunlap, director of the C.A.R.E. program at WGSE informs us that for the past year they are averaging 40 new cases a quarter, all cases combined (sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking). Of those new cases, they average 21 new sexual assault cases reported to them each quarter. To put that into perspective, that is four new cases a week, two of which are sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>Because of the underreporting of sexual violence and the social taboo surrounding the subject, many people remain unaware of just how frequently this crime occurs. The tragic events of the past weekend have somewhat shifted that awareness. The advocates at WGSE have been overwhelmed these past weeks with outreach from student and community organizations asking what they can do to help. They are grateful for the activism, but also want people to be aware of the unfortunate truth that these events are nothing new to them, and hope that the new energy behind the effort to make a difference does not dwindle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The last week of February, UCSB’s Take Back the Night held #TakeBackTheStreets week to “stand together against the racism, misogyny, homophobia, and general bigotry that we are expected to ‘take as a compliment,’” finishing with a rally on Friday that began at Pardall tunnel and ended on Del Playa.

It empowers participants to intervene as a bystander and prevent sexual assault, dating violence and stalking in their communities. The free eight-hour workshop runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with lunch provided. For those unable to commit the time to attend the Green Dot training, C.A.R.E also offers a free one-time, two-hour training through which you can become C.A.R.E Connect certified. This training covers how to help if someone tells you they have been assaulted, how to recognize the signs of an abusive relationship, what resources are available on campus and in the community and what safe and effective actions you can take to make our campus a safer place.</p>\n<p>Having students attend either or both of these training sessions will not only raise awareness, but also educate community members on what they can do to help. The Green Dot and C.A.R.E trainings may be a bigger time commitment than attending a rally, but they offer sustainable and effective ways to reduce the occurrence of sexual assault in our community. Jill Dunlap assures that as long as students show interest in these programs and want to receive the training, they will continue to hold them. To sign up for either of these training programs, email care@sa.ucsb.edu and they will work with you to schedule a time for you to attend.</p>\n<p>For those looking for a more long-term involvement in sexual violence activism, C.A.R.E. also provides a Violence Intervention and Prevention Internship (VIP) program. With the VIP program, interns will work five to seven hours/week throughout the quarter. Their work will provide them with valuable knowledge about interpersonal violence and the skills to educate others and actively prevent violence in their communities. They will also receive a mini-grant to complete an education or prevention based program or campaign that will create change in their own community. To learn more about the VIP program and to apply, visit the VIP program GauchoLink description under the jobs, internships and on-campus interviews tab. All applications are due March 17.</p>\n<p>All of these rallies and intervention programs have one thing in common: A call for the formation of a stronger sense of community. The formation of this community is the only way we can hope to turn this trend around. The residents and business owners of Isla Vista, UCPD, students and campus faculty need to begin to work together to find a solution to this problem. We must not let the discussion die. The responsibility lies with us to prevent sexual violence. While ultimately education will prove to be the only way to truly end sexual violence, awareness and intervention are crucial steps that can be taken now. The UCSB Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity department has been working since 1975 to carry out their vision of a world free of oppression and violence. It is time we join them.</p>\n<p><em>Emily Potter is a second-year literature and sociology major.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, March 6, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Your newspaper recently <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/\">reported</a> on the unlawful assembly that occurred in Isla Vista during the evening hours of Saturday, March 8, 2014. I would like to comment on the responsible actions of a few students who helped law enforcement officers hold back the aggressive crowd as the situation escalated into a near riot.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate incident started with the near-fatal stabbing of a man on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive. As the investigation of the assault continued, a large group of onlookers (many from outside of the I.V. area) gathered on DP. The crowd swelled to several hundred people; one person jumped onto cars and began dancing on them. When he was arrested, the crowd closed in around deputies, chanting and throwing bottles and beer cans at them. Fortunately, a few UCSB students attempted to intervene and stepped forward to assist the deputies in calming the unruly crowd.</p>\n<p>As we know, the dangerous and disrespectful actions of this crowd do not represent the attitudes of the UCSB student body. Instead, what stood out that night was the response of a few upstanding students who supported our deputies in this volatile situation. They realized the danger of the senseless, alcohol-induced group mentality of the moment. They showed a great deal of responsibility, respect and even courage as they did the right thing.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I applaud those students who decided to aid our deputies for their mature decision making, and I hope they will serve as role models to their classmates and to the rest of the community.</p>\n<p><em>Bill Brown is the Santa Barbara County Sheriff and Coroner.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in print in the Monday, March 3, 2014 edition.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

We all know it: That insufferable gambit of individuals, clubs and organizations who set up their tents and shove fliers in our face. Some of us have even been on the other side of the shoving — I know I have. But there is one thing that binds all of these groups together: they are all in the Arbor to promote their cause using the freedom of speech afforded to them by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, as well as the university policy which designates that zone as a 100 percent free-speech zone.</p>\n<p>Now, every so often, the groups that set up shop in the Arbor will be from camps that we as individuals disagree with. For example, recently the pro-life group “Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust,” as well as a particular self-labeled preacher, have taken it upon themselves to share their messages and causes with the student body of our lovely campus. One group did so by showing graphic depictions of abortions, while the other by shouting words contrary to what this university as a whole generally believes to be empirically-supported fact.</p>\n<p>And how did our university’s community respond? Well, an assistant professor and at least two of hir (sex omitted for lack of relevance) students forcibly stole a pro-life sign which was later found in tattered ruins (there is currently no proof to link the professor to the destruction of the sign), and a large gathering of students surrounded this visiting preacher to listen to and hurl insults at him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you were to stop reading here, you might believe me to be an apologist for these two groups, but I promise you that is not my desire. I am writing this instead to raise the question of what is the appropriate response to an opposing opinion. Should we as a community encourage taking away an individual or organization’s ability to voice their perspective? Should we create an environment where it’s acceptable to antagonize someone who voices an opinion that, while unsubstantiated by any empirical evidence, is completely within their right as a citizen to hold? I am careful to say “antagonize” and not “debate,” because I believe that positive, respectful and productive debate can and should be held over these topics. However, this is not the response that I have personally witnessed.</p>\n<p>The reason I single out these two groups over the many others that have visited this campus in my time here as both a student and a staff member is because of their religious motivations. Religious extremists from any particular belief view personal attacks as a form of martyrdom. We fan the flame that motivates these extreme groups when we react at all, let alone when we react negatively. A crowd draws a crowd, and when you sit and poke fun at a group you disagree with, some of your friends might join in and soon enough you have amassed a large circle of people who are there to see what’s going on. At this point, the protester has won because they managed to amass a group of people to listen to their cause. Whether those people agree or not, they feel as though they have accomplished what they came to do.</p>\n<p>I have seen individuals like this traveling pastor and pro-life group visit this campus repeatedly for the past four years and they get a strong reaction from the community every time. To those who feel they are “fighting the good fight” by arguing visibly and loudly with these individuals, it doesn’t appear to be doing anything. You cannot reason with someone who refuses to (or is unable to) use valid reason.</p>\n<p>So next time you see someone with a book in hand, shouting things that any sane person would dismiss as nonsense, if you can’t approach them in an effort to create a healthy debate, maybe you should just keep on walking; let’s not help to build the pulpit this person is hoping to preach from.</p>\n<p><i>Alex Johnson graduated from UCSB in 2013 with a B.A. in sociology and currently works on campus.</i></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in print in the Monday, March 31, 2014 edition.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
