With only 27 seconds left in the period, sophomore driver Carla Carraga tied the score for the Golden Bears with a short-range shot.</p>\n<p>Cal then went on a 2-0 run to take the lead for the first time in the game. After a timeout called by the Gauchos, junior utility Miranda Schrader put it in the back of the net to tie the game up 2-2 before going into half time.</p>\n<p>In the third period, the Gauchos claimed the lead once again off of a foul transition. The game went back and forth as Cal evened the score at the 4:10 mark only to be answered by Martin’s backhand scoring play, putting the Gauchos in the lead 5-4.</p>\n<p>As the battle continued, UCSB was able to contain the Bears’ offense until the last seven seconds of regulation when Carrega tied the match sending it into overtime.</p>\n<p>The first period of overtime went on scoreless, and it wasn’t until the 1:31 mark of the second period when the Bears found the winning goal by junior driver Genevieive Weed.</p>\n<p>On the second day of the tournament, the Gauchos played Cal Baptist in the afternoon with junior utility Taylor Shore, senior attacker Bryn Hudson and Martin each scoring two goals each.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense remained strong as it held off the Lancers, keeping them scoreless until midway of the second quarter, which by that point the Gauchos were already up 5-0. At the 4:42 mark Cal Baptist scored its first goal of the match, but was quickly answered by freshman utility Sarah Kreiser to maintain the five-point lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Lancers scored two more in the fourth quarter to shorten the lead 9-4, the Gauchos put one more away to end the game in a 10-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Later that night, UCSB faced its toughest competitor of the tournament, the UCLA Bruins. Despite having scored first, the Gauchos were not able to maintain its lead as the Bruins went on a 5-0 unanswered scoring streak.</p>\n<p>“I think we are countering well and we got good patience, something to improve on is reacting quicker on defense,” Kay said postgame.</p>\n<p>The first quarter ended with UCLA on top 3-1, which carried its momentum into the second quarter scoring within the period’s first minute. Although the Gauchos had the opportunity to strike back, they did not capitalize on the two back-to-back offensive fouls committed by the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Following the second period, the Gauchos managed to score two more goals, reducing their deficit to 6-3 to which the Bruins reacted quickly.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s efforts to catch up, UCLA did not give up the three-point lead ending the game 8-5 with a victory for the Bruins.</p>\n<p>“It is always fun to play against UCLA for me, those were my glory days and it is always a blast,” Kay said after facing her alma mater.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos wrapped up its Winter Invitational with a sweep over No.21 UCSD and No.20 Wagner.</p>\n<p>The Tritons were looking to finish the weekend with a perfect record in the first game of the day. However, after an intense seesaw game the Gauchos spoiled it for UCSD finishing on top 10-9.</p>\n<p>Both teams came out slow in the first quarter, and couldn’t seem to find the net. The Tritons opened up the board with a goal at the 5:26 mark to which the Gauchos counter attacked and scored a point to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Things got going in the second quarter as both teams scored a couple of goals, finishing the first half of the game with UCSB leading 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was an exciting fourth quarter in which the Tritons would fight back and tie the game on three separate occasions. Two of these were penalty shots from Alexia Wieseler.</p>\n<p>Unable to surpass a one-point lead, UCSB was aware of the importance to keep possession of the ball for as long as it could. After Schrader tallied a goal, the Gauchos held on to the ball and let the clock run to end the game with a close win over the Tritons.</p>\n<p>Despite a long weekend, the Gauchos remained focused and strong in their last game against Wagner. Great work on both ends of the pool helped defeat the Seahawks, 10-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not lose any time and put away two scores within the first minute and a half. The biggest lead came in the third quarter as the Gauchos held Wagner down 7-2.<br>\nAfter that, the Gauchos did not allow the Seahawks to get closer than three points.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a season-high of 15 saves during the game while Shore ended the day as UCSB’s leading scorer with five goals. Martin had six ejections total and three steals to contribute to the Gauchos’ total of 15.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with the team’s performance,” Kay said. “I really think we are playing with the best, but we still have a lot of areas to polish up, like technical skills and simple awareness.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their season on the road, as they head to Ann Arbor for the Michigan Invitational this upcoming weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/","id":5011,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5010,5009,5008],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon","biography":"Not available","articles":[1970,4969,4970,4971,4987,4989,4994,4997,5007,5010,5011,5012,5014,5453,5454,5455,5457,5458,5459,5471,5477],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Men’s Volleyball Drops Second-Straight to Bruins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-30-at-1.28.13-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-30-at-1.28.13-PM.png?resize=799%2C439&ssl=1","description":"Depsite having the home court advantage in both matches, the UCSB men's volleyball team lost its second-straight match to the UCLA Bruins.

Ultimately, however, that similarity extended to the result of the set, which the Bruins, now 8-1 overall and 6-0 in league, won 25-20 thanks to a four point run to close it out.</p>\n<p>Star outside hitter Jacob Delson was the only Gaucho on Wednesday to break double digits in kills with 13, while setter Casey McGarry put up 21 assists on the night. UCLA also only had one player in double digit kills – Jake Arnitz with 10 – but that was more a reflection of the Bruins’ well-roundedness than it was of any offensive struggles.</p>\n<p>On Friday, things were much the same for the Gauchos statistically. Delson just barely cracked the double-digit mark with 11 kills, and Corey Cheevers finished close behind with eight. The assists were different, as it was freshman setter Randy DeWeese who led the team with 26.</p>\n<p>It seemed initially that UCSB might have learned from their Westwood thrashing on Wednesday. The Gauchos led early and held that lead into the middle of the first set, stretching their advantage to a comfortable 17-13 spread at one point.</p>\n<p>UCLA responded to that challenge just like the second-ranked team in the nation should, ripping off a 12-5 run to take the lead and close out the set.</p>\n<p>A Keenan Sanders kill opened up the second set, and put the Gauchos up, but that was the only lead UCSB would hold in the second act. The two teams battled back and forth throughout the entire set, with UCLA’s 13-9 lead being the largest differential for either team. In the end, the Gauchos were unable to turn the tide back against the Bruins, who racked up two straight kills to squeak out a 25-22 win.</p>\n<p>Coming on the heels of the back-and-forth, tensely fought first two sets, the third set was a bit of a snoozefest. UCLA flew out of the gate with a four-point run to start and went up 7-1 in short order.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos clawed back into contention with a four-point run of their own to make it 7-5, but by the middle of the set the Bruins had things firmly under control.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a week off until its next game against Hawaii in Honolulu. The match is scheduled to take place at 9 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75308\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75308\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/mens-volleyball-drops-second-straight-to-bruins/","id":5008,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5007,5006,5005],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hopes To Bounce Back at Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.27_StephenManga_MensVB-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.27_StephenManga_MensVB-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Looking to rebound from two straight 3-0 losses to UCLA, the UCSB men’s volleyball team could probably use a change of scenery.

The senior setter leads the team in assists with 265 and is 16<sup>th</sup> in the nation with 9.46 assists per set, but it’s been sophomore Joe Worsley who’s handled the bulk of the assists in the past two games. That reshuffle is likely due to Hawaii head coach Charlie Wade’s lineup tinkering against Grand View, so it’s unclear if Worsley will continue as the primary setter even in league play.</p>\n<p>That reshuffle is likely due to Hawaii head coach Charlie Wade’s lineup tinkering against Grand View, so it’s unclear if Worsley will continue as the primary setter even in league play.</p>\n<p>There’s more to Hawaii’s success this season than just attack prowess, however. The Rainbow Warriors are among the best in the NCAA in both blocks and digs, with a sixth-best 2.53 block per set rate, and a ninth-best 8.89 dig rate. Success in those two areas has allowed Hawaii to hold its opponents to a microscopic .216 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are going to have to work hard to get past that defense if they want to rebound from last week’s setbacks and really enjoy their trip to beautiful Honolulu. As of late, however, UCSB has struggled with its hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>While still ranked seventh in that category, the Gauchos hit at a .235 rate in their two games against UCLA. Against a team with a defense like the Rainbow Warriors’ UCSB is going to have to hit better than that to win.</p>\n<p>Key to that effort will be finding another player to help relieve some of Jacob Delson’s offensive burden. Against UCLA, Delson was the only Gaucho to record double-digit kills in either game. In Honolulu, UCSB will need players like Corey Chavers and Keenan Sanders to step up and give the Gaucho attack a more balanced approach.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Hawaii at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu on Friday night at 9:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75489\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75489\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-at-hawaii/","id":5009,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5008,5007,5006],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Host Nation’s Top Teams in Winter Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-7-2015_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-7-2015_9-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"A total of 11 Top-25 teams will participate in the UCSB Winter Invitational, starting Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67481\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67481\" data-attachment-id=\"67481\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/camila-schafer-passes-the-ball-to-a-teammate-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-7-2015_9-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Camila Schafer passes the ball to a teammate.

During her time there, she helped the Vaqueros reach the Western State Conference championship and the quarterfinals of the So Cal Regional, in which they held an 8-1 record. In her coaching career she has worked with athletes like four-time Olympian Terry Shroeder, USA goalkeeper Merrill Moses as well as US Men’s National Water Polo team captain Tony Azevedo.</p>\n<p>After a close 10-9 overtime win over Long Beach State, the Gauchos finished in fifth-place at the Big West Conference Tournament last year. In 2016, UCSB will try to improve its 3-4 conference play record with the help of returning players like Mackenzie Brokaw, Murphy and young talent like freshman utility Sarah Kreiser.</p>\n<p>Now a senior goalkeeper, Brokaw had an outstanding last year as she finished the season with a total of 161 saves and a season-high of 13 goals against UC Irvine. Her 5.04 goals against average ranks first all-time, as it was a new Big West single-season record.</p>\n<p>As for Murphy, who scored 34 goals and had 24 assists in 30 games, she also received Honorable Mention-All American recognition by the ACWPC for the second time in three years. She currently ranks fifth in Gaucho history with 129 goals.</p>\n<p>Along with its veteran players, it can be expected that UCSB will showcase its young talent throughout the season. Much attention will be provided to the performance of freshman utility Kreiser, who was named First Team All-CIF and earned her third consecutive First Team All-Sea View League award while at Trabuco Hills High School.  Kreiser led her high school team with 100 goals and 101 steals her senior year, including a season-high 10 steals in two games. She was named Female Athlete of the Year by her former school, which was based on both her athletic and academic achievements.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host Cal to begin its season this Friday at 2:10 p.m. at Campus Pool. The Gauchos are set to face Cal Baptist and UCLA in a doubleheader on Saturday, facing the Lancers first at 12:30 p.m. then the Bruins at 6 p.m. at the Rec Cen. Santa Barbara will close out its weekend with two final matches versus No. 21 UC San Diego at 12:10 p.m. and No. 20 Wagner at 4:20 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/","id":5010,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5009,5008,5007],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
