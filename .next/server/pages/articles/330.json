The Gauchos end their year with an overall record of 18-13 and 11-5 in the Big West. The Rainbow Warriors improved to 26-5, advancing to the Big West Championship where they will face third seeded Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>It was a quick start for Hawaii, grabbing the lead early behind the play of center Stefan Jankovic. The newly crowned Big West Player of the Year connected on four of his first five shots, including two early threes, which handed Hawaii a 14-9 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Mizzou-transfer finished with 24 in points and seven rebounds in 31 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Warriors managed to extend their lead to 10 points as senior Aaron Valdez scored six straight points starting with a dunk assisted by forward Sai Tummala with 8:47 to go in the first. The third-year guard tallied his third double-double of the season finishing with 19 points and ten boards. This was also Valdez’s third straight game with 18 points or more.</p>\n<p>Following a 27-17 outpour by Hawaii, Santa Barbara responded with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>Guard Gabe Vincent helped turn things around scoring seven points in the final four minutes of the first period. The sophomore answered a Jankovich three with a make form beyond the arc, helping trim UCSB’s deficit to one at 30-29.</p>\n<p>Vincent then took a strong drive to the rim and gave the Gauchos their first lead since the 15 minute mark of the game at 31-30. The Stockton, CA native shot 46.7 percent from the floor for 17 points. Santa Barbara finished 9-2 in conference play when Vincent shoots above 40 percent, both losses coming to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>While UCSB only trailed by three heading into the break, the Gauchos were unable to halt Hawaii’s 21-3 run ignited by senior guard Roderick Bobbitt.</p>\n<p>Connecting on three straight three-pointers to open up the second half, Bobbitt scored 12 of his total 21 points in the final 20 minutes of play helping Hawaii maintain its lead. The Oakland point guard contributed distributing the ball as well tallying four of his five assists in the second period and grabbing at total of six rebounds.</p>\n<p>A big margin of difference lied in Hawaii’s field goal percentage and trips to the line. The Warriors shot 52 percent from the floor as well as hitting 27-37 free throws. Santa Barbara, a team who has shown consistency at the line, finished 16-27 from the free throw line. The Gauchos also took 10 more shots than Hawaii, going 26-60 from the floor, but finished with 43.3 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Alex Hart gave a much needed boost off the bench for UCSB. The sophomore forward finished with a career-high 13 points, shooting a perfect 3-3 from three-point range. Eric Childress also played a role on the defensive end. The junior guard finished with a career-high six steals, four of which came in the first half including three-straight steals with six minutes to go.</p>\n<p>However, the efforts of both players would not be enough to prevent the Rainbow Warriors from securing their 88-76 victory. Hawaii will attempt to win the conference championship in hopes of earning its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2002.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/","id":330,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[329,328,327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 5 Seeded Gauchos to Face No. 8 Seeded UCI in First Round of BW Tourney Tuesday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WBBall_SpencerBrandt-for03062016-IMG_5700-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a 2-27, 2-14 conference finish last season, the UCSB women's basketball team will make its return to the Big West Conference Tournament as the No. 5 seed set to face No. 8 seeded UC Irvine this ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Tuesday marks the beginning of the 2015-16 Big West Conference Women’s Basketball Tournament.

The Gauchos last won the conference tournament during their 2012-13 run, in which they made history as the lowest seed (sixth) in Big West history to win the championship.</p>\n<p>Due to splitting its regular season series with Cal State Fullerton, who also finished with a 1-15 conference record, it was by virtue of winning a coin flip that UC Irvine clinched the eighth seed.</p>\n<p>Despite ending the season with a 4-26 overall and 1-15 conference record, the Anteaters may be able to capitalize on their home advantage. But, this home advantage isn’t a guaranteed benefit for UCI after finishing with a 2-11 home record and ending the season on a 10 game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, contributing to its losing slump were two losses to UCSB as the Gauchos achieved a season sweep of the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In two meetings this season, Santa Barbara defeated UCI by a combined point differential of 23.5 points.</p>\n<p>For the most part of this season, losses by a double-figure margin has been the tale for the Anteaters. They’ve managed to lose by a single-figure differential just three times this season and even allowed 126 points in a loss to Sacramento State in December.</p>\n<p>While statistics prove that UCI isn’t a great offensive team, shooting around 34 percent in both overall and conference play, UCSB’s defense has done an exceptional job all season long, especially against UCI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished third in the Big West in points allowed per game with a 63.1 average. Their stout defense improved in conference play as well, finishing second in the rankings allowing 61.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>In spite of allowing a 40.4 field goal percentage in the first meeting, Santa Barbara forced 22 turnovers in the game and outscored the Anteaters 31-13 in points off turnovers to go along with 11 steals. The Gauchos continued their defensive dominance in their second matchup against UCI, limiting the Anteaters to a field goal percentage of 31 percent (18-58 shooting) and 14.3 percent from behind the three-point line. They held UCI to four points in the second and fourth quarters in the same contest.</p>\n<p>Still, just like any team in the country this postseason, UCSB cannot underestimate the Anteaters’ potential to pull off an upset Tuesday night. After making the decision to forgo her senior season, junior forward Mokun Fajemisin will be looking to make an impact in what could be her final game.</p>\n<p>UCI’s leading scorer and rebounder with 9.5 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, Fajemisin also leads the Big West in blocks per game with a 2.0 per game. She is coming off 16 points, nine rebounds, and two blocks in the team’s 76-70 loss to UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will also face the Big West’s top playmaker in senior guard Raelyn Cheung-Sutton. She led the Big West in assists per game with 5.7. Cheung-Sutton remained consistent in conference play, averaging 5.5 helpers per contest. She enters Tuesday after registering a season-high 17 points and tying her career-high total of 12 assists in the loss to UCD.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s backcourt will deal with the task of containing Cheung-Sutton’s vision on the court, an improvement in play by sophomore guard Makala Roper is essential if the Gauchos plan on making a run this postseason.</p>\n<p>After starting in just six games her freshman season and averaging 6.5 ppg, Roper emerged as UCSB’s top scorer in her second year leading the Gauchos in scoring with 11.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>Enhancing her increase in scoring was her range from beyond the arc. During the regular season, Roper ranked fourth in the Big West in three-point percentage at 38.7 percent.</p>\n<p>However, as the Gauchos enter Tuesday 1-3 in their last four games, Roper has struggled during this span as well. She scored 10 points once during this stretch of games along with registering just two points in 19 minutes of play in the team’s final game at Hawaii last Thursday.</p>\n<p>But Roper’s ability to embrace the role placed upon her this season did not go unnoticed as she earned All-Big West Honorable Mention honors on Monday. Senior Jasmine Ware also was named to the Honorable Mention team while freshman guard Coco Miller was selected to the All-Freshman Team.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Conference Tournament is set to tip-off at 6 p.m. this Tuesday, March 8 at the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/","id":327,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[326,325,324],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Advance, Face No. 4 Seed UC Davis Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A 62-43 first round victory over UC Irvine Tuesday night handed the UCSB women's basketball team its first postseaosn victory since the 2012-13 season.

Staying active for Irvine in the opening period was junior forward Mckenzie Piper with four of her eight points and five of her eight rebounds occurring during the period.</p>\n<p>However, Irvine was held scoreless for the remaining 5:37 of first quarter as UCSB went on a 5-0 run to close out the quarter with a tied score of 12-12.</p>\n<p>Neither team could score a basket to begin the second quarter with the first point of the period being at the 6:49 mark from a made free-throw by UCSB freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Newton managed to provide some offense in the paint with six points in the quarter but was matched in points by UCI junior guard Irene Chavez. The Anteaters’ leading scorer with 11 points, Chavez scored six of Irvine’s 10 points in the quarter but could not prevent UCSB from entering halftime with a 25-22 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes and two ties occurred during the third quarter. Tied 34-34, a layup by sophomore guard Makala Roper handed UCSB a 36-34 lead heading into the game’s final period.</p>\n<p>While the Anteaters recorded their best shooting percentage of 38.5 percent in the third quarter, they faltered in the fourth with a 15.8 field goal percentage to end the game.</p>\n<p>As UCI was plagued by its shooting woes, UCSB registered its best shooting performance of the game with a 52.6 shooting percentage in the final quarter. At the helm of the Gauchos’ late surge was Ware with 10 points to help lead UCSB to its 62-43 victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to punch its ticket to Anaheim tonight with a matchup against No. 4 seeded UC Davis at 8:30 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Sophomore guard Makala Roper led UCSB in scoring with 20 points on 7-18 shooting overall and 3-8 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UC Davis advances to the Semifinals and will face Big West Conference regular season champion UC Riverside this Friday at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos recorded a season-low nine turnovers and matched Davis in field goals made at 24, their 11 extra shot attempts did not benefit them as their 38.7 field goal percentage was surpassed by the Aggies’ 47.1 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>In her postseason debut, redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch led the Aggies’ efficient shooting with a career-high 26 points on 11-16 shooting, tying her career best in field goals made. Her career-high in scoring is the most in a Big West Tournament game by a UC Davis player.</p>\n<p>Bertsch’s career night started early as she scored five points in the Aggies’ 11-4 run to open the game, forcing UCSB to call a timeout. She went on to finish the quarter with nine points while shooting a perfect 4-4 from the field.</p>\n<p>Unable to contain the Aggies’ offense, UCSB’s issues continued on the offensive end as well. Able to only score in spurts, the Gauchos concluded the period down 10-20 after a 4-16 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Despite its shooting woes to begin the game, Santa Barbara improved in the second quarter shooting 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from behind the three-point line, and 100 percent at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>An 8-3 scoring run to begin the second period helped UCSB to trim Davis’ lead to five at 18-23. But the Aggies regained their double figure lead after a made three-pointer by sophomore forward Pele Gianotti. Finishing tied with senior forward Celia Marfone for second in scoring at 15 points apiece, Gianotti went 4-9 shooting the ball and was 2-5 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Trailing by 12, Santa Barbara prevented Davis from extending its lead with an 8-2 run prior to entering halftime. Back-to-back three-pointers by senior guard Dioseline Lopez and Roper in the remaining 2:09 of the second quarter cut the Aggies’ lead to 34-28. Topping off the Gauchos’ run was sophomore forward Taylor Farris with a layup as UCSB entered the half trailing 30-36.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second half, Santa Barbara extended its scoring stretch to a 14-5 run.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ offensive charge in the third quarter was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and freshman guard Coco Miller with a combined total of 13 points on 4-5 shooting.</p>\n<p>With its lead only at three, UC Davis responded with a 7-0 run of its own to recapture another 10-point lead at 46-36 to force a Gauchos’ timeout.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB answered with a 13-4 run to close out the third quarter, capturing its first lead of the game at 49-48 after a made free-throw by Jemerigbe. But the Gauchos’ lead would only last for six seconds as Davis’ sophomore guard Rachel Nagel made a jumpshot to give the Aggies a 50-49 lead before starting the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>While it was a strong ending for UCSB in the game’s final period, shooting 46.7 percent from the field in addition to eight points by Roper, Davis’ scoring arsenal of Bertsch, Gianotti, and Marfone was nearly unguardable.</p>\n<p>The trio scored 19 of the Aggies’ 21 points in the quarter, shot 7-10 from the field, and 2-2 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>A total of seven lead changes occurred in the final 10 minutes of Wednesday’s game. With 1:50 remaining in regulation, a three-pointer by Marfone increased the Aggies’ lead to four to 68-64.</p>\n<p>After calling a timeout, the Gauchos’ top three-pointer shooter in Roper responded with a clutch three of her own to reduce UC Davis’ lead to 68-67.</p>\n<p>Similar to Santa Barbara putting the ball into the hands of its best player, the Aggies did the same in getting the ball to Bertsch in the paint.</p>\n<p>In spite of the play call not succeeding and UCSB gaining possession, UC Davis’ defense managed to hold its ground forcing a turnover with the shot-clock violation to lead itself to victory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/","id":329,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[328,327,326],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
