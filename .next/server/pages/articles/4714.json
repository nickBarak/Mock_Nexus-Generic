","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 19 UCSB baseball team has hit a rough stretch at the most inopportune time of the season. With only three Big West series remaining, the Gauchos will need to win this weekend at home against UC Riverside to strengthen their playoff chances.</p>\n<p>“We have to win the rest of our series,” junior second baseman Woody Woodward said. “We just need to score more runs than the other team. It sounds simple, but we have to hit when we don’t pitch and pitch when we don’t hit.”</p>\n<p>UCSB limps home with some serious battle scars after last weekend’s tough series against Long Beach State. The Gauchos ended up on the wrong side of one-run games twice against LBSU before winning the series finale. Standing 24-10 overall and 5-7 in the Big West conference, Santa Barbara is in fifth place in the standings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I don’t think there’s any pressure because we know we’re a good team,” Woodward said. “And we know that we can go places. We have to take it one game at a time and get better every day.”</p>\n<p>UCR has been the conference’s biggest overachievers so far. Climbing their way to almost .500, the Highlanders are 17-19 overall and 6-3 in league after sweeping UC Davis in their last conference series. Riverside sits alone in third place, two games out of the second spot.</p>\n<p>With just two conference road wins under its belt, Santa Barbara welcomes a return to Caesar Uyesaka Stadium where it is 15-4 this year. Meanwhile, the road has been a headache for UCR. Riverside is 4-12 outside of home and has lost eight of its last nine away games. UCSB will have to take advantage of the home field given this is the second to last conference home series on the year.</p>\n<p>Senior Jake Smigelski will take the mound in game one for the Highlanders. In his last start against UC Davis, Smigelski threw 100 pitches in five laboring innings of work to improve to 5-4 on the season. For UCSB, sophomore Justin Jacome will be called on to contain the UCR offense that ranks third in hitting.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Pettibone is slated to take the mound for the Gauchos in game two, followed by freshman Shane Bieber in game three. Bieber is coming off his best start of the season last weekend when he tossed eight innings and gave up just one run en route to striking out eight batters.</p>\n<p>After leading the nation in hitting last week, senior third baseman Joey Epperson now finds himself in an unexpected hitting slump. Epperson has gone 1-12 in the past three games to lower his batting average to .418, a drop from his previous clip of .441. Nevertheless, the senior still leads the Big West in batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>Epperson and junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa have provided the one-two punch on offense for the Gauchos. Kuresa leads the team with 33 RBIs, and his .574 slugging percentage and eight homeruns are second-best in league. He was one of the few productive bats in the lineup last weekend as he hit .400 in the series.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sophomore Dillon Tate has served as the shutdown closer this year with nine saves.</p>\n<p>Tate has been lights-out in his 21.2 innings of work. He has given up just one earned run on the season and has struck out 28 batters, well above one strikeout per inning. After last weekend’s shutout outing, Tate lowered his ERA to 0.83.</p>\n<p>“In that closer role he just pounds the zone and every team is going to have a really tough time hitting him,” Woodward said.</p>\n<p>First pitch for Friday’s game is scheduled for 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 24’s print edition of the Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/no-19-gauchos-enter-must-win-series/","id":4714,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4713,4712,4711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 14 UCSB Hits the Road to Face Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will look to continue its strong play against Long Beach State after winning last week's series against Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off three wins in its past four games, the No. 14 UCSB baseball team eyes its first conference series win on the road starting tonight against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game 23-8 overall and 4-5 in the Big West after Monday’s nonconference victory against BYU.

Hopefully the way we’ve been playing continues to reward us this weekend at Long Beach.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach State presents a different challenge for Santa Barbara. The Dirtbags have won three of their last seven series and enter 16-18 overall and 3-3 in league.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s winning formula has been pitching and defense. Senior pitcher Josh Frye has been the ace of the staff and pitches the second game of the series. The right-hander has started the last three weeks and the team has gone 3-0 in each of his appearances. Frye has been nearly unhittable, allowing just a run in his last 16 innings and five hits combined during his last two starts.</p>\n<p>Just as unhittable has been junior closer Kyle Friedrichs. In six save opportunities, the closer has converted all of them without giving up a run or walk, with just two hits. Opposing batters are hitting a mere .105 against him.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s efficiency on defense is shown in its .980 fielding percentage, the eighth highest in the country. In total, the Dirtbags have committed just 27 errors this season.</p>\n<p>Although not as reputable as Cal State Fullerton, UCSB learned how tough the Big West is earlier in the season when it lost its series against Hawaii University and will be careful not to repeat its mistake.</p>\n<p>“When you have a good year, you have a target on your back,” Epperson said. “I wouldn’t expect Long Beach to be any different. We’re preparing just like we prepared for Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have consistently been able to put up runs on the scoreboard. Statistically, Santa Barbara is top in the league in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and homeruns.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s offensive statistics are a testament to the team’s potent lineup, no hitter in the country this year has been seeing the ball as clear as Epperson.</p>\n<p>Epperson leads the nation with a .451 batting average and his numbers have been recognized with him being added to the Midseason “Golden Spikes Award” Watch List — the award given to the top amateur player in the country. His most underrated aspect, however, has been his versatility to hit anywhere in the batting order, from leadoff to the cleanup spot.</p>\n<p>“There’s really not a lot of pressure on each individual offensively, and I certainly feel that way,” Epperson said. “I’m really comfortable on the leadoff spot and I’ll hit wherever, and I kind of feel like I’m just going to go for it and do whatever I can to help the team win.”</p>\n<p>Just as dominant as Epperson, has been the UCSB bullpen. When leading after six innings, Santa Barbara is 17-0 with much of the credit going to sophomore closer Dillon Tate and his eight saves on the season, second overall in conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send sophomore Justin Jacome and junior Austin Pettibone for games one and two, respectively. Saturday’s starter is yet to be announced.</p>\n<p>First pitch tonight is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54887\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54887\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/","id":4711,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4710,4709,4708],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 UCSB Takes Series Against Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 13 Gauchos won the series against the No. 19 Titans 2-1.

Both kept batters off balance by throwing breaking pitches, with Mazza’s curveball helping him get through 5.2 innings of relief and not allowing a run. The left-hander improved to 3-2 on the season after coming in for freshman starter Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to pick up my teammate, Bieber. He struggled a little bit, but he kept them to only two runs,” Mazza said. “I just wanted to come in and keep them where they were at, basically limit the inning and pound the zone.”</p>\n<p>With a new pitcher for Fullerton on the mound in the ninth, junior outfielder Cameron Newell singled up the middle on the first pitch of the inning to put a runner on first base. After a sacrifice bunt advanced the runner, the nation’s leading hitter, Epperson, connected on a fastball for his second walk-off hit against a ranked opponent in his career.</p>\n<p>“I thought they were just going to put me on, but when they didn’t, I figured they were pitching around me,” Epperson said. “I was trusting that Newell’s got good legs out there, and I was just trying to put a good swing on a ball, and not do too much.”</p>\n<p>Game one foreshadowed the closeness of the two teams. What was thought to be a low-scoring game turned out to be anything but as each team knocked around each side’s best pitcher early on.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ pitcher Thomas Eshelman came in with a 1.43 ERA and 5-1 record, but the Gauchos roughed him up for six earned runs, the most given up in his career. UCSB’s ace, junior Austin Pettibone did not fare better, lasting just three innings before exiting.</p>\n<p>The game was tied 9-9 in the tenth before darkness forced the match to be rescheduled before the start of game two. CSUF came out on top when play resumed by sneaking in two runs in the 11th inning for the hard fought 11-9 win.</p>\n<p>“You end in a tie to be resumed the next day and there’s a little bit of a letdown,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately they put a couple good swings together in that first half and we went down 2-0 right away. It was tough because I thought the day before I kind of felt if we grinded that out, it would’ve gone our way.”</p>\n<p>UCSB takes a break from conference play for today’s match against BYU. The Cougars are 14-23 overall on the season and 5-10 in the West Coast Conference after losing two games in its series against Pepperdine University.</p>\n<p>Brigham Young will rely on its three best hitters in junior third baseman Dillon Robinson, senior infielder Brock Whitney and freshman outfielder Brennon Lund. Each is hitting above .300 and will cause problems for UCSB pitching.</p>\n<p>First pitch is scheduled for 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54823\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54823\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/","id":4712,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4711,4710,4709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Series to Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB dropped two of three games in this past weekend's series at Long Beach State.

Bieber tossed eight innings of four-hit ball and struck out eight batters to limit the Dirtbags to just one run.</p>\n<p>“That was the best I’ve ever seen [Bieber],” junior pitcher Austin Pettibone said. “He was kind of in the zone with his fastball. His slider was pretty filthy. That’s all you want to do — to be able to get deep into the game.”</p>\n<p>His outing set the stage for sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate to collect his ninth save of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game’s deadlock on a RBI groundout by sophomore utility player Robby Nesovic in the third inning to go up 1-0. Santa Barbara manufactured another run in the following inning on a fly out, after a sacrifice bunt advanced a runner to third base.</p>\n<p>Much of the game from there on consisted of each team’s pitching retiring the others’ bats. Bieber’s lone blemish came in the fifth inning when he allowed a runner to score on a fielder’s choice.</p>\n<p>Bieber was near perfect on the day, needing only 93 pitches for the win and lowering his ERA to 2.89.</p>\n<p>Bieber’s outing came the day before when Long Beach’s senior pitcher Josh Frye shutout the Gauchos in a tight 1-0 decision. Frye canceled out Pettibone’s own impressive efforts. The two starters were locked in a pitcher’s duel with Pettibone exiting after six innings with one run allowed.</p>\n<p>After Long Beach capitalized on two hits in the first inning to score the game’s only run, Pettibone seemed in for a long outing similar to his last start, but the right-hander settled down from there on.</p>\n<p>“It felt good to throw well again; I’ve been struggling these past couple weeks against Cal Poly and Fullerton,” Pettibone said. “I gave up an earned run which ended up hurting us, but overall I had a competitive outing.”</p>\n<p>Frye went the distance to improve to 3-0 on the season. Long Beach has now won Frye’s last four starts as the senior has given up only one run in his last 27 innings thrown.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s only threat came by way of junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who was the only Gaucho to get past first base.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s five-run game was the highest scoring game of the series. Mounting a two-run rally in the ninth, the Gauchos’ comeback attempt fell short in the bottom half of the inning on a walk-off hit by the Dirtbags.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s sophomore pitcher Andrew Rohrbach kept hitters guessing for eight innings and did not rattle until the ninth. Kuresa doubled to force a change, and junior Kyle Friedrichs came in for the save.</p>\n<p>Friedrichs, however, gave up a walk and was victim to an infield error that brought in the runner from second. Freshman DH Billy Fredrick then stepped up to the plate and delivered the game-tying hit to nod the score at 2-2 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Long Beach got the bottom half of the inning started with a single off junior Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has been a workhorse and reliable relief pitcher for the Gauchos, retired the next batter before giving up the game-winning double for the 3-2 loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts UCR beginning Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of </em><em>April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/","id":4713,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4712,4711,4710],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
