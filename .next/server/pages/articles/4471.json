Headshots were discouraged, but not prohibited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplicity allowed several bystanders to immediately join in and participate in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just fun. If anyone else could come out here, be silly, hit each other with foam swords and get a pretty good workout … it’s pretty good,” Fraczek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanning over two hours, the warriors alternated among games of shirts versus skins, king of the hill, capture the flag and one-versus-one. Several warriors flung their arms around and slowly fell after being hit by a finishing blow, emphasizing the worthiness of their defeat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunter McCoole, a communication major currently taking a hiatus from school, was walking her dog when she saw the warriors fighting outside her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looks like it was played safe. Everyone looked super stoked, and I think it’s great that everyone came outdoors and just had fun instead of being inside and studying,” McCoole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 30 minutes of the LARP, Police Officer Andy Radujko stopped by on his motorcycle and took out his baton, jokingly ready to battle with the rest of the warriors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radujko used to engage in a similar activity during high school and said it was great that Excursion Club was hosting the event. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75725\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75725\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/","id":4471,"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong"},"related":[4470,4469,4468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong","biography":"Not available","articles":[2722,2740,4413,4441,4471],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Vista Point: The Weekly Goings-On in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Valentines, anti-Valentines, free food, a capella for a good cause and more this week in I.V.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>SUCCULENTS<br>\nSanta Barbara Hillel will be hosting a Paint N’ Plant event to celebrate the Tu B’Shevat holiday.

Half of the funding will come from the public works department and the other half from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The project will begin in late summer, and the department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The county will determine a specific start date after removing pre-existing streetlight infrastructure at the intersection.</p>\n<p>Given the high traffic at the intersection, the construction will occur almost entirely on the sidewalk area. Some street shoulders are expected to be closed.</p>\n<p>The intersection has two stop signs for northbound and southbound traffic, giving eastbound and westbound traffic the right of way at all times.</p>\n<p>An increase in bike and car traffic over the years contributed to the change. Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, presented the project at an I.V. Community Network Meeting in January.</p>\n<p>“This project should provide a much more orderly and functional intersection, safely integrating bicycle, pedestrian and auto traffic,” George Thurlow, the university’s liaison for I.V. affairs, said.</p>\n<p>The original plan involved the installation of two traffic signals, one at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte and the other at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p>The county determined that only one signal was necessary with the hope that the signal on Embarcadero Del Norte will cause sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic at the Embarcadero Del Mar intersection.</p>\n<p>The county also proposed a four-way stop and a roundabout for this intersection, but officials concluded that neither would be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes coming through the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It really came down to a traffic signal,” McGolpin said. “It will allow the bikes that are coming out of the campus to see the red bulb and slow down a little bit and allow the signal to go through a 15–20-second cycle. It’s definitely going to be new for I.V.”</p>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board chair and a 35-year I.V. resident, said she has noticed cars and delivery trucks having difficulty crossing while students ride their bicycles during the busiest times of the day.</p>\n<p>“Safety is the biggest concern,” she said. “Whatever is put there, I hope people are paying attention and being careful.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant. The Santa Barbara County Public Works Department and UCSB provided funding. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75599\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75599\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/","id":4469,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[4468,4467,4466],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Surf Report: Feb. 10 to 12","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"When are the swells swell?

Knew you’d be back again for the inside on catching the insides this weekend. Now, because of the overwhelming demand on my surf expertise, I have decided to bless ya with yet another completely accurate compilation of my surf report. If y’all didn’t catch that last bit of sarcasm, I wish you the best with reading the rest of this and hope you know these are surf predictions, not something to bet your life on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, let’s move on to the nitty gritty.

It’s not the strongest surge, but it’s definitely causing some waves for us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let’s take a look at the three amigos, shall we?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday: best swells, worst weather; 4-6 feet, largest waves in the p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday: average swells, average weather; 3-5 feet, better surf in the a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday: eh swells, but great weather; 1-3 feet all day</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, before you go running off asking the paddle boarders for some wax (please don’t), let me warn you about the rain coming on Friday. Oftentimes, rain means bacterial runoff being really present in the water during and after first day of rain. I know your surfing urges plunge you into the water despite possible sickness, but please be careful. Take care of yourself for finals, okay? Don’t say I never warned the freshies.
