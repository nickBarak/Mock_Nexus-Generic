Courtesy of St. George</p></div>\n<p>Independent housing developer Ed St. George of St. George Associates introduced a proposal earlier this year to convert Beach City apartments on Cliff Drive into dorms for Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students.</p>\n<p>St. George plans to renovate the two-story apartments by adding a third story to accommodate up to 1,500 SBCC students. Existing kitchens will be removed for more space, and a new shared dining commons will be added. The proposal is currently in the second pre-application process under the City of Santa Barbara Planning Division.</p>\n<p>Planning Division Project Planner Daniel Gullett said the Santa Barbara Planning Commission will review the early concept of the project.</p>\n<p>“The applicant will be submitting another pre-application in January because there are so many large issues to address,” Gullett said. “The applicant will get more feedback from city staff and then put together a formal application.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the Planning Commission is taking special caution with the proposal because the project is a new concept for the city.</p>\n<p>“It’s a unique project for the city. We don’t have any dormitories, and this particular project requires a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission,” Gullett said. “So there is a lot of discretion in the review. It would be the only dormitory in the city.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the application process may take years to approve because the project is unique to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“City council would have to approve the zone change and land use designation change to allow for the height, and Coastal Commission would have to certify,” Gullett said. “The design would also have to be approved by the Architectural Board of Review.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Elledge Planning and Permitting Services Principal Planner Laurel Perez said the firm is currently developing the second pre-application package, which they will submit in early January.</p>\n<p>“We’ve engaged traffic and parking consultants, a project biologist and project archeologist that will look at the cultural resources that might be present on site,” Perez said. “We’re completing those technical studies that will help address many of the questions that the city has identified in relationship to this project.”</p>\n<p>According to Perez, the project is still in its early stages and will continue to address concerns such as parking issues, noise and neighborhood compatibility.</p>\n<p>“Ed St. George’s primary objective for this project is to create a student environment that positively interacts with the local community,” Perez said. “Hopefully together we can come up with a project that addresses community concerns and help to meet a long overdue student housing need.”</p>\n<p>Perez said many other community colleges in the nation are facing similar housing issues because of increasing enrollment.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to learn that this is not a unique situation that SBCC is facing,” Perez said. “We are seeing an increase in the number of students who are attending a community college that provide excellent education.”</p>\n<p>According to SBCC President Lori Gaskin, less than 15 of the 113 colleges in the California Community College system have dormitories.</p>\n<p>“Dormitories are not funded by the state for community colleges and are not part of the mission,” Gaskin said. “Those [community colleges with dorms] tend to be in locations that are very remote or are servicing remote geographic regions.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said Beach City Apartments are close to campus but unaffiliated with the college.</p>\n<p>“It existed for a long time, but this particular developer bought it a couple of years ago and is seeking to increase the capacity of living apartments,” Gaskin said.<br>\nGaskin said the proposal might help with low vacancy rates and high rental fees in Santa Barbara, which have impacted student enrollment rates at SBCC since 2009.</p>\n<p>“This fall semester we are down in enrollment by over four percent. When we reached out to potential students on why they applied but chose not to enroll, they talked about the cost of living,” Gaskin said. “The cost of living competes with the cost of going to school, so it’s really hard on our students.”</p>\n<p>SBCC student and third-year communication major Allie Trice said it was easy for her to find housing in Isla Vista because she had friends from UCSB living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I chose to live here because all of my friends lived here since they went to UCSB. I didn’t really have any friends at SBCC,” Trice said. “It was convenient. It was nice already knowing people living here.”</p>\n<p>Trice said housing in I.V. and the Santa Barbara area is expensive because of its proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“When I first moved down here, I was like, ‘Wow. I’m paying for living in a double as much as you’d pay for a whole apartment where I’m from,’” Trice said. “I understand that it’s expensive because we live right down the street from the beach.”</p>\n<p>Trice said the proposal would be a convenient option for SBCC students struggling to find affordable housing near campus.</p>\n<p>“I would never personally do it because I like living [in I.V.],” Trice said. “But I know that would be a really good option for many students, because I know that at city college, there is a struggle to get housing there, and it’s expensive as well.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66624\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66624\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/","id":4609,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[4608,4607,4606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga","biography":"Not available","articles":[2578,2579,2586,2593,2645,2675,3603,3854,4609,4636],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Local Residents and Students Meet To Discuss a Parking Permit Program in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Long-term residents Maia, Jay Freeman and Bob Sumner hosted a meeting to discuss the possibility of a future parking permit program in Isla Vista at the I.V.

Clinic Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed the parking permit program, funded by the county or potential Community Services District, and voiced concerns and requests regarding its implementation. A record of the discussion was kept to one day present overall findings to various governing bodies. Upcoming meetings will discuss the permit exclusivity for I.V. residents, showing proof of residency for permits and UCSB’s responsibility in addressing the issue. The next parking permit meeting will be held on Sunday, Nov. 22 at 4 p.m. in the I.V. Clinic Building.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Bruce Murdock said he estimates around 30 to 40 percent of people who park in Isla Vista are students and faculty using the town as alternative campus parking.</p>\n<p>“The number of people that go to UCSB, both faculty and students, don’t want to pay the fees to park on campus so they come and park in Isla Vista,” Murdock said. “They are people that are from the outside and parked there so they can go to the campus.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car. How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?<br>\n<em>– I.V. resident Bruce Murdock</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I.V. resident Peter Neushul said the amount of parking in I.V. does not coincide with its resident population.</p>\n<p>“The new towers and new villages going up are going to have staff and those staff are going to want to park for free in our town,” Neushul said. “So it has to be looked upon as it is something that is just going to get worse and something that now encircles the entire Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the demand for street parking will decrease if property owners lower in-unit parking fees.</p>\n<p>“If we could make it so that the landlords that are providing parking weren’t charging extra for parking … that would lessen some of the load on the on-street parking,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said landlords cannot alleviate the issue by lowering fees because there are not enough parking spaces on the properties.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got an apartment that has 30 students and you have 10 parking places you can pass all the laws you want and write all the reports you want, you’ve still only got 10 parking spaces,” Murdock said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66502\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66502\" data-attachment-id=\"66502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/parking_by-vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447611919\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Parking Commission Meeting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66502\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1-250x166.jpg?resize=350%2C232\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-66502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Murdock also said many I.V. residents who have access to parking garages fail to use them.</p>\n<p>“Its purpose is to park a car, now how many of the garages that are affiliated with apartments and or houses do they park cars in? Not many,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said future permit plans should reference previous I.V. parking regulation attempts, such as the Isla Vista Master Plan parking management program of 2004 which was denied by the Coastal Commission.</p>\n<p>“Coastal Commission’s main priority is to protect access of the public to the coast … that access points can be parked in at reasonable fees so that the beaches of California remain accessible to everybody,” Freeman said. “They end up in a strange position when communities like us come to them with parking programs.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB should discourage first-year students from bringing their cars to Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“If the University provided that as a really strong statement in their introductory material to send to their parents, then the parents would have a strong influence on their children, saying ‘well the University really doesn’t want you to have a car there,’” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said freshman students have a “right” to car ownership.</p>\n<p>“I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car,” Murdock said. “How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB will not voluntarily alleviate the I.V. parking problem without incentive.</p>\n<p>“We need to be thinking about how to exert leverage outside the University in order to get them to do things we might want them to do,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Hammond said a mobile home site for students living in trailers could be an alternative parking solution.</p>\n<p>“A better solution might be to try and build some sort of trailer park somewhere for people who live in trailers or in their cars to park safely,” Hammond said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said instead of I.V. parking officers determining whether cars are parked for more than 72 hours by chalking tires, officers could implement a pay-by-plate program.</p>\n<p>“You have an SUV drive through I.V. and as it drives through I.V., it is scanning all the license plates that are along the side of the road and determining what cars are in what positions,” Freeman said. “And then if you want to buy a permit you don’t have to decide on a parking spot, you aren’t tied to a spot, you can just pay by tying your license plate into either a kiosk or a website or over the phone. That means that we can have visitor parking to be essentially any spot we want in I.V.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

believe noise, drugs and alcohol are problems in Isla Vista. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Middle school and high school students convened Tuesday in Isla Vista, asking community leaders to acknowledge the need for a safe, peaceful community conducive to their busy schedules.</p>\n<p>About 35 teenage students from schools throughout Santa Barbara County presented findings from their survey of 200 I.V. residents indicating that Isla Vistans are overwhelmingly concerned about alcohol, drugs and noise in the community.</p>\n<p>For several weeks, the students split into groups and canvassed I.V., asking 200 residents — almost half of which were college students — what they found problematic in the area.</p>\n<p>Of the 200 residents surveyed, 88.5 percent said alcohol is a problem in I.V., 84 percent said drugs are a problem and 85 percent said noise is an issue on the weekends.</p>\n<p>“Some of my nights when I’m in Isla Vista doing my homework, it can be really noisy,” said one 15-year-old who presented some of the findings Tuesday. “I am a student, too.”</p>\n<p>Named “I’m a Student, Too!,” the event sought to remind UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students that there are younger students in I.V. who attend middle schools and high schools in the county.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 200 residents surveyed, the students also asked 100 locals for their favorite thing about I.V., recording responses including the beach, the warm weather, Freebirds and the Children’s Park. Nearly 80 percent of participants said they love living in I.V.</p>\n<p>The students spoke to a crowd of about 45 in the St. George Family Youth Center (formerly the I.V. Teen Center), which co-hosted the event with Future Leaders of America (FLA), a local nonprofit that works with low-income Latino/a youth.</p>\n<p>“As youth, we want to reduce drugs and alcohol and drug consumption in I.V.,” said Oscar Rojas, 16, a sophomore at Dos Pueblos High School and a member of FLA. “We believe that the best way to deal with these issues is to work as a collaborative team with UCSB, SBCC, the County of [Santa Barbara] and community nonprofits and our families.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70450\" style=\"width: 373px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70450\" data-attachment-id=\"70450\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/student-survey-by-nicholas-bogel-burroughs-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Student Survey 4/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70450\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=363%2C272\" alt=\"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs / Daily Nexus\" width=\"363\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Student-Survey-by-Nicholas-Bogel-Burroughs-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">More than 30 students from schools around Santa Barbara County presented findings from their survey of Isla Vista on Tuesday. <em>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Leonor Reyes, director of the St. George Family Youth Center, said the “general party culture” blinds some students to the families living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I work with a lot of college students who come in [the center] and it’s the first time they realize there are students and teens in Isla Vista,” Reyes said.</p>\n<p>The student group recommended three means by which to alleviate the party culture that, at times, hinders students from focusing on homework or falling asleep.</p>\n<p>First, make I.V. residents aware of children and teens who live and study within the community; second, increase the media coverage of positive I.V. activities; and third, add classes or programs to UCSB’s curriculum that educate students on the composition and history of the area.</p>\n<p>Eder Gaona-Macedo, the executive director of FLA, proposed the creation of “cultural sensitivity training” for UCSB students during freshman orientation, telling them that there are families in I.V. and that “the party isn’t conducive to everyone, especially the young kids.”</p>\n<p>Nicole, 15, was born and raised in I.V. and now attends Dos Pueblos High School. She said the noise is the most difficult part of living in I.V., adding that she often sees people smoking and drinking at a park near her house, although the problem is improving.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I’m not able to go outside to enjoy the park,” she said. “I hope it gets better. It’s gotten way better in the last few years.”</p>\n<p>Maria, a 13-year-old student at Goleta Valley Junior High, said she enjoys the beaches and getting food with friends in I.V., but gets annoyed by the noise from parties.</p>\n<p>“On weekends or holidays — Halloween or Deltopia — it gets really loud, but other days I like living here,” she said, adding that the noise “is frustrating and sometimes keeps me from sleeping.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70477\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70477\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/","id":4607,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[4606,4605,4604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The meeting focused on whether or not the CSD should establish a tenant mediation program and, if it is established, what its specific design and functions should be. I.V. residents will vote in November of 2016 on whether or not to approve the formation of a CSD.</p>\n<p>According to Community Organizer from Assemblymember Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott, a tenant mediation program would be the simplest service to establish because it would not directly conflict with any state’s codes for CSDs.</p>\n<p>City of Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program representative Andrea Bifano, who sits on the Rental Housing Mediation Task Force for the potential CSD, describes mediation as a process that “empowers” disputing parties to reach a resolution.</p>\n<p>“A neutral third party helps facilitate communication by clarifying both the views and positions and helping the parties come up with their own solutions,” Vivano said. “Often times, people are in a situation or relationship that they need to continue, and if they don’t work out their dispute it could escalate and lead to conviction, which is something we would like to prevent.”</p>\n<p>Elliott said that the UCSB Community Housing Office is currently the only tenant mediation service for students living in I.V., and it is not available to non-student UCSB resident of I.V., such as Santa Barbara City College students.</p>\n<p>“They provide tenant mediation for all students, faculty and staff of UCSB. They handle 500 cases a year, 85 percent of those are people that reside in Isla Vista,” Elliott said. “A lot of SBCC students that live in I.V., a lot of non-student renters that live in I.V., they don’t have any sort of tenant mediation offered to them … This is why this service became one of our top priorities.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) and fourth-year English and sociology double-major Clara Perez said IVTU advocates for tenants and empowers them to fight for their rights but does not provide mediation.</p>\n<p>“We have recently worked to fight with eviction cases,” Perez said. “We work to bring awareness to the community about how families and students are being treated by their landlords.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Downtown Business Association Vice President Jay Freeman said a CSD might not provide the power needed to run an effective tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, I think we’re kind of hamster-wheeling on some of these issues, because the form of government that we’ve been able to come up with and been able to construct doesn’t allow us to have the kinds of land use power that will allow us to have the kind of teeth that would actually allow us to force landlords to do anything,” Freeman said. “We need a city or a county to actually step in and do something.”</p>\n<p>Perez said IVTU could “be those teeth” by advocating for tenants if landlords do not cooperate.</p>\n<p>“We can’t necessarily get involved as far as the mediation goes, but if landlords are refusing to come to mediation tables, we want to know,” Perez said. “We want to know if anyone’s rights are being neglected so that we can have their back and put them on blast.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-possible-new-tenant-mediation-services/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-possible-new-tenant-mediation-services/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-possible-new-tenant-mediation-services/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-possible-new-tenant-mediation-services/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-possible-new-tenant-mediation-services/","id":4608,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[4607,4606,4605],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
