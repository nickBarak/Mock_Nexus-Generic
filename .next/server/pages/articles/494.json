However, not until late in the second half did UCSB put away the scrappy Sea Lions team.</p>\n<p>Point Loma was within 10 points with five minutes left in the game, but a series of buckets from the Gauchos pinned Point Loma into too deep of a hole with little time left. An open three-point shot by junior guard DaJuan Smith extended UCSB’s lead to 60-46 and sealed the win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Big Al showed no signs of regression from last year. The big man logged a team-high 31 minutes, but it was on the glass where his presence was truly felt. Williams’ 19 boards contributed to Santa Barbara’s 45 on the night, a decisive rebounding edge compared to Point Loma’s 24. That led to UCSB outscoring the Sea Lions in second chance opportunities, 20-6.</p>\n<p>After a strong first-half performance, the Gauchos let their guard down in the second half. Point Loma shot significantly better from the field at 45.8 percent, as opposed to 34.6 percent in the first half. Santa Barbara shot a respectable 40.6 percent, but nowhere near the 51.7 percent it shot in the first half.</p>\n<p>Despite the increase, the Gauchos were too much to overcome and led throughout the game. Freshman guard Gabe Vincent got the start and made a strong impression in his debut, scoring 13 points to go with three assists and two steals. A flash of what he can do on the perimeter was seen as he made two shots from three-point range on six attempts.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Michael Bryson added six points with two three-pointers made and senior guard Zalmico Harmon scored eight points on four-of-seven shooting, with a team-high four assists on the night.</p>\n<p>In 15 minutes of action off the bench, junior guard John Green nailed half of his shots, including a three-pointer, to give him seven points and five rebounds. Green, who has been hampered by injury in his collegiate career, will be a key player in the rotation if able to stay healthy.</p>\n<p>For Point Loma, leading the way for the team were senior guard Hayden Lescault and junior guard Judd Welfringer; each scored 12 points on the night for the Sea Lions. Lescault finished tied with team-highs in assists (4) and rebounds (5).</p>\n<p>UCSB will face a much tougher opponent in its first official regular season game against No. 5 Kansas. The Gauchos will take on the Jayhawks at Phog Allen Fieldhouse this Friday and the game will be available to view on ESPN 3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/","id":494,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[493,492,491],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 50 Men’s Team Set to Face Rival No. 53 Cal Poly, Women Travel to Take on Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 50 UCSB men’s tennis team moved up 11 spots to jump No. 53 Cal Poly in the rankings this week as the Blue-Green Rivalry is set to renew tomorrow.

The Aggies’ hot shooting continued against the Gauchos as they ended the game a shade below the aforementioned mark at 49 percent on 25-of-51 shooting, but they made up for it from beyond the arc, making 10-of-20, a major contrast to their 2-of-16 finish in the first meeting.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman recorded her sixth double-double of the season as she led the Gauchos in scoring with 17 points and a game-high 10 rebounds. She finished 5-of-8 from the field and 7-of-7 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Two leads as the teams traded baskets in the opening minutes were UCSB’s only leads during the game.</p>\n<p>Trailing 4-5, UC Davis made an 8-0 run that kickstarted the Aggies, who extended their lead as the game progressed.</p>\n<p>Igniting the scoring stretch was sophomore guard Kourtney Eaton with a midrange jump shot. Never losing its lead after the field goal, UC Davis added to its lead with back-to-back made three-pointers by junior forward Pele Gianotti and junior guard/forward Dani Nafekh on its next two possessions to take a 11-4 lead.</p>\n<p>Gianotti concluded Saturday with a game-high 19 points, going 6-of-12 from the field, 3-of-7 from long range and 4-of-4 at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>A quick layup by Edelman helped UCSB trim Davis’s lead to 13-7 at the end of the period.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting just 34.8 percent from behind the perimeter (8-of-23), it was an improved shooting performance for the Gauchos, as it was their most made three-pointers since creating a new program record on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Coco Miller knocked down more than half of UCSB’s three-pointers, scoring the Gauchos’ first two field goals in the second quarter from downtown to cut their deficit to 13-18. Scoring each of her field goals from deep, Miller tallied 15 points on 5-of-12 and 5-of-9 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>After tying her career high of 27 points in the first game against UCSB, it was expected that redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch would be the Gauchos’ main concern.</p>\n<p>Both Miller and Bertsch played pivotal roles in the second quarter; it was the game’s highest scoring period, with UC Davis taking a 26-21 advantage.</p>\n<p>Miller scored 12 of her 15 points in the period on 4-of-6 shooting, while Bertsch scored 11 points and missed just one shot attempt as she went 5-of-6.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara held the potential Big West Player of the Year to 15 points, Bertsch was efficient with her shot selection as she finished the game 7-of-13 from the field. Her seven-straight points beginning at the 7:36 mark of the second period captured UC Davis’s first double-figure lead of the game at 25-13.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to come within a nine-point deficit after a made three-pointer by Miller, trailing 30-21, but could not contain the Aggies’ streaky shooting of 76.9 percent and entered halftime down 39-27.</p>\n<p>Edelman scored the Gauchos’ first six points of the second half, yet it was their worst shooting quarter; they shot a horrid 18.8 percent from the field (3-of-16) and went 0-of-7 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB once again trimmed UCD’s lead to nine points at 33-42 after a pair of made free throws by Edelman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ comeback efforts were halted as UC Davis embarked on a 10-2 run to close out the third with its largest lead of the game, 52-35.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, UCSB performed best during the fourth quarter, outscoring the Aggies 26-18. It recorded a 56.3 field goal percentage and shot 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>While Edelman padded her stats with eight points in the quarter, redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler was vital during the Gauchos’ late spurt, scoring nine of her 13 points.</p>\n<p>All nine points occurred in the game’s final three minutes, during which at one point she trimmed UC Davis’ lead to 63-56 with 1:36 remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies’ clutch free-throw shooting — making 10-of-12 — led to them securing their victory in their final home game of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home for its final two games of the season. It will face UC Irvine and Blue-Green rival Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76021\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76021\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-loss-to-uc-davis-results-in-third-straight-loss/","id":492,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[491,490,489],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End Senior Night On Happy Note After Win Over UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-03-01-at-1.44.09-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-03-01-at-1.44.09-PM.png?resize=873%2C585&ssl=1","description":"With point guard Eric Childress as the only senior on the team, it was evident that Gauchos played with their hearts on their sleeves as they reigned victorious in their final home game.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As this was UCSB’s home season finale, the home fans were excited and came in numbers, with 1,618 in attendance that night. After a brief ceremony celebrating UCSB’s sole senior, the game got off to a quick start with Highlander junior forward Alex Larsson scoring in the first 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>At 6’10”, Larsson barely had to jump to get the ball in the basket. Although both teams racked up points quickly, raising the score to 20-11 UCSB by 12:30, the Gauchos did a great job of keeping a tight defense. By preventing UCR from driving, UCSB defense was able to keep their score down, but was having trouble guarding the outside three pointers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This night was a celebration of Childress, and whether it was the team’s energy or the fact that it was going to be his last game at the Thunderdome, he was on a roll. Scoring a total of 21 points, he went 4-4 on his first four three pointers and ended up 5-8 overall on threes.</p>\n<p>“You have to work as hard as you can because time flies by and it’s not going to wait for you,” Childress said.</p>\n<p>With Childress on fire and Gaucho defense looking strong, the only slight improvement possible was getting more shots off. The UCSB team was on the same page, had great ball movement and knew where everyone was on the court.</p>\n<p>One effective Highlander tactic utilized throughout the entire game was a hard press. With the Gaucho point guard and one or two other players covered and searching for an open pass, UCR efficiently ran down the UCSB shot clock, giving the Gaucho offense only around 15 seconds to shoot rather than the usual 30.</p>\n<p>UCR senior forward Secean Johnson did not have as great of a half as spectators might have expected. Only putting two points on the board, he was all over the court and takings sloppy shots during the first half, but found his stride in the second period.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played the first half guns blazing, leading by up to 12 multiple times. For the majority of the half UCSB was able to hold onto a 10-point lead.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sophomore forward Jarriesse Blackmon had a great game, both defensively and offensively, even scoring on two separate occasions exactly as the shot clock ran out, sending the crowd into a frenzy both times.</p>\n<p>With two minutes left in the first period, UCR stepped up and managed to bring the score within one point, Gauchos leading 32-31.</p>\n<p>At the half, Gaucho shooting was at a season high with a 54.5 field goal percentage. 15 of 31 Highlander points were from their bench while on the UCSB side of the court, 15 points alone were from star senior Childress, who had made 5-6 three pointers.</p>\n<p>Although he came away with three personal fouls, freshman guard Christian Terrell was an essential asset to the Gaucho victory, not only scoring but also defending.</p>\n<p>“Terrell’s defense made a real difference for us,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In the first half, we did not play anywhere near as well when he was off the floor.”</p>\n<p>Rebounds were bountiful for the Gauchos this game, all players doing a great job of not only getting a first hand on the ball but keeping possession and working as a team to move it up the court. Junior forward Alex Hart was all hands, grabbing an impressive 15 boards this game.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman guards Max Heidegger and Clifton Powell made big runs. Both had the ability to work from either side of the court and shoot from outside. Powell specifically had a great night, especially after a foul that resulted in Highlander points. He turned up the energy and even made a glorious shot from a couple feet outside of the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“In practice, I’ve been working on catching and shooting,” Powell said. “My primary game is getting the ball to the basket.”</p>\n<p>Despite Highlander efforts to catch up to the Gauchos, UCSB was able to keep their lead until the very end. Winning 68-61, the game ended in style with a flying dunk from Terrell.</p>\n<p>The best part of the night was the last minute of the game. Starting with a few fans in the student section and quickly spreading to the entire events center, an “Eric Childress” chant began and continued until the end of the game, with all Gaucho supports on their feet.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great Gaucho performance and a fantastic senior night for Childress. The Gauchos will next face Cal State Fullerton on the road on Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76030\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76030\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/","id":493,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[492,491,490],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
