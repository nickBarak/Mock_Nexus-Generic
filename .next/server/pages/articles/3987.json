Read about their campaign promises and what they plan to do during their times in their respective offices below:</p>\n<p><strong>Governor Gavin Newsom</strong></p>\n<p>Gavin Newsom (D), former San Francisco major and lieutenant governor of California, won the gubernatorial seat in the 2018 midterm election. Newsom campaigned in support of expanding healthcare, diminishing the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) influence on legislation, protecting California’s status as a sanctuary state, closing the gender pay gap and protecting women’s reproductive rights, according to his campaign website.</p>\n<p>His platform consists of expanding economic growth through a new job training system, improving infrastructure and maintaining California values of diversity and social equality.</p>\n<p>He won against his Republican opponent, John Cox.</p>\n<p><strong>Secretary of State Alex Padilla</strong></p>\n<p>Alex Padilla (D) was elected for a second term as secretary of state. During his campaign, he directed voters to his previous terms as secretary of state, state senator and president of Los Angeles City Council.</p>\n<p>Padilla said in his candidate statement that his work in the last four years helped to register millions of eligible voters in California. He pointed to his beginnings as the son of immigrant parents with blue-collar jobs as an indication of his commitment to working-class families.</p>\n<p>He won over the majority of voters against his opponent, Mark Meuser (R).</p>\n<p><strong>California Senator Dianne Feinstein</strong></p>\n<p>Now officially elected to her fifth term in the U.S. Senate, Dianne Feinstein (D) ran on a progressive platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Feinstein cited her experience in the position in previous years for issues including immigrants’ rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and universal healthcare.</p>\n<p>She promised to attack prerogatives of the Trump Agenda such as his anti-immigration policies and proposed oil drilling permits off California’s coast, according to her candidate statement in the 2018 Voter Guide.</p>\n<p>Feinstein won the majority vote against her opponent, Kevin de León (D).</p>\n<p><strong>24th Congressional District Representative Salud Carbajal</strong></p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara alumnus Salud Carbajal won the majority vote for representative of California’s 24th congressional district for a second term. Carbajal campaigned on creating cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to support the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>He pledged to advocate for the middle class, fight for environmental protection, push for safer gun laws and regulations, help to make higher education more affordable, create higher-paying job opportunities and strengthen Medicare and social security.</p>\n<p>He won against his opponent, Justin Fareed (R).</p>\n<p><strong>State Assembly 37th District Representative Monique Limón</strong></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native and Goleta resident Monique Limón won another term as representative of the 37th state assembly district. She campaigned on her years of experience in higher education, especially at UCSB working in various departments to increase diversity and assist in transitions from college to graduate school.</p>\n<p>She promised to advocate for education, defend the environment and expand opportunities for job training and internships, according to her campaign websites.</p>\n<p>She won the majority in a landslide vote against her opponent, David Norrdin (D).</p>\n<p><strong>Goleta Union School District</strong></p>\n<p>Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats in the Goleta Union School District race.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure G2018 County Ordinance</strong></p>\n<p>Measure G proposed a redistricting of Santa Barbara County which would be spearheaded by the Santa Barbara Citizens’ Independent Redistricting Commission. The measure will establish clear procedures for determining electoral district boundaries within the county.</p>\n<p>The commission leading the redistricting will be designed to be free of influence from campaign contributors, political parties, special financial interests and more as well as be representative of diversity in the county.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure Z2018 City Goleta Cannabis Tax</strong></p>\n<p>Measure Z passed overwhelmingly in the midterm elections, placing a tax on cannabis businesses in Goleta to provide revenue to be used by the city of Goleta.</p>\n<p>The measure will impose taxes on individual processes of the cannabis industry in Goleta, including cannabis distribution/transportation, cannabis cultivation and cannabis processing/manufacturing. It will exclude the sale of medical cannabis and cannabis testing.</p>\n<p>The tax is expected to go into effect 10 days after the vote is declared by the city council, according to the Measure Z ordinance.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [Nov. 21]: Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats within the Goleta Union School District.

Today, they have the second largest number of active electric buses out of any transit system in California, the press release stated.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to making this happen,” Jerry Estrada, SBMTD general manager, said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“The whole team at Santa Barbara MTD is proud of our pioneering work in battery-electric transit, and we look forward to continuing to lead the industry towards a zero-emissions future.”</p>\n<p>The cost of this transition is unknown, as bus prices tend to fluctuate significantly with the market, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>SBMTD recently purchased 14 new 30-foot electric buses, costing $380,000 per bus, she said. The 30-foot buses are used for shuttle service in Santa Barbara; however, for downtown, waterfront and crosstown shuttle, Blackerby projects they would need 40 to 60-foot buses.</p>\n<p>The latter would likely have steeper costs.</p>\n<p>The zero-emissions project will be financed by a combination of funding from the Federal Transit Association, state funding and other grants, Blackerby said. The transition to zero-emission buses will take place as the current buses reach the end of their useful life.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the California Air Resources Board – an organization dedicated to maintaining healthy air quality – is expected to adopt new statewide clean air standards in 2019 which would gradually phase in requirements for public transit agencies to purchase only zero-emission buses over the next few decades.</p>\n<p>These expectations will be met by SBMTD before the new standard is implemented, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>“By setting this goal, MTD can plan this transition, build the necessary charging infrastructure, send a market signal to bus manufacturers, and set Santa Barbara on the path to 100% clean, quiet electric buses powered by 100% renewable energy,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>The transition to zero-emission buses was also due in part to community organizations, including the Community Environmental Council and the local chapter of the Sierra Club. The groups worked to garner support for the plan from other community groups and individuals, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>SBMTD Board Chair Dave Davis said fulfilling the transition will be challenging, but feasible with help from local partners and the transit industry.</p>\n<p>“The MTD Board of Directors knows that it is the right thing to do for our agency, our community, and our planet,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Senate Monday, opening an on-campus senator positon.</p>\n<p>Wright is currently studying abroad at Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London and has been participating in Senate through a proxy, second-year computer science and statistics double major Tarush Mohanti. Although she has resigned as senator, Wright plans to continue as UC Student Association Alumni Relations Officer, the Michael D. Young intern to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and a member of the Working Group for the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault.</p>\n<p>Wright said the limits on the role she could play as senator while studying abroad contributed to her resignation.</p>\n<p>“Within my own projects, Tarush was coordinating with me so I could work on most of them remotely,” Wright said. “But I found out that I was not going to be allowed to submit legislation through him while I am abroad, essentially preventing me from doing any work while I’m away and negating all the work we had been doing, which I felt was unfair to the student body.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S operates as a “huge bureaucracy” whose policies inhibit with progresses.</p>\n<p>“All of its rules and regulations, instead of making it easier to facilitate work, have fostered a system of inefficiency,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>According to Wright, Senate members demonstrated patterns of behavior that “perpetuate discrimination, pre-conceived bias and downright hostility.”</p>\n<p>“Personally, I’ve consistently had my motives questioned, particularly from people who assumed I made my relationship choices based on my professional aspirations,” Wright said. “So often mental health and well-being of students is disregarded, which is horrible to see from an organization that promotes mental health reform and de-stigmatization.”</p>\n<p>Wright said A.S.’s “competitive environment” was one reason she chose to resign.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is filled with so many amazing and passionate people with the best of intentions,” Wright said. “However, in executing projects, many people — not all, but many — often can become territorial over their projects both to retain control over it but also to garner the most credit.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science double major and on-campus senator Nawar Nemeh said he agrees the Senate environment is one of unproductive competition.</p>\n<p>“Her resignation saddens me deeply but I understand it,” Nemeh said. “There’s a lot of cynicism about the intentions of others. I fear that this makes it harder for some people to get their reforms through.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he wants to solve the issues that drove Wright to resign by collaborating with other senators and being accessible to campus organizations.<br>\n“I am going to start reaching out to more senators I don’t usually work with and be a resource for people who need it,” Nemeh said.<br>\nWright said her “proudest accomplishments” at UCSB happened before her term as senator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gotten UCSB Campus Regulation changed to be fairer to [sexual assault] survivors, I’ve garnered over a thousand signatures for a petition to the Regents’ requesting additional funding for consent programs and helped organize over a dozen lobby visits,” Wright said. “I found Senate a more difficult environment to complete my projects in.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/a-s-senator-resigns-due-to-complications/","id":3985,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[3984,3983,3982],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Finance and Business Committee (F&amp;B) met in the State Street Room of the UCen on Monday to approve funding requests for 12 campus groups and discuss two internal bills.</p>\n<p>The current budget stands at $57,198.05 in Office Student Life (OSL), $8,665.26 in Senate Unallocated, $ 45,000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP), $45,000 in Culture and Graduation, $30,000 in Sports Teams and $17,164 in Academic Teams.</p>\n<p>Fully funded groups included Active Minds for $1,802 in travel and hotel expenses for an organization conference, Gamma Phi Beta sorority for $1,770 for Crescent Classic Pancake Breakfast event, Pi Beta Phi sorority for $1,989 for Air Jam Dance Marathon, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) for $1,901 for a FBLA conference, Black Quare for $3,000 for Trans Revolution talk series and Surf Team for $3,000 in annual team costs.</p>\n<p>Partially funded groups included Zeta Phi Rho fraternity for $320 of $370 for a haunted house with Isla Vista Youth Projects, Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority for $735 of $835 for Kappa Dash 5K Color Run, International Student Association for $470 of $670 for ‘Go’ board game night and mixer and Hermanos Unidos for $1307 of $1370 for a community Thanksgiving dinner.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club’s request of $1,000 in furnishing for annual Beach Ball dance competition was tabled until the group finds additional sources of funding and furniture rental.</p>\n<p>Philanthropy Chair of Kappa Kappa Gamma and fourth-year communication and global studies double major Maggie Vlaco said the sorority will donate all proceeds from Kappa Dash 5K Color Run to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer research foundation.</p>\n<p>“We started this 10 to 15 years ago because one of our members passed away from ovarian cancer while attending UCSB, so it’s in memoriam of her,” Vlaco said. “We had over 300 participants last year and we raised over $5,000.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Susana Abdurahman said bringing transgender activist Cece McDonald to the Trans Revolution series at UCSB is extremely significant to the queer community because McDonald is a black transgender woman who was imprisoned in a men’s prison after defending herself from a racist and transphobic attack.</p>\n<p>“By defending herself, the man who attacked her was killed, and she was put in a men’s prison for 19 months,” Abdurahman said. “We are really excited to bring someone who has been a phenomenal activist for black and trans rights to come have a conversation with us about prison reform.”</p>\n<p>Co-captain of UCSB Surf Team and second-year pre-communication major Stephanie Schechter said because the team does not receive sufficient funding from the university, individual athletes must pay registration fees for the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA).</p>\n<p>“We have 14 national titles, but unfortunately we don’t receive very much funding or donations,” Schechter said. “Our team has to pay our own travel expenses. Our yearly costs are about $14,820, so we are requesting registration funds for NSSA.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds Co-Publicity Chair and Co-Events Chair Marisa Jones said it is an honor for UCSB representatives to speak at the national conference, which will focus on the organization’s goal of eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a five-star chapter at UCSB for six years in a row,” Jones said. “Only a few chapters have been able to speak, so we’re excited to be able to represent UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65285\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"718504292\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65328\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65285\" data-attachment-id=\"65285\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/finance-and-business_-by-oliver-zuniga-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444626351\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"53\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance and Business_ by Oliver Zuniga-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65285\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) collegiate senator and third-year CCS biochemistry and bioengineering major Dustin Larrazolo motioned a discussion about funding for Greek organizations, saying there should be a lower funding limit for Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic events.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that all IFC or Pan groups are one entity, but I don’t think Greek organizations should be getting these blank checks,” Larrazolo said. “I also believe this is a conflict of interest because there are IFC members here. It doesn’t seem entirely appropriate; if we do fund [Greek organizations] there should be a smaller cap.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo also said A.S funds should be reserved for students who require funding to attend the university.</p>\n<p>“I think these funds should be going toward students of color, undocumented students, students who require resources to continue attending the university as opposed to building up haunted house for I.V. Youth,” Larrazolo said. “I think that’s great, but it’s not our job to be a sponsor.”</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer of F&amp;B Kevin Koo said he does not oppose the allocation of funds to Greek organizations because they comprise a large portion of the student population.</p>\n<p>“They are accessing a lot of students and they are raising a lot of money. It’s beneficial for the community and the school,” Koo said. “I think the bigger issue is if philanthropies fall within our guidelines — if they do, I don’t see a problem with that.”</p>\n<p>Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez told F&amp;B about A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal’s plans to reallocate $9,000 from the A.S. Leadership fund to use for professional development.</p>\n<p>Senator Larrazolo also introduced a Bill to Redefine the A.S. Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital Fund (S.T.A.R.K.), amending the bill to allocate $4,000 dollars to the CCS student council and $4,000 dollars to the College of Engineering student council. According to Larrazolo, the current S.T.A.R.K. fund is meant to stimulate science research but is generally discussed in A.S. senate meetings rather than made accessible to CCS and the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“I can’t speak for the College of Engineering, but through CCS we require students to participate at a quarterly symposium at CCS,” Larrazolo said. “When someone receives funding we want to make sure they’ve actually made progress and [are] completing their mission statement.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65328\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65328\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/","id":3986,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3985,3984,3983],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
