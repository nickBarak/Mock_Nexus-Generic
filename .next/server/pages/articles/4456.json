They are just one game behind with a 30-18 overall record and an impressive 14-4 mark in Big West action. The Gauchos, however, have won their last three weekend series with Big West opponents and now sit in fifth place at 25-20 and 10-8 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Northridge heads into the game riding high off of its last win as the team defeated No. 8 UCLA 4-1 on the road on Tuesday, a team the Gauchos had previously fallen to 12-3 way back in February.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Not only have the Matadors defeated one of the top-ranked teams, but they have now won eight games in a row as they head into the weekend series.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a lot going for them as well. Since grabbing a win in the series finale at Fullerton, the Gauchos have gone 8-4, capturing three straight weekend series against conference opponents and now have had two straight Big West players of the week and three in the last four.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Joey Epperson takes the award from sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell this week as he was nearly unstoppable at the plate. Epperson went 8-14, extending his hitting streak to 12 games, with six runs scored, four RBI, a stolen base and a home run. The home run came in the bottom of the ninth with a runner on down by one in Sunday’s series finale with Irvine. Epperson took the first pitch deep against the Anteaters closer. On Friday’s game, Epperson had a four-hit day and was just a home run shy of the cycle.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offense has really found its stride as of late. With the pitching staff struggling to stay healthy, the offense has been more than willing to put up as many runs as needed. Three Gauchos have had hitting streaks of nine or more games, with Epperson and Newell at 12 and 11 respectively. Sophomore shortstop Woody Woodward, who sits at nine games, could have been player of the week as he went 5-12 this weekend with five RBI.</p>\n<p>Northridge, however, is second in the league this year as a team in runs scored and RBI. Junior first baseman Josh Goossen-Brown leads the Big West conference with 43 RBI so far this year, as he has established himself as a major threat in the heart of the Matador order.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Miles Williams is also a player to keep an eye on. UCSB will look to keep runners off the bases while he is at the plate, as he has hit seven home runs this year in just 86 at bats.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Matadors set to show down at 3 p.m. on Friday at Matador field. Games two and three will both be at 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1287815177\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51272\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/surging-gauchos-face-red-hot-northridge/baseball_magaligauthier-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=3456%2C5184&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3456,5184\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1361900171\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"240\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51273\" alt=\"Baseball_MagaliGauthier\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MagaliGauthier1-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 9, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Jacome threw six and one-third solid innings, allowing seven hits on just one earned run.</p>\n<p>“Jacome came out for his first appearance since he sprained his ankle pretty bad and didn’t fall behind until the last batter he faced,” senior third baseman Marc Venning said. “He really pounded the strike zone and we got him an early lead. The plan was to let them get themselves out and let our defense work behind him and that’s exactly what he did.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense that walked off with a bunt on Monday stayed white hot as the team put up 11 runs on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>The outburst began in the second inning when Monday’s hero in sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell led off the inning with a single. Newell stole second and was then doubled home by senior third baseman Marc Venning to plate the first run in the three-run inning.</p>\n<p>“I’m not totally healed yet but I wanted to come back and play my last 14 games and finish out my career and help the team out how I can,” Venning said. “We really swung the bats well today and they made a few mistakes defensively but we capitalized on those mistakes and made them pay.”</p>\n<p>Later in the inning, with runners on first and third, junior catcher Jackson Morrow laid down a bunt that was misplayed by LMU’s senior pitcher Matt Florer, which led to Morrow’s first of four RBI on the day. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon grounded into a double play, but the third run would score on the play.</p>\n<p>In the top of the third, the Gauchos would strike for four more runs. With the bases loaded, Morrow singled to score the first two runs of the inning. Morrow’s base hit was followed by an RBI single by junior left fielder Joey Epperson and another misplayed ball off Trinkwon’s bat led to a four-run inning.</p>\n<p>Up 7-0 already, the Gauchos again put a four spot on the Lions. Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa and Newell’s back-to-back singles drove in a run each. Morrow drove in his fourth run of the day with another base hit as he went 2-3 with four RBI and a run scored. Epperson drove in the Gauchos final run with a sac fly to score Venning.</p>\n<p>LMU was able to muster some offense late with a three-run seventh inning. Jacome got into his first bit of trouble allowing a leadoff double. He was then lifted for senior pitcher Jared Wilson, who gave up a single to sophomore catcher Chris Barnett, driving in the Lions’ first run. Two more runs would come around to score before Wilson finished off the inning.</p>\n<p>Wilson worked a scoreless eighth followed by sophomore catcher Campbell Wear’s scoreless ninth to close out the victory 11-3.</p>\n<p>The busy week will continue as the Gauchos will take on Pacific at home this weekend for a three-game series with their fellow Big West combatants. The Tigers head south, tied with UC Davis for last place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Pacific currently sits at 13-34 and 5-16 in conference action. The Tigers have, however, gone 3-3 over their last six outings.</p>\n<p>The Tiger offense is led by senior third baseman Dustin Torchio. Torchio leads Pacific with 54 hits and 25 RBI on the season. On Sunday against UC Davis, Torchio went 3-5 with three runs scored and an RBI in the 10-7 loss.</p>\n<p>On the mound Friday for Pacific will be junior Justin Haberman. Haberman has thrown 61.2 innings this year as he has been the most reliable starter for the Tigers. He currently holds a 5.11 ERA and a 1-5 record but has the ability to throw up some zeros. For his lone win this year Haberman shut down Long Beach State.

For the Gauchos, junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa has been the team’s run producer and power hitter, leading the team with 29 RBIs and seven homeruns. Epperson is ranked second in the nation in batting average with a .478 clip and slugging an impressive .630.</p>\n<p>“I have had some success, but there’s no extra pressure on me,” Epperson said. “I kind of feel like I can just go up and put the barrel on the baseball and have a quality at-bat.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly boasts a solid lineup down the order with four hitters hitting above .300. Junior outfielder Nick Torres leads the teams with four homeruns and 28 RBIs, to go along with a .355 batting average, second-best in the lineup.</p>\n<p>With two of the best offenses squaring off against each other, pitching will be crucial with UCSB’s depth being vital in gaining the upper hand.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone made his second appearance of the year against Hawaii in his comeback from injury sustained during the offseason. Limited to pitch count, the team’s ace tossed five innings of three-hit ball and gave up no runs. Slated to pitch this weekend, Checketts will still keep the right-hander to a pitch count, albeit a higher one.</p>\n<p>“The last two [starts] were more restricted or there were certain amounts of pitches I could make,” Pettibone said. “This [start] is kind of based on how I’m feeling. If I feel good, I’ll keep going and if I don’t, then I’ll pass it on to the bullpen.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will counter with junior Matt Imhof on the mound. The lefty is ranked near the top with a 1.05 ERA and is 6-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>First pitch Friday at Baggett Stadium is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-ready-for-blue-green-rivalry-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-ready-for-blue-green-rivalry-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-ready-for-blue-green-rivalry-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-ready-for-blue-green-rivalry-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/ucsb-ready-for-blue-green-rivalry-series/","id":4454,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4453,4452,4451],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Soon To Be 6700 Sabado","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Representatives from Santa Barbara County announced Thursday that the county will be installing a continuous sidewalk through Sabado Tarde Road in the spring.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74938\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74938\" data-attachment-id=\"74938\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/sabado-by-pei-chiao-lin/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sabado-by-pei-chiao-lin\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74938\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sabado-by-Pei-Chiao-Lin-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"The project is funded by both the Santa Barbara County Community Development Block Grant Program and UCSB, and it will cost $750,000.

The project aims to make Isla Vista and its roads more pedestrian-friendly. <em>Pei Chiao Lin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Representatives from Santa Barbara County announced Thursday that the county will be installing a continuous sidewalk through Sabado Tarde Road in the spring.</p>\n<p>According to Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, the county will add more sidewalks on the 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road. Curb ramps will be placed in several intersections along Sueno Road.</p>\n<p>Residents of these parts of Sabado Tarde Road will not have to wait long for the completion of this project. McGolpin projects it will be underway in the beginning of this spring, and he estimates construction will take approximately three months.</p>\n<p>This project, which bears a cost of $750,000, is being funded equally by the Santa Barbara County Community Development Block Grant Program and UC Santa Barbara. Each is allocating $2 million for this project and similar public works projects in the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>According to George Thurlow, UCSB special assistant for Isla Vista affairs, the project is part of the “joint county-university” safety improvements in Isla Vista. He said the University has pledged $2 million over the next 10 years to be matched by the county for sidewalks, streetlights and traffic improvements.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to have sidewalks on at least one side of all the streets in Isla Vista,” he said.</p>\n<p>The project is a continuation of an effort by the Santa Barbara Public Works Department to make Isla Vista more pedestrian-friendly. It was preceded by sidewalk installment projects on Del Playa Drive and Sueno Road throughout the last several years.</p>\n<p>“The community originally didn’t have sidewalks,” McGolpin said. “It takes time and money, and we’re slowly chipping away at it.”</p>\n<p>As of now, continuous sidewalks are sparse in Isla Vista. The county installed a long stretch of sidewalks along Del Playa Drive in 2002, and other streets have received segments of sidewalks over the following years. There are still many blocks in Isla Vista that do not have a consistent stretch of sidewalk.</p>\n<p>“Normally in California the way sidewalks get constructed is when you have an area that is going to be developed, you decide you want sidewalks and then you require developers to provide a sidewalk in front of their section of land,” said Jay Freeman, an 18-year Isla Vista resident and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the case during the development of Isla Vista. Although certain houses in the designated area of Sabado Tarde Road already have a sidewalk in front of them, they were installed during housing redevelopment.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the project seeks to change this so that every house on these blocks has a sidewalk without having to redevelop properties.</p>\n<p>Another motive for this sidewalk project is to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In recent years, long-time Isla Vista residents have advocated for easier wheelchair access throughout the town, a large reason for the increase in sidewalks and curb ramps.</p>\n<p>These projects will have a focus on public and safety improvements, as well as “traffic-calming”<br>\nmeasures.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/","id":4455,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[4454,4453,4452],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
