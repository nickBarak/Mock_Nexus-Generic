Of the 40 teams participating, UCSB will directly compete against four randomly selected teams in two civil trials per day, in which the teams will alternate as plaintiff and defendant. </p>\n<p>According to Mock Trial Vice President and second-year history major Cheryl Wilson, the invitation to Yale is a sign of Mock Trial’s strong reputation as a competitive team.</p>\n<p>“The way that invitationals usually work is that teams from the area are invited. But for the larger tournaments, they try to recruit teams from the larger areas in the U.S., because at nationals, you go against teams from all over the country,” Wilson said. “So if you’re a well known up-and-coming team from another geographic area, you have a much better chance of being invited.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major and Mock Trial Co-Captain Brett Russell said the tournament will expose UCSB’s team to different competition styles.</p>\n<p>“It’s also a good learning opportunity, because we’ve never seen the styles and the specific attorneys from the East Coast. We definitely could learn a lot from them,” Russell said.  “We see the same teams at every West Coast invitational, and we know almost everyone by name. It becomes kind of a small club.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said the East Coast teams have a large presence in the national competition, which will take place next year.</p>\n<p>“California is a very competitive state for Mock Trial, and we definitely have a pocket of good teams here, but just because there’s so many colleges on the East Coast, a lot of the major teams that win the national competition are from there,” Wilson said. “I would say two or three out of the top 10 teams are usually from California, and the rest are from the East Coast. So for us, it’s an experience to go against upper-level competitors.” </p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy and history double major and Mock Trial Co-Captain Andrew Cavarno said the Yale Invitational is important to the university because it emphasizes the Mock Trial team’s renown national reputation.</p>\n<p>“This is really our first step on the east coast, so how well we do here will definitely influence our national reputation,” Cavarno said.</p>\n<p>According to Cavarno, the six student participants to the Yale invitational have been holding extra practice sessions, but the competition is similar enough to past tournaments in that it will not require a change in the team’s practice style.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been preparing really hard for all of our invitationals, and because they all follow a similar format, we don’t need to prepare specifically for Yale,” Cavarno said, “but I would say that we’ve been preparing a little bit harder.”</p>\n<p>According to Russell, presentation is an important aspect of securing a trial victory.</p>\n<p>“When you’re making an oral argument, like an opening statement, it’s obviously important to have good content,” Russell said, “but what’s often more important is good presentation.”<br>\nWilson said the mock trial team members are confident in their ability to succeed in the competition.</p>\n<p>“We’re going out there to bring the UCSB name out to the East Coast,” Wilson said.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This resolution calls for Senate to get the University of California Board of Regents to develop a plan to divest university funds currently invested in gun manufacturing industries by May 2015 and to execute this plan by December 2015.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Sydney Chanu read a letter on behalf of Bob Weiss, father of May 23 Isla Vista shooting victim Veronika Weiss. In the letter, Weiss condemned the alleged connection between the UC and gun manufacturers. </p>\n<p>“As parents of a victim of gun violence murder at University of California, it sickens us that the university could be invested in firearm manufacturers,” Chanu read, “With over 30,000 gun related deaths every year, and school shootings occurring almost monthly, the gun industry has blood on its hands.”</p>\n<p>Weiss also stated that it is vital students take a stance against gun violence as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>“University of California should act as a leader and ban investments in the gun industry,” Chanu read, “me and my wife ask you to divest now.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats president Krishna Hammond also spoke in support of the bill and said students should investigate the amount of investments the university has tied in gun manufacturing industries.</p>\n<p>“It’s unconscionable that not only could we be financially tied to the gun industry that is directly responsible, but also that we don’t even know how much money were in the hole is,” Hammond said. </p>\n<p>Hammond also said students should urge the UC Regents to reevaluate their values in regard to where they invest their funds. </p>\n<p>“Frankly, it’s unimaginable that the Regents and the administration seems to operate as a Black Ops,” Hammond said. “[They are] invested in extremely negative industries and endeavors. I’m just here to help and ask all of you to vote to divest.”</p>\n<p>In addition, DJ Club president Easton Konn said A.S. misinformed him about A.S. Ticket Office logistics, resulting in the club’s denial of funds for transportation to their Waka Flocka Flame and IAmSu! concert at the Earl Warren Showground this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“I would’ve been happy using A.S. Ticketing. I think it’s a great system. I had no issue with it, neither did anyone in my organization,” Konn said. “The only issue is we were never told that we had to use it. We were actually told the opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Konn, without A.S. funding for buses he will have to deny thousands of students transportation to Saturday’s concert. </p>\n<p>“It’s just really upsetting right now because we have a thousand people on the line, depending on these buses,” Konn said. “I have no idea how to go to all these kids tomorrow and tell them that they can’t get to this concert. I don’t know how to tell them they don’t have buses.”<br>\nSenator and Chairman of the Finance Board Jimmy Villarreal said miscommunication occurred between the DJ Club and A.S., but that regardless he did know if A.S. should fund the buses at all. </p>\n<p>“The initial presentation was basically, ‘Well we don’t want all these kids drunk driving, so let’s get a bus for them.’ We’re paying for those buses,” Villarreal said. “Do we want to be kind of complicit with all these drunk kids going somewhere in the first place? That’s just a lot of liability that maybe we don’t want to be a part of.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article mistakenly stated the meeting took place on Tuesday, though the intended day was Wednesday.

The film profiled nine female activists sharing their own personal experiences. Two Muslim Women’s Rights Activists, Raheel Raza and Jasvinder Sanghera, were featured in the film and spoke at the event, encouraging audience members to become involved issues involving abuse in honor-based societies.</p>\n<p>Author of the book<em> Their Jihad . . . Not My Jihad!</em> and President of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow, Raza said “Honor Diaries”  is designed to motivate victims of oppression to speak out about their experiences of abuse.</p>\n<p>“This is not just a documentary, it is a call for action,” Raza said. “Our purpose is to expose, educate and empower victims of women oppression.”</p>\n<p>According to Raza, giving college students and young adults the opportunity to learn about the oppression of women in honor-based cultures is essential to fighting gender inequality.</p>\n<p>“The youth are the next generation,” Raza said. “They are the future and they need to know the problems that they are going to come up against. We love talking to young people because they have so many questions. I hope they learn something new and I hope that the statistics will shock them into an awareness about what is happening around them.”</p>\n<p>Sigma Theta Psi president and fourth-year psychology major Brenda Santamaria said she hopes that students in attendance were educated by the event and were reminded that “we as women, as humans, should be caring for everyone equally.”</p>\n<p>“I hope that they learned that women around the world face issues that maybe here in the United States aren’t issues,” Santamaria said. “It’s really important to appreciate what we are offered and what other people are not.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Autumn LaTour said after viewing the “Honor Diaries” documentary and hearing Raza and Sanghera speak, she plans to become further involved in the fight for equality for women.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really meaningful to everybody, and not just women, in our society, to become involved in these issues and make sure these issues are talked about and incorporated to promote equality for women,” LaTour said. “I’m planning on becoming an “Honor Diaries” ambassador because most people aren’t aware of these issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Raza, educating students about oppression in honor-based societies is the first step toward promoting change to help “eradicate the problem” of abuse and that social progress depends on individual actions.</p>\n<p>“Unless you speak out,” Raza said. “There won’t be change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I think there’s statistics to say it’s even, percentage wise, worse on our campus than on other campuses,” Potter said. “We see 70 to 80 people come a year at C.A.R.E. to get support, and that’s just the people that come forward.”<br>\nAccording to Potter, the It’s On Us campaign aims to increase support for survivors of sexual violence and create an environment where sexual assault is never acceptable.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people just don’t realize how much we as a society and as a culture perpetuate this problem,” Potter said. “To create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported, I think that’s ultimately what this campaign is doing. It starts sending a message out, especially to survivors, that we are supporting you, and I think all the other stuff will naturally follow that.” </p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and C.A.R.E. staff member Hannah Brown said a shift in societal perspective regarding sexual violence is needed throughout campus and in I.V. </p>\n<p>“There’s so much stigma on being a survivor, and almost no stigma on being an accused perpetrator,” Brown said, “We need to kind of shift that and say, ‘No. It’s not a bad thing to be a survivor. It’s a horrible thing to be a perpetrator.’”</p>\n<p>According to Brown, the campaign aims to be inclusive in order to incite widespread change regarding campus perspective on sexual violence. </p>\n<p>“We are trying really hard to make it a community building thing,” Brown said. “It’s about faculty and staff and students and Isla Vista and the community.  While we are focusing on UCSB, we want it to be a community-building thing. We’re not going to get any major changes if we don’t have everybody working together.” </p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Emma Burley, one of many students who have signed the pledge, said she is pleased that males are also participating in the campaign. </p>\n<p>“Living in a college community with a very party-heavy culture makes us more vulnerable for stuff like this,” Burley said. “I’m really glad to see that there are guys signing this pledge, too, especially since women tend to be more vocal about sexual assault, but it’s not just an issue for women. Men need to be involved in the conversation too.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em><br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/its-on-us-campaign-asks-students-to-pledge-support/","id":2954,"author":{"id":173,"name":"Adelaide Burk"},"related":[2953,2952,2951],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
