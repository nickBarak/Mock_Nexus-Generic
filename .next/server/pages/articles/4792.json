It upset No. 19 UCLA at home and managed to take one game away from Caesar Uyesaka stadium against No. 9 Oregon after an exciting 1-0 match that went 14 innings.</p>\n<p>This weekend the Gauchos will hope to continue their dominance against non-conference opponents. Since 2014, they have gone 61-15-2 against those opponents outside the Big West.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has also been dominant at home since 2014, posting a .803 winning percentage when playing at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, the Hawks are led by catcher Erik Ostberg. The sophomore leads the team in batting average (.429), hits (12), and is tied for the team lead in RBI (5).</p>\n<p>Another solid sophomore for Hartford has been Ben Bengtson. The shortstop is second on the team in batting average (.412), first on the team in slugging percentage (.588), and also tied for first in RBI (5).</p>\n<p>However, Hartford will look to continue its great mound play this season in order to beat UCSB in this series. The pitching staff ranks 59<sup>th</sup> in the country in ERA (3.19), 23<sup>rd</sup> in hits per inning (6.62) and 14<sup>th</sup> in win-loss percentage (0.83).</p>\n<p>Its most dominant pitcher this season has been senior Kyle Gauthier. The right-handed pitcher currently boasts a 0.56 ERA which is tops on both his team and his conference. He will get the start on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to attack the Hawks tough pitching staff with their great offensive firepower. They rank 2<sup>nd</sup> in the Big West in batting average (.297), and on-base percentage (.410), while ranking first in runs scored (88), hits (121), and extra-base hits (26).</p>\n<p>UCSB’s slew of hitters starts with sophomore designated hitter Austin Bush. The DH leads the team and is fourth in the Big West in batting average (.429), first in the team and fifth in the Big West in RBI (12), and first on his team in hits (15).</p>\n<p>Another great hitter has been redshirt junior Andrew Calica. The center fielder has been a great leadoff hitter and is currently first on the team in on-base percentage (.557), third in hits (13) and fifth in batting average (.325).</p>\n<p>Other great hitters include redshirt sophomore J.J Muno who is third in hits with 13 and senior third baseman Ryan Clark who is second on the team in hits (14), and third in batting average (.368).</p>\n<p>Leading the pitching staff for the Gauchos on Friday’s opening match-up is junior Shane Bieber. The right-handed pitcher is currently 2-1 on the season but has struggled a bit posting a 5.40 ERA, 28<sup>th</sup> in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, he is helped by a solid bullpen led by left hander Kyle Nelson who has had an amazing start to the season. The sophomore has allowed only nine hits on the season and no earned runs in 16.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Dating back to last season, he has gone 43 1/3 consecutive innings without allowing an earned run, the longest active streak in the NCAA and a UCSB record. He is one of 26 pitchers that currently has a 0.00 ERA.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not lost a home series to a non-conference opponent since 2013 and hopes to keep it that way against Hartford, a team they have never dropped a series against in school history.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is Friday, March 11 against the University of Hartford at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday’s game is at 2 p.m. as well while Sunday’s begins at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In particular, sophomore David Peterson has had an amazing start to the season. The left-handed pitcher has a 0.69 ERA thanks to only allowing six hits and one earned run in 13 innings pitched. He also has 14 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Another solid pitcher for the No. 9 team is redshirt junior Cole Irvin, who has also had a solid start to the season, posting a 1.29 ERA in his 14 innings pitched. He has only allowed eight hits and two runs while leading the team in strikeouts with 21.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the mound is UCSB and its offense, which has been on fire as of late. It currently leads the Big West in runs scored with 85; the next closest is Cal Poly with 61.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also leads the conference in batting average as a team, RBI, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, hits, doubles hit and triples hit.</p>\n<p>Leading the offense is sophomore DH Austin Bush. The Big West Field Player of the Week’s performance has been great this past weekend. In his last four games he has batted .667 (10-15) and has accounted for 10 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Bush is first on the team and in the conference in batting average with a .542 BA. The sophomore is also second in the Big West and first on the team in RBIs with 12. However, he isn’t alone in leading the charge. Other solid hitters are senior third baseman Ryan Clark, who is second on the team in batting average with a .467, and redshirt sophomore Josh Adams, who leads the team in home runs with two.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Andrew Calica is also an important member of the team; he has done a great job as the lead-off hitter. He is the most efficient on the team at getting on the base with a .565 on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>The storyline of this series will be which team’s strength will overcome the other. Although the Ducks have a great pitching staff, UCSB will look to change that with the hot offense it has been producing lately. In three of the last four games, it has scored over 10 runs.</p>\n<p>This series will also be important if the Gauchos want to gain more respect in terms of national rankings.

That’s my endgame.”</p>\n<p>According to Minoiefar, all individuals invested in the I.V. community are invited to participate in town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“Eventually, everyone who will be here will always have this government to help us aid them,” Minoeifar said. “So, just because you’re not going to be here when you graduate doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be here.

LAFCO is a state-mandated agency present in every California county to oversee the formation of CSDs. AB 3 would establish, by act of the state legislature, an I.V. CSD and thereby bypass the traditional role of LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>The letter was drafted and released at LAFCO’s Feb. 5 meeting and enumerates 11 concerns held by the commission over the bill, primarily regarding the bill’s current lack of specificity over the types of services that would be available in an I.V. CSD and how they would be paid for. Additional concerns questioned the role of the county, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) and UCSB in a CSD, the makeup of the administrative board in a CSD and how the CSD would be governed after it is formed.</p>\n<p>The commission heard over two dozen speakers during its roughly hour-long public comment period, with primarily I.V. residents, property owners and students voicing their concerns. Following public comment, the commission debated the merits of sending the letter, with commissioners Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf along with LAFCO chair and Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr voicing opposition.</p>\n<p>Commissioners Craig Geyer, Jeff Moorhouse, Roger Aceves, Roger Welt and Jim Richardson voted in favor of issuing the letter, with Farr and Wolf voting against.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61164\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61164\" data-attachment-id=\"61164\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/doreen-farr-speaks-at-the-lafco-meeting-on-february-19th/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424355612\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"220\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61164\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on Feb. 19.

We already have law enforcement there,” Mitchell said. “We have a government that deals with those issues already … by creating more government you are asking the students to pay more, you are asking the residents to pay more … we have enough government in Isla Vista already.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61165\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61165\" data-attachment-id=\"61165\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/lafco_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424356580\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61165\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.

By overturning our role in the process to a board like LAFCO we remove our hand from this important step.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also said LAFCO should work to ease tensions between residents of I.V. and LAFCO in order to allow the community to address the concerns the commission is taking on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have some trust issues with you all and I would feel that as a board who is made to represent the interests and assert the interests of local districts you would all be willing to compromise with us on that and understand that,” Schunk said. “By allowing us the determination of continuing these talks … you allow us to move forward and answer the very questions you have presented.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman has agreed to work on a financial feasibility study for an I.V. CSD, and sociology professor Victor Rios has begun an effort to attain $18,000 of university money to fund a demographics study of I.V., to meet the concerns of the LAFCO. Schunk and other speakers also encouraged LAFCO commissioners attend the weekly stakeholders meetings taking place in I.V. to flesh out the specifics of the bill.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Geyer said LAFCO members may be limited in their ability to attend stakeholders meetings because of the Brown Act, a piece of legislation guaranteeing the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.</p>\n<p>“It is hard for commissioners to come to meetings because of the Brown Act,” Geyer said. “We can violate the Brown Act in a very easy manner and I think that’s probably why a lot of us don’t attend.”</p>\n<p>Following public comment, commissioner Moorhouse said LAFCO’s purpose is to create local governments and to encourage county, state and university administrations to assist in demographic and financial feasibility studies.</p>\n<p>“Opposing AB 3 does not mean that LAFCO opposes I.V. self-governance,” Moorhouse said, “LAFCO exists to create local governance, among other things. We are here to help and there is an established process to follow and it works.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2006 law updating the CSD formation process, part of LAFCO’s role in creating a CSD is to ensure 25 percent of residents of the proposed CSD area sign a petition indicating support for the effort.</p>\n<p>Geyer said LAFCO’s role is to ensure public participation in the CSD formation process and expressed concern about inaccessibility of the bill once it moves along in the legislative process.</p>\n<p>“The formation of anything, any special district in Isla Vista, should come back to the local LAFCO. That’s what we are here for. That’s why the legislature invented LAFCO, and LAFCO locally [allows] the public to be involved,” Geyer said. “When this thing heads up to Sacramento, you think you have a hard time making it here [to downtown Santa Barbara], you’re gonna have a real hard time making it up there.”</p>\n<p>The commission amended the several points on the letter before approving it for release. The commission eliminated the first sentence on point three, which falsely stated the bill was introduced in December without public outreach on the concept, when in fact two town hall-style meetings had occurred in the months prior to determine an appropriate form of local government for I.V.</p>\n<p>The commission amended language on point three to reflect concerns that LAFCO would be bypassed as a result of “commission meetings” rather than “community meetings” because of a lack of familiarity with the content of the stakeholders and town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>On item nine, the commission deleted the final sentence, which stated “LAFCO has no authority to deviate from the CSD law regarding makeup of the CSD board” and inserted, “However, if it is determined that state legislation is needed, it could be requested by Santa Barbara LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>On item 11, the language was changed from “if the Isla Vista CSD is formed with LAFCO approval” to “if Isla Vista CSD is formed without LAFCO approval, would the district be subject to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act after the … CSD is formed?”</p>\n<p>Finally, the commission agreed to issue the revised letter undersigned by LAFCO executive officer Paul Hood, rather than LAFCO chair Farr, who opposed moving forward with the letter and had her name signed to the draft released Feb. 5.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/","id":4791,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[4790,4789,4788],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
