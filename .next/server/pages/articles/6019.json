Let me preface this by saying I love dogs and don’t condone killing puppies to make coats, but still, I have to respect Cruella for her great fashion taste and boss attitude. Throughout the film, Cruella had a clear (okay, diabolical) goal and a set plan in mind to get things done. Rather than doing the dirty work herself, she employed two dowdy men to do the job and carried on her life of luxury and extravagance. For the most part, Cruella was the perfect picture of an independent woman with class and elegance, and she had an awesome collection of furs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">DR. HANNIBAL LECTER</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sophie Felice Ho, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Let’s talk charisma. In fact, let’s talk Hannibal. Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Protagonist in the third of a series of suspense novels, this cunning, cultured and multilingual psychiatrist not only delves in the brains of his mental patients — he eats them as well. He’s a cannibal with such class that he prepares gourmet meals from his victims’ flesh, served with a side of fava beans. He’s a master of irony, the man behind the chillingly-charming apology, “I do wish we could chat longer, but I’m having an old friend for dinner.” Besides the fact that he intends to literally have his old friend as dinner, his penchant for wordplay and courteous demeanor fools us all. Hannibal stands most intriguingly terrifying in my world of horror, luring victims in until it’s far, far too late to escape.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">DR. HEINZ DOOFENSHMIRTZ</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Erika Lee, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, the scatterbrained and forgetful evil scientist from “Phineas and Ferb,” is my favorite villain. A hilariously nonthreatening character, Doofenshmirtz is never taken seriously by any of the characters throughout the show. His one-sided rivalry with Perry the Platypus and his sinister plots to take over the tri-state area (that do not ever seem to succeed) never fail to entertain audiences of all ages. After it is revealed that the reason he creates his schemes and inventions is caused by the lack of recognition and love from his unhappy childhood, he becomes a more relatable and likeable character. What makes Dr. Doofenshmirtz so different from other villains is the fact that he’s not actually evil; he’s a human being with insecurities of his own. It also helps that his accent and famous line, “Curse you, Perry the Platypus!” is pretty fun to imitate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">SHAN YU</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kelsey Tang, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Fortune, beauty, love — these are typical goals that villains seek. Shan Yu of the Disney classic “Mulan,” however, seeks power. And in order to seize that power, he looks for complete annexation of China. What makes Shan Yu a respectfully cruel villain is his blindness to gender roles in a traditional, rigid setting that prohibits women from enlisting in the army. He recognizes Mulan as an equal opponent in strength and wit during a time period ridden with strict gender conventions. Shan Yu of the Huns, although unforgiving and brutal, still acknowledges Mulan’s capability. I’m impressed by his forward thinking, and I’m sure Mulan tacitly appreciated the acceptance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">THE DALEKS</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Mackenzie Hart, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!” Anyone that follows the longest running sci-fi show of all time, “Doctor Who,” will recognize that this signature chant originates from the almighty villain of outer space: the Dalek. The Daleks are a strangely cute and simultaneously pesky race of cyborgs whose arms are composed of a plunger and a whisk that shoots lasers. As adorable as they sound, they are not the best kind of people — the reason why the Doctor is the last Time Lord alive is because the Daleks killed off all of the others, including his family. Although they appear to be relentless and stone-cold serial killers, it is revealed in an episode that they are not as inherently evil as they seem — underneath a Dalek’s armor is a little, lonely organism that has feelings too. They may be easy to hate; but as misunderstood little critters, they are hard not to like.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Chinelo Ufondu, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For many, Oct. 31 is a night filled with mischievous bliss and candy-toting children amiss, but for one it was the night where everything was destroyed. He was the most powerful, devious, sassiest dark wizard the world had ever seen. All cowered in his name — I urge you to not say it, for it could be the very last thing you utter. Those that dared to think he was vanquished clearly doubted the clever mind of You-Know-Who, who had a backup plan of survival and broke his immortal soul into pieces. Voldemort was a cunning badass of a wizard, equal parts smart and evil.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">YZMA</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Phi Do, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Flashy, bold and eccentric, Yzma from Disney’s “The Emperor’s New Groove” is always hatching grand schemes to get what she wants. One of her first plans to kill the emperor was to turn him into a flea, put him in a box, put that box in another box, mail that box to herself and smash it with a hammer (though she eventually settles for poison to “save on postage”). A woman of power, Yzma will go through great lengths to reach her goals, even when she gets dumped in a pile of jungle slime. She’s a woman of spunk who has her own roller coaster leading straight to the lab, as long as she presses the right lever, that is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">MAN RAY</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alexandra DeSanto, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ma-ma-ma-MAN RAY! The most evil villain in all of Bikini Bottom has his own place in my childhood. The red and blue villain has his most famous scene when Spongebob and Patrick are watching over the lair of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The best friends try to teach Man Ray to be a good person, resulting in Patrick dropping his wallet as a test. After grabbing the wallet and trying to hand it back to Patrick, Man Ray is refused repeatedly by Patrick, who claims, “Nope, not my wallet.” The exasperation on the face of the villain will forever have a place<br>\nin my memories, along with the giggles of me and my sister.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">THE JOKER</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alec Harnett, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My villain of choice would have to be from the adventures of my favorite comic series hero, Batman. Initially I would probably side with Mr. Freeze, but Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker in “The Dark Knight” wins. The Joker is more menacing than the Riddler, a mysterious villain who sent dangerous gifts to his opponents, on which he would attach a small riddle that usually led to figuring out what the “present” was. Although similar in theatrical flair, the Joker is a crueler character; you do not know what’s coming until it’s already occurred and there is no way to stop him unless something extraordinary happens; at least the Riddler would leave a clue to let you know what was coming.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">FRED FIGGLEHORN</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alex Wehrung, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Fred Figglehorn in “Fred: The Movie” is one of the most defined villains in recent cinema: a stalker suffering from possibly schizophrenic hallucinations who will stop at nothing to get the girl he lusts after: Judy. What he intends to do when he “gets” her remains a mystery throughout the film. Fred is a truly terrifying presence. His high-pitched, constantly-screeching voice strikes terror into the hearts of his enemies and generally confuses everyone else.  He also demonstrates sociopathic tendencies when he pretends to invite people to his party, only to tell them they are not actually invited purely out of spite.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">RICHARD III</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Audrey Bachelder, Artsweek Editor</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Machiavellian Richard III is one of Shakespeare’s greatest masterpieces: a villain so criminally awful that it is almost seductive. Described as a horrifically hunchbacked man, Richard is grossly deformed and cannot walk “straight in front of a nymph.” So it’s a wonder that he is able to woo the beautiful Princess Anne, widow of the Prince of Wales whom Richard murdered.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At first, Anne essentially tells Richard that he should go to hell, and Richard responds that he is fit for one more place: her bedchamber. He proceeds to tell her that her beauty kept him awake at night, and it forced him to kill her husband so that he might lay in her bosom for an hour. Anne, vain cat she is, unravels under the compliments, and she becomes a missus to the murderer. What is so invigorating about Richard is that he manipulates everyone around him and plays the role of an actor so well that his crudeness is taken for flattery.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/","id":6019,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[6018,6017,6016],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[901,914,2145,2155,5849,6019,6661,6794,6801,6814,6834,6838,6857,6866,6879,6885,6906,6907,6911,6924,6929,6938,6942,6968,6969,6973,6987,7755,7758],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Save it for Netflix, Lacks Character Depth","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This film is proof that movies are being split for the sake of profit as opposed to story.

Don’t get me wrong, “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1” is not a bad movie. It’s well-acted, well-shot and never had me laugh in derision (if a movie ever gets me to do that, it’s a sign that the film’s a stinker). It has some standout sequences that were extremely impressive on an emotional level. However, in addition to minimal action, the film still suffers from the same problem as the last two movies: the main characters.</p>\n<p>I’ll address the main character’s issues first. Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress. She deserved her Oscar for “Silver Linings Playbook” and made me laugh in “American Hustle.”<i> </i>But her performance as Katniss Everdeen has always left more to be desired. It’s not bad; it just doesn’t stand out. Katniss has two emotions: bored and anxious. She looks like she’s in the middle of a Greek Mythology lecture unless Peeta happens to be in trouble.</p>\n<p>And I have never been able to sympathize with Katniss, because she is motivated by her love for a boy to save Panem from the Capitol and not much else. I’ll give credit to the film for acknowledging when President Coin expresses her dissatisfaction with Katniss’s belligerent attitude, although it would have been better if, when Katniss told Coin to find another symbol of rebellion, Coin turned to Plutarch and said, “Welp, never mind then. Send in the next angsty teenager!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And fulfilling the yang side of this hormone-driven story, Peeta <i>still </i>manages to come across as having the personality of a block of supermarket cheese: stale and uninteresting. I give credit to Josh Hutcherson for his subdued performance; the trauma that his character goes through is believable. But that doesn’t excuse the fact that he still has little to no personality to his name. Katniss probably should have gone for Gale.  He’s equally bland, but at least he’s bad-ass.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now that I’ve criticized the characters enough, like I do every time I review a “Hunger Games” movie, how were the action scenes? Well, mercifully brief. And to be honest, they were all the same: Capitol stormtroopers come in, slaughter some people and the people win through various flashy means. It looks cool, but it just serves as a reminder that we have to wait another year for the good stuff.</p>\n<p>I appreciated that this movie did not shy away from showing the brutal atrocities of the Capitol. The sight of charred corpses amongst the ruins of District 12 was brutal and effective in showing how callous a government the Capitol is. It felt like something out of a Holocaust film.</p>\n<p>The bunker sequence added a palpable sense of urgency to the movie. The frantic evacuation, the constant, booming sounds of the bombs hitting the surface and the ominous cracks that appear in the ceiling of District 13’s bunker brought together a scene that was extremely effective in conveying the distress and terror that District 13 was subjected to. Also, the sequence allowed Coin to show off her keen intellect and intuition, which is a relief, because otherwise she is not very interesting either.</p>\n<p>What I appreciated most was that the movie added a scene you heard about, but never got to read in the book: the mission to rescue the tributes held captive in the Capitol. It’s a very tense section, reminiscent of the final half hour of “Zero Dark Thirty.”<i> </i>I loved how Katniss talked with President Snow as the raid was happening in an attempt to stall for time, and loved it even more when Snow revealed during their conversation how much of a sadistic, diabolical genius he is. Like most of the other characters, Snow is not complex, but at least he is unnerving.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, I’d say wait for this movie to come out on Netflix unless you’re a die-hard fan of the franchise. Katniss and Peeta still aren’t compelling enough characters to carry the film, the “action” scenes are too few and too short and the number of standout scenes you’ll remember is a mere three. There was not enough story here to justify this being the first of a two-part film.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/friday-flicks-save-it-for-netflix-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-lacks-character-depth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/friday-flicks-save-it-for-netflix-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-lacks-character-depth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/friday-flicks-save-it-for-netflix-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-lacks-character-depth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/friday-flicks-save-it-for-netflix-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-lacks-character-depth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/friday-flicks-save-it-for-netflix-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-lacks-character-depth/","id":6016,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6015,6014,6013],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"American Horror Story Producer and UCSB Alumni Comes to Pollock","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Flipping through television channels often yields the same monotonous results of sitcom after sitcom, recycling the same jokes between different characters and settings.

On Oct. 5, 2011, the American public was reintroduced to a genre that hadn’t been prominent in television for years, if ever: horror. Almost instantaneously, “American Horror Story” garnered a cult-like following, which has only seemed to grow with every new season of the anthology series. From the engaging imagery to the intricate storylines, there’s only so much one can fully process when watching “American Horror Story.” Often the show is taken for little more than entertainment value, and why not? It seems to do a good job at it.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Dec. 1, attendants of a show screening, followed by a talk and Q&amp;A segment with the show’s executive producer and UCSB alumnus Dante Di Loreto in Pollock Theater, got an inside perspective of what actually goes on behind the scenes of the mysterious and captivating series. As it turns out, there’s much more than meets the eye.</p>\n<p>Now in its fourth season, the series has brought back the same core cast to act out a variety of story lines, each exploring a different facet of American history and culture, from the Salem witch trials to the age of traveling freak shows and carnivals.  As it turns out, these seasons are not as divided as it may seem, and avid watchers of the show will soon begin to discover that the varying story lines are interconnected with each other. On this topic, Di Loreto diplomatically declined to offer any comment no matter how hard he was pried. Needless to say, this will call for many rainy afternoons spent re-watching the first few seasons (on Netflix) in search of clues.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The open question portion of the interview opened the floor to audience members to ask Di Loreto questions. Hearing the different questions revealed which unique aspect of the show each person liked most, and all the things different people can take from it. When asked why horror was chosen as the primary theme for the series, his answer was simple: it stimulates the senses. Evidently, horror sells for much of the same reason sex sells: It makes viewers feel something in their bodies that they don’t even need to wrap their heads around.</p>\n<p>Di Loreto also spoke candidly of his life leading up to becoming an executive producer, and all the steps it took to reach his position. This, of course, began with his time spent at UCSB as an undergraduate studying theater in the 1970s, when evidently students “were smoking in class and having sex with the teachers.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB alumnus offered advice on the most important part of becoming a producer, or anything in the entertainment industry, for that matter. His answer? “Friends.” Di Loreto stressed the importance of keeping close relationships with others who also hold a creative vision, and not being cynical about what you want to do. Through close relationships with like-minded people, avant-garde endeavors like “American Horror Story” are born.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/","id":6017,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6016,6015,6014],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Electrosceptic’ Wow-ed by Gartner’s Performance, Despite the ‘Bleeps’ and ‘Bloops’","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Electronic music seems to be taking over the airways, but I have never been able to understand the allure behind it.

In fact, I hate it, and I always have. Whether it is house, techno, dubstep, trance or techno-house-step eurotrance, for me it all falls under the umbrella term of annoying white noise. My personal philosophy is that anything driven by bleeps, bloops, womps, oontzes or any combination thereof should be left out of the music category. Given my relentless distaste for such sounds, one could understandably assume that I did not care for Wolfgang Gartner’s performance at Extravaganza this weekend. As his set progressed, however, I found myself enjoying more and more the spectacle that was unfolding before me.</p>\n<p>As Wolfgang took the stage to play, my first instinct was to flee Harder Stadium and seek recluse in the safety of my apartment. Determined to at least try to broaden my horizons, I decided to simply retreat to the bleachers where I could observe the show from a safer distance. I went close to the very top, and had an excellent view of the mob that was quickly building up in anticipation of the coming storm. Many of my friends listen to electronic music, so I had heard a few of Wolfgang’s songs and thought I knew what to expect from him. What I witnessed next was, surprisingly, one of the most beautiful performances I have seen.</p>\n<p>I quickly realized that watching this type of music performed live in front of a huge crowd is much different than listening to it from a car stereo. Armed with his various synthesizers and sequencers, Wolfgang controlled the ebbs and flows of hundreds of onlookers with the prowess of an experienced puppet master. There was something transfixing about the way he could make them step, wave their arms, or jump in unison, all without uttering a word. While watching the crazed dances of a few ecstasy-driven concertgoers, the thought crossed my mind that this was probably the happiest moments they would ever experience, and I was honored to witness it. During one bass drop in particular, the collective orgasm that the crowd felt even sent shivers down my spine.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Perhaps my favorite part of Wolfgang Gartner’s performance was the fact that, out of everyone attending, he was clearly the one who enjoyed it the most. Too often do I see artists put on a half-assed show so they can collect their check and move on (certain Extravaganza headliners come to mind). In this case, the crowd fed off of Wolfgang’s energy, and it made the whole experience better. He was excited, which made the crowd excited, which made me excited. It was all very exciting.</p>\n<p>Coming out of Extravaganza, I could not say that I would be attending a rave anytime soon. Nor could I say that I liked electronic music anymore because of it. What I did gain was a better understanding of why this craze has swept the country over the past few years, especially within Isla Vista. There was a glimmer of hope that one day I might learn to appreciate these noises.</p>\n<p><em>Piers Fibige is a third-year political science and history major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/","id":6018,"author":{"id":505,"name":"PiersFibige"},"related":[6017,6016,6015],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
