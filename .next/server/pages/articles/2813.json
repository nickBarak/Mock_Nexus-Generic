Shehata is currently the Vice Chairman and Programs Director of the Sadat Association for Development and Social Welfare, and specializes in research on youth mobilization through social media, Al-Qaeda ideology and conflict lines between Christianity and Islam.</p>\n<p>Political Science professor Cynthia Kaplan said she met Shehata in Berlin during the fall of the Berlin Wall and at that time invited him to speak. Shehata holds a first-hand account of what it was like to be on the ground during the Egyptian protests during 2011, according to Kaplan.</p>\n<p>“He is a rather remarkable informant on those events and consequences,” Kaplan said. “It is a wonderful opportunity to hear a perspective from below from someone who was a participant.”</p>\n<p>According to a brief biography written by Shehata for the lecture, he is currently working on human rights issues in Egypt, including “peaceful demonstrations, freedom of opinion, expression and information, and housing rights.”</p>\n<p>Kaplan said aspects of Shehata’s lecture that will be particularly appealing to student audiences involve his extensive involvement in youth mobilization during the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He was essential in organizing youth participation during the events of the Egyptian Revolution and still is,” Kaplan said. “So this idea of social mobilization is very interesting for those who are interested in social movements in general.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaplan, Shehata participated in key negotiations between activists and members of the military and can offer additional unique perspectives to conventional academic studies on the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He took part in roundtables with elites and military members, so his perspective is rather refreshing in that he provides insights that a more academic, distanced study cannot,” Kaplan said.</p>\n<p>First-year communications major Ruben Rodriguez said he is interested in the fall of governments and ruling elites, and looks forward to attending the talk.</p>\n<p>“A lot of governments recently have been overthrown through civil protest, so it’ll be interesting to see [Shehata’s] account of protests in Cairo during 2011,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics and accounting major Nicholas Lynch, his Middle Eastern Studies class this past Fall Quarter peaked his interest in the Egyptian Revolution.</p>\n<p>“The Middle East is still in flux and it would be interesting to not only hear his accounts of the revolution in 2011, but also hear what he has to say about the future state of many other countries in turmoil,” Lynch said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

York City, where they won the Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row<em>. Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Model United Nations (MUN) won an Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row while representing Kuwait and Luxembourg at the National Model U.N. conference in New York last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The 22 members of UCSB MUN spent a little over one academic quarter preparing for the conference, at which they were split into pairs to represent a specific country, sit on various committees with different aims and write up legislation to combat various issues. A majority of the team represented Kuwait, and one pair represented Luxembourg in the Security Council. Over 150 schools and nearly 3,000 people attended the event, which took place from March 29 to April 2.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science and economics double major Jesse Lin said pairs worked together and used current events and the political history of their country to debate and write legislation to resolve present-day issues.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we try to come up with a resolution to solve these problems that the U.N. is facing currently in each of these committees,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major and MUN delegate Benjamin Pu, the Outstanding Delegation award is only given to the top ten percent of participating schools.</p>\n<p>“This is our second year in a row winning it so we’re now established as a good model U.N. school,” Pu said. “If you win once at nationals it might be a fluke, but when you win twice in a row it’s definitely a powerhouse school.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Zeina Rousan said leadership skills shown by individuals on the team greatly contributed to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>“Almost every single person on the team was able to lead a working group; that’s probably why we ended up winning outstanding,” Rousan said. “We each practiced so much, knew so much information about these topics and were trained to be good diplomats that we were able to take all these people competing with us and have them want to work with us and have us lead in writing these resolutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, receiving outstanding delegation was a great accomplishment for the team and reflected the team’s hard work despite the large number of new members.</p>\n<p>“This year with a bigger team it’s really hard to manage, but everyone really tried,” Lin said. “Everyone worked really hard and researched a lot. There was a lot of outside research that they needed to do, and we ended up doing really well even though we had a lot of first-years who hadn’t done this before.”</p>\n<p>According to Pu, many of the members of the team also received individual recognition at the conference.</p>\n<p>“A couple of us took home position paper awards, and a couple of us took home delegate awards for doing the best in committee as well,” Pu said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Paul Krausse said visiting the United Nations headquarters was a memorable experience.</p>\n<p>“As a fourth-year but just a first-year in Model U.N., I felt somewhat intimidated by it but it was really great; we got to go to the U.N. headquarters in New York and that was an incredible experience, walking into Grand Hall was unbelievable,” Krausse said. “For anyone who was in Model U.N. it’s kind of like going to the holy grail of the U.N. That was such an incredible experience.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, a big part of the conference involved networking with people from all over the world and having their legislations recognized.</p>\n<p>“You get to meet a lot of new people in these conferences. You’re not only working together — you’re making friends,” Lin said. “At the end of the day you get to see your work posted on the website, and it makes you feel like you’ve really done something to mitigate these problems.”</p>\n<p>Krausse said faculty advisor for UCSB MUN Galen Stocking contributed greatly to the team, and recently moved to a new position at the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. after working with MUN for the past three years.</p>\n<p>“Galen’s contributions to the UCSB Model U.N. team are unbelievable, and I don’t know where UCSB Model U.N. would be without him,” Krausse said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/","id":2810,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[2809,2808,2807],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Speace’s Pieces: Randy Moss, You Suck and Here’s Why","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Professional athletes are fickle creatures.

Everything is roses and bunny rabbits when the ball bounces their way, but the moment something goes awry, disinterest, disappointment and discontentment sets in. Professional sports teams ebb and flow, with some years being fantastic, and others not so swell. Even though the road becomes considerably tougher during the valley years of a team’s record, it is up to the athlete to adapt to the situation, and improve upon oneself to get to the peaks again.</p>\n<p>Randy Moss doesn’t realize this. Or, more accurately, does realize it, but chooses not to care. See, Moss believes that he is God’s gift to every franchise that is deemed lucky enough to have him. To him, in a perfect world, those that passed on his wondrous talents will feel God’s vengeance in the form of Moss scoring three touchdowns on them in a game. However, the problem here is Moss’ motivation to do so. He is, what I call, the “convenience player.” This means that he plays hard when he wants to play hard. He focuses only when that game is deemed worthy enough to gauge his interest. He outworks and outhustles his opponents only when he feels like he is “on.” Run the correct route when he is having an off game? Why bother? Moss works for Moss, and it is crazy to think otherwise.</p>\n<p>You would think with all the marijuana he presumably smokes that he would learn to relax, and just play his game. See, Moss has had a bit of an issue with the banned substance, stemming all the way back to his days with Notre Dame, I mean, Florida State, or rather, Marshall University. He collected misdemeanors and fines like Pokemon cards, and did not seem to learn his lesson in Minnesota when he allegedly ran into a police officer because she was in his way … when he was making an illegal turn … while high. To this day he has admitted that he smokes it “every blue moon.” Back to the main point here, instead of buckling down, and getting to work because he knows it will help the team, he instead chooses to go off on senseless diatribes about how he is misunderstood, and incorrectly used in offensive schemes. He doesn’t respect his teammates, his coaches, his executives and apparently, not even the caterers anymore. No one is safe from Moss’ blame game except himself.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For a guy who is seemingly so confident in himself, he sure does put a lot of weight on how others think of him. In one of his more “heartfelt” press conferences this season, he contended, “people don’t want to see me do good,” along with the fact that “he doesn’t feel appreciated.” He dwells on the fact that, doggone it, people just don’t like him!  Well, shucks, Randy, how could they not? Constantly chirping about the poor decisions of the coach, the quarterback and the organization is usually the way to win over a football town.  Even more recently, Moss decided to conduct his own interviews with himself, ala a CRAZY PERSON. Moss has grown tiresome in his older age, constantly fretting about his legacy, his salary and his level of “appreciativeness.” The fact remains that Randy Moss was unable to wrap his head around the “team concept” that the best of our world’s sports franchises are built upon. Where that leaves him now, we’ll soon find out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

engineering, computer science, Gevirtz Graduate School of Education (GGSE), and sociology departments, will be held this Saturday from 3 to 7 p.m. in Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>Hosted by the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholars Association and themed “Unveiling the New: In Pursuit of the Next,”  this weekend’s event will feature lectures by chemical engineering Professor Frank Doyle , GGSE lecturer Jason Raley, computer science professor Diana Franklin, sociology professor Victor Rios and sociology Professor Emeritus Thomas Scheff.  Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) is a non-profit organization hosting conferences across the globe. TEDx events are local iterations of TED conferences independently organized by community members.</p>\n<p>According to Doyle, he will be speaking on the development of an artificial pancreas to automate insulin delivery for people with Type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p>“I’ve watched many TED and TEDx lectures over the years and it is humbling and exciting to be asked to give one,” Doyle said in an email. “[I hope to] bring attention to some of the exciting frontiers of research that are happening here at UCSB – especially on medical problems despite the fact that we do not have a medical school.”</p>\n<p>Franklin said she will be discussing the digital divide in the United States — referring to inequalities in access to information and communication technology in different parts of the world — as well as the importance of integrating computer science in elementary school curriculum.</p>\n<p>“The last generation needed to be competent users of computers to succeed professionally, but the innovators of the next generation will need to … understand how to harness the power of computers to create revolutionary products,” Franklin said in an email. “My work has the goal of understanding how to integrate computing into elementary school so that all students, regardless of background, have the opportunity to participate in this revolution.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he plans to speak on reassessing how the Millennial generation, referring to individuals born between the 1980s and mid-2000s, are taught in American schools with an emphasis on teacher effectiveness.</p>\n<p>“In order for us to be successful in the education system, we have to teach to the heart and not just to the mind,” Rios said. “That’s effective teaching — to teach with affection rather than focus on being effective as a teacher. Since this generation is more emotion-based, shouldn’t we teach through emotions?”</p>\n<p>According to Scheff, his talk will focus the fundamental emotion of shame as well as the importance of not hiding emotions.</p>\n<p>“There’s no such thing as a negative emotion. They’re like breathing — they cause trouble only when they’re obstructed,” Scheff said. “It’s not a good idea to hide shame, or any emotion for that matter. You need to work through it.”</p>\n<p>Raley said his talk will discuss the importance of reshaping future discussions on education.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that kids are learning too little — it’s just that they’re learning too much of the wrong thing,” Raley said. “I would love for us to have much more thoughtful conversations about education. I think that the kind of conversations we have … [are] pretty conventional most of the time — the same problems, the same ideas.”</p>\n<p>Third-year zoology major and UCSB TEDx event organizer Edward Trout said he hopes the event will expose students to important ideas otherwise less accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“I think that the idea is finding what’s new, or what maybe even is old and dispersing it to a wider audience,” Trout said. “Scientists, academics — we study things and we make these papers and circulate them among ourselves and they never get out to the public. What’s the point? If all these ideas never leave the ivory tower, nothing’s going to change.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62229\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/tedxucsb-to-feature-professors-in-search-of-next/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62229\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/tedxucsb-to-feature-professors-in-search-of-next/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/tedxucsb-to-feature-professors-in-search-of-next/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/tedxucsb-to-feature-professors-in-search-of-next/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/tedxucsb-to-feature-professors-in-search-of-next/","id":2812,"author":{"id":157,"name":"Kendra Witt"},"related":[2811,2810,2809],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
