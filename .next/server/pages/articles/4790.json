That’s my endgame.”</p>\n<p>According to Minoiefar, all individuals invested in the I.V. community are invited to participate in town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“Eventually, everyone who will be here will always have this government to help us aid them,” Minoeifar said. “So, just because you’re not going to be here when you graduate doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be here. It’s very much connected to everyone here.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the February 19, 2015 print version of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Bruins began the slugfest thanks to redshirt senior Eric Filia’s two-run homer that put his team up 2-0 after the top of the inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to respond with runs of their own in the bottom of the inning due in large part to blunders by UCLA. The No. 21 team in the country allowed three walks and committed two errors that led to two runs for UCSB. The other was thanks to designated hitter Austin Bush’s sac fly RBI that brought in Calica.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara added two more runs in the second inning thanks to Bush’s single that brought in two more runners. This made the score 5-2 in favor of the home team. UCLA would then respond in the top of the third inning getting three runs and tying the game up at five.</p>\n<p>The third top frame resurgence started when junior outfielder Kort Peterson hit a triple bringing in Filia to score. Junior Luke Persico and redshirt freshman Scott Jarvis also had RBI. In the bottom of the third, however, redshirt sophomore Josh Adams hit a home run (1) to put the Gauchos back up, 6-5.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning UCSB would again add three more runs to its lead courtesy of more wild pitches thrown by the Bruins. Sophomore Clay Fisher started the scoring having an RBI-single. After that the next two runs were scored by wild pitches making the score 9-5 in favor of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>UCLA would add one run in the sixth inning courtesy of a Filia RBI-single down the left-field line, however, it could not do much more than that. The pitching by reshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt, sophomore Kyle Nelson, and sophomore Alex Garcia in the final three innings proved to be too much as the Bruins only mustered one hit.</p>\n<p>“Bullpens are like boxes of chocolate; you never know what you’re going to get.” Checketts said. “We got some guys that are good and are starting to settle into roles.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would add two more runs in the eighth inning thanks to another great hit from Bush and another wild pitch which made the final score 11-6.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, UCLA had many blunders that cost them the game as they had two errors and had four wild pitches which led to three runs by UCSB. It still had some solid performances such as Filia who went 3-4 with a home run and an RBI.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also saw great performances, most notably from Bush who continues hit hot streak. The Big West Field Player of the Week and Gwynn Classic MVP had another big night going 3-4 from the plate with four RBI.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to be hitting this good.” Bush said. “The guys before me in the line-up are doing great and it allows me to see some better pitches that I can take advantage of.”</p>\n<p>It was also good to see Bettancourt bounce back from his disappointing performance last week in which he gave up five runs against St. Mary’s which ultimately doomed them. The junior bounced back in a big way giving up one hit while striking out his four batters.</p>\n<p>“Bettancourt last week wasn’t himself.” Checketts said. “I knew that and I still have great confidence in him and I think what we saw today is what we are going to see going forward.”</p>\n<p>Although the Bruins made their share fair of mistakes, the fact remains that the Gauchos are on fire right now. They have scored over 10 runs in three of their last four games and have been blowing teams out.

Week”</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) held a public forum on Isla Vista housing at the Pardall Center Thursday night as part of “I.V. Week,” a series of events created to draw attention to issues related to history, culture, environment, housing and community in I.V.</p>\n<p>During Thursday’s event, attendees shared their experiences renting in I.V. and discussed challenges they have faced with housing prices, management and availability. Attendees then brainstormed various I.V. housing issues to send to university administration and local government officials, including overcrowded housing, rising rental costs, unresponsive landlords and poorly maintained buildings.</p>\n<p>Forum organizer and second-year history major Paola Villegas said she thinks the university is out of touch with housing issues in I.V. and wants to take sentiments expressed at the forum to administrators.</p>\n<p>“There’s a sense, at least from what I’ve heard, that the university doesn’t think there’s a housing crisis in Isla Vista,” Villegas said. “We want to gather stories and facts to show them that there really is a housing crisis.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and second-year history of public policy major Paola De La Cruz said communication between administrators and I.V. residents about housing issues in I.V. is crucial to prompting change.</p>\n<p>“There are many of them [administrators] who believe that there is no housing crisis in Isla Vista,” De La Cruz said. “What we need to do now is really voice our personal issues and list demands for them to address and things that we can do. I don’t think we need someone to come in and save us. This is why we’re meeting here, for us to just do things.”</p>\n<p>Citing her personal experience with housing problems in I.V. as an example, De La Cruz said she was denied a lease because of her parents’ citizenship status when she tried to rent in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Both of my parents are residents, they’re not citizens, and for one of the applications they had to be citizens so my application was denied,” De La Cruz said. “I remember complaining, ‘Why would you reject my applications simply because my parents are residents?’ I am a citizen.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major and IVCRC external chair Daniela Bayon said she has experienced insect infestations and unresponsive apartment management while renting in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I had cockroaches in my second-year apartment and they kept blaming us as tenants even though we didn’t keep trash in the apartment,” Bayon said. “They said, ‘Oh, we sprayed,’ even though they couldn’t provide proof that they engaged in any type of corrective action to make our housing more sanitary.”</p>\n<p>According to Bayon, one possible strategy to solving challenges regarding housing issues in I.V. is to educate students about I.V. housing rights before renting.</p>\n<p>“Maybe during orientation or at the end of students living in the dorms the university [the university] could send out an email or have a training with documents,” Bayon said, “Because the Isla Vista Tenants Union does have all these documents ready and it might be the case that the university can make a publicity campaign regarding knowing your rights as tenants.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/students-discuss-i-v-housing-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/students-discuss-i-v-housing-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/students-discuss-i-v-housing-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/students-discuss-i-v-housing-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/students-discuss-i-v-housing-issues/","id":4788,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4787,4786,4785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Carries Momentum to No. 9 Oregon","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_Baseball_3-1-16_5-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are looking to upset No. 9 Oregon at its home park.

The pitching staff UCSB will face in this series will be the best it has faced this season so far.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Ducks have a slew of pitching options to use against the Gauchos. In particular, sophomore David Peterson has had an amazing start to the season. The left-handed pitcher has a 0.69 ERA thanks to only allowing six hits and one earned run in 13 innings pitched. He also has 14 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Another solid pitcher for the No. 9 team is redshirt junior Cole Irvin, who has also had a solid start to the season, posting a 1.29 ERA in his 14 innings pitched. He has only allowed eight hits and two runs while leading the team in strikeouts with 21.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the mound is UCSB and its offense, which has been on fire as of late. It currently leads the Big West in runs scored with 85; the next closest is Cal Poly with 61.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also leads the conference in batting average as a team, RBI, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, hits, doubles hit and triples hit.</p>\n<p>Leading the offense is sophomore DH Austin Bush. The Big West Field Player of the Week’s performance has been great this past weekend. In his last four games he has batted .667 (10-15) and has accounted for 10 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Bush is first on the team and in the conference in batting average with a .542 BA. The sophomore is also second in the Big West and first on the team in RBIs with 12. However, he isn’t alone in leading the charge. Other solid hitters are senior third baseman Ryan Clark, who is second on the team in batting average with a .467, and redshirt sophomore Josh Adams, who leads the team in home runs with two.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Andrew Calica is also an important member of the team; he has done a great job as the lead-off hitter. He is the most efficient on the team at getting on the base with a .565 on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>The storyline of this series will be which team’s strength will overcome the other. Although the Ducks have a great pitching staff, UCSB will look to change that with the hot offense it has been producing lately. In three of the last four games, it has scored over 10 runs.</p>\n<p>This series will also be important if the Gauchos want to gain more respect in terms of national rankings. Taking a series from the No. 9 team in the country after defeating the No. 21 team handily should be enough to hopefully garner more attention.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next opponent is Oregon in a three-game series which begins Friday, March 4 at PK Park at 6 p.m. Saturday’s game is at 2 p.m., while Sunday’s is at 12 p.m., both at PK Park.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of March 3, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
