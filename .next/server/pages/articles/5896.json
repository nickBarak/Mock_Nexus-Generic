Not since “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” have I been so befuddled. Listening to its financial jargon is like listening to Data explain to Riker how the hypersonic flux transducer can make Picard’s hair grow back (I give full permission to my fellow fan-fic writing nerds to use that idea). This is what happens when you trade your S.T.E.M. major for FAMST.</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, “The Big Short” is complicated when it comes to the finer details. The broad picture is much more transparent, however: in a time span of two years, several people in the financial industry realize the existence of a housing bubble in the United States. Thus, they are able to predict the Great Recession years in advance and profit from the impending financial apocalypse. At the forefront of this is Dr. Michael Burry (Christian Bale), the awkward hedge-fund manager who makes the discovery, as well as Mark Baum (Steve Carell), the misanthropic trader whose personal interest in Wall Street’s moral degradation (as if it could get any lower) runs deep. Both actors lend powerhouse performances to their roles, each leading the film with certain emotional weight to their respective portrayals.</p>\n<p>But all that’s only the broad picture, skimmed down. Like I said before, this movie is full of enough financial jargon to make you see dollar signs. Unless you have particular knowledge of what CDO or BB ratings are, you’ll have an easier time finding out why people still think the Kardashians are relevant than understanding the dialogue. The movie is, however, aware of the perplexing nature of the terminology and every so often humorously stops the action to have real-life celebrities explain what the fuck something like a subprime loan is (according to Margot Robbie, who is radiantly lounging in an immersive bubble bath whilst talking to the camera, just equate the word subprime with shit and you’re all set).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That brings me to the film’s greatest strength: its acidic wit. The characters frequently break the fourth wall and talk to the camera directly, either to add insight to the already crazy proceedings or to clarify a character’s intentions to humorous effect. For instance, Stanley Wong explains that his boss describes him as an Asian stereotype in order to use their clients’ racism to their advantage. Also, few are safe from the biting observations of both the characters and the film itself. Lines such as “Look at him. His face is going to burst. He looks like the bad guy from Dune,” said by Ryan Gosling’s Jared Vennett of the seething Mark Baum, are peppered throughout. Perhaps nothing sums up “The Big Short” more than this quote, apparently overheard at a bar in Washington, burned across the screen: “Truth is like poetry. And most people fucking hate poetry.”</p>\n<p>When you couple sharp tongues with a cinéma vérité style of filmmaking, I start drawing comparisons to “Veep.” Like the HBO comedy, “The Big Short” is a personal work that thrusts you into the action and provides powerful satire. If the film has a message, it’s this: anyone on Wall Street involved in the bubble were irredeemable assholes. The main characters are indirectly assholes themselves for profiting from a failing economy. In the end, pockets are filled and souls razed. It almost turns the film into a tragedy — a morbid reminder of how many lives the Recession destroyed. “Every time unemployment goes up one percent,” Brad Pitt’s disgruntled Ben Rickert tells two eager up-and-coming investors, “40,000 people die.”</p>\n<p>“The Big Short” shows us the 1 percent in all its smug glory and makes the shut-off and short-fused Baum seem like the most rational person in the entire world. Its humor brings us out of a world of shady dealings and financial insecurity and adds enough levity to allow us to look back on such a dark time of our lives. Or, if you want a more vulgar summation, it’s a funny movie about shitty people taking advantage of the arrogance of other shitty people in order to make a shitload of money. Fun time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67101\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/the-moneys-on-the-humor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67101\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/the-moneys-on-the-humor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/the-moneys-on-the-humor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/the-moneys-on-the-humor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/the-moneys-on-the-humor/","id":5896,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5895,5894,5893],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Magic Lantern Celebrates 50th Anniversary with ‘Citizen Kane’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/citizenkane.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/citizenkane.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Neon flashing lights and enthusiastic calls of “Welcome!” greeted audience members in I.V.

Theater on Monday night as Magic Lantern Films celebrated their 50th year of cinematic appreciation. Crowds in and around the theater buzzed with anticipation, and ushers at the front door urged anyone walking by to come take part in the joyful atmosphere.</p>\n<p>For five decades, the Magic Lantern program has brought movies new and old, known and unknown to I.V. Theater, giving students a place to watch their favorite films or to discover something completely new. Students have flocked to the theater on Monday and Friday nights to see cult classics, vintage dramas, indie releases and even new critically acclaimed films. To honor their 50th anniversary, Magic Lantern Films screened a film as famous and analyzed as its main character: “Citizen Kane.”</p>\n<p>Even in the days before the event, students and professors discussed the upcoming screening with eager curiosity. Throughout the various conversations, there was one phrase that came up whenever the film was mentioned, as people declared the film “the best film ever made.” “Citizen Kane’s” reputation as the most expertly crafted film to date isn’t new. The 1941 classic has been praised by critics and movie-lovers alike for its superiority. So what is it about “Citizen Kane” that makes it the perfect choice for Magic Lantern’s 50th anniversary commemoration?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film focuses on the life of Charles Kane, a rich and famous newspaper owner. At the film’s beginning, Kane has just died, and a group of reporters seek to create the most fascinating newsreel possible about the man. Their goal is to discover the meaning behind the tycoon’s enigmatic last word, “Rosebud.” Kane’s story is told through the flashbacks of various characters as his rise and fall from success is analyzed by everyone.</p>\n<p>From the film’s opening, it’s apparent that director Orson Welles, focuses on contrast in both pacing and scenery. The first scene is shadowy and mysterious. Lightning flashes, the imposing gates of Kane’s mansion loom ominously in the foreground and the camera cuts to a close-up of Kane’s mouth just as he utters his last word.</p>\n<p>After Kane dies, the scene cuts to a fast-paced newsreel with fully lit clips of the grand estate, headlines of Kane’s death flashing across the screen and a lively reporter narrating the businessman’s various accomplishments and failures. The stark difference between the two opening scenes provides a contrast between Kane’s personal life and his glorified memorial. Kane’s dark death scene demonstrates the internal troubles that plagued him, while the bright and unemotional newsreel right after represents the public view of Kane, with all his wealth and scandal on display.</p>\n<p>Another area of contrast is in the character of Kane himself, played by Orson Welles. Welles captures the happiness and sadness in Kane’s life with joyful, quick movements one minute and depressed sulking the next. As a young man, he stands tall and commands attention with a booming voice and wide smile. He turns his body quickly to look at everyone while giving an enthusiastic speech and dances with humorous glee after a big success.</p>\n<p>As the public icon grows older and more world-weary, his smile becomes a discomforted scowl and his voice lowers to terse gruffness. He shuffles slowly when he walks and wears a constant look of disappointment. This dramatic change in character reflects the changes that plague Kane’s life and led to his eventual failure.</p>\n<p>The camera work expertly focuses the audience’s attention and helps to demonstrate Kane’s struggle visually throughout the film. In scenes where a reporter is visiting various people for interviews, the reporter faces away from the camera or has his face obscured. This places the audience in the perspective of the reporter as though they are also a part of the action; on a mission to discover Kane’s secret.</p>\n<p>One of the last scenes elegantly illustrates Kane’s life and his true self as the camera pans over a sea of Kane’s possessions, representing all of his deeds, memories and wealth. The camera eventually zooms to focus on a single, nondescript item out of the entire collection, the item that was most important to Kane all along. Here, the camera work shows Kane’s personal value perfectly, proving that in the end, sometimes the simplest things are all that matter.</p>\n<p>“Citizen Kane” is not only a fascinating character study, but also a film that demonstrates the skill it takes to imbed every aspect with meaning and symbolism. From the shadowy lighting that creates an air of mystery, to the camera work that contrasts broad sets with intimate close ups to the acting that shows happiness deteriorating as life goes on, the film is engaging and eloquent, with the theme of memory present in every character and every scene. It’s not only for the film’s fame, but also for this theme of memory that made the film a natural choice for Magic Lantern’s 50th anniversary. What better way to celebrate the memory of cinema than with a film that proves just how important memories can be?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/","id":5893,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[5892,5891,5890],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hateful 8: Didn’t Hate, Wasn’t Great","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HATEFUL8.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HATEFUL8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Quentin Tarantino has always had trouble dialing it down for anyone, and this has usually been to cinematically fresh effect.

His films always revel in excess, often taking the form of the candy-coated violence of “Inglorious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.” “Kill Bill,” his most cartoonishly bloody film, had to be split into two releases due to its epic length. His latest work, “The Hateful Eight,” could have benefitted most from a similar sense of restraint.</p>\n<p>Set in post-Civil War America and starring a cast of killers and crooks portrayed by the talented likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern, the film fails to provide a story compelling enough for their enlivened performances to carry it for the three-hour runtime. It meanders through its first act, taking viewers along on a stagecoach ride bogged down by snow and an inconsiderate sense of pacing. As Jackson and Russell’s bounty hunters ride along with Leigh’s captured criminal and Goggins’s radically racist, so-called sheriff, they string along tales of their past deeds to flesh out their characters. Though it’s clear through their long-winded discourse that each of them maintains a suspicious distrust of the others, this sizeable chunk of the film is altogether not interesting enough to conjure up the tension it’s aiming for.</p>\n<p>The same can be said of the rest of the film’s first act, in which these four lodge up with the four other hatefuls to take shelter from an impending blizzard. The plot continues to trudge right up until the intermission, continuing to deal in shifty-eyed deceit and questionable, racially charged banter. The first bloodshed finally signals the ignition of the slow burn the film stokes throughout its first half, but the fire fails to light all that brightly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In its post-intermission devolution into a mess of desperation, death and violence, “The Hateful Eight” fails to find its footing. It channels Tarantino’s earliest work, “Reservoir Dogs,” in its conceit of criminals walled up together in a room killing each other one by one, but never achieves the raw tension of the older work. In “Reservoir Dogs,” tension is derived physically — an organic link formed between their mistrust and paranoia and the precise, powerful violence they inflict upon one another. This tension thus becomes palpable. In “The Hateful Eight,” the drama and violence are disjointed.</p>\n<p>The tension between the eight is based upon the duplicity between the characters. Everyone is lying to each other, and the audience just doesn’t quite know how, or to what ends. However, the film’s intense violence does not come as a result of this deceit but in addition to it, and thus its sophistication as cinematic currency is lost. The film revels in cringe and shock value to dubious effect, becoming an incessant bloodbath (even by Tarantino’s standards) without having earned the right to do so.</p>\n<p>This misestimation of his usual assets seems to stem from Tarantino’s hubris as a filmmaker. As evidenced by the above analyses and the film’s ostentatious runtime, we see an auteur so self-assured of his talent and worth that some editors must have been left underworked. Tarantino has refused to kill a single darling, and his audience is the one paying for it.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker’s big ambitions with “The Hateful Eight” did manage to pay off in one respect: the film’s “roadshow” presentation. Beginning with a five minute overture brandishing the scene-stealing score of legendary composer Ennio Morricone (“The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”) and split with a 12-minute intermission, the theater-going experience really did become an event. It was charming to peek back into the projector box to see the giant rolls of 70mm film, rendering the images on screen with such detail that small facets of wardrobe and setting became intricately involved with the movie in order to lend to its theatrical nature.</p>\n<p><em>“</em>The Hateful Eight” wraps itself in an intriguing presentation that can’t be matched by the presumptuous puttings-on of its plot. Toying with themes of duplicity, honesty and identity that never quite hit home, it allows itself to slip into violent spectacle for the sake of violence and spectacle. Quentin Tarantino’s eighth film, while certainly a cinematic experience, was not his best. Hopefully, the ninth will represent a return to form that does not betray its function.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67212\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/hateful-8-didnt-hate-wasnt-great/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67212\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/hateful-8-didnt-hate-wasnt-great/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/hateful-8-didnt-hate-wasnt-great/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/hateful-8-didnt-hate-wasnt-great/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/hateful-8-didnt-hate-wasnt-great/","id":5894,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[5893,5892,5891],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finding Home with Brooklyn","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brooklyn.jpg?resize=670%2C377&ssl=1","description":"Where is home? “Brooklyn” chronicles a young woman’s journey that is both literal and introspective.

After stepping out of Ellis Island’s customs checkpoint into a heavenly light, Saoirse Ronan’s Eilis Lacey must choose to commit herself to the possibilities of America or the familiarity of Ireland.</p>\n<p>The movie, set around 1952, exudes a sense of wonderment and melancholy, which I think is appropriate for a story about a young woman finding herself in a strange, new place. After Eilis’s sister Rose arranges for her to live in the colorful scene of Brooklyn, New York, she travels to America aboard a boat that seems hospitable until the waves start a-churnin’ and so does her dinner. Lacey arrives in Brooklyn as one of the many dozens of Irish folk trying to make their way in the world, whereupon she inhabits a boarding house populated by giggly yet helpful women and their amusingly terse housekeeper. Although New York is a lively escape from the quietude of shamrock country, Eilis finds herself tearful as she receives letters from home, reminding her of the life she left behind.</p>\n<p>After getting a job, she meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), an aspiring Italian plumber with whom she begins a relationship. After tragic events, she returns home and finds herself enamored with another gentleman caller played by Domhnall Gleeson, now hot off the success of Star Wars. Both of these characters represent their respective environments through their personalities, indirectly drawing Eilis to both sides of the pond.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Fiorello has attitude, ambition and exudes the possibilities of the hardworking American. He embodies a new, exciting life, but comes off as a little pushy, so it’s believable when Eilis considers his towering alternative. In contrast, Gleeson’s Jim Farrell is the more familiar option. He’s mannered yet charming, but reflects the life that Eilis was trying to get away from in the first place. Neither of them are perfect, but they are each believably enticing enough to give credence to Eilis’s hesitation. It’s a plot that’s pulled off far better than it ought to have been. Perhaps I’m just glad that there was no love triangle. I don’t care for those; it’s why “The Hunger Games” eventually lost me. Team I Don’t Give a Shit.</p>\n<p>But I digress. Considering Brooklyn’s narrative, it’s important to be able to both sympathize with the main character and reflect her turmoil in her performance. Saoirse Ronan pulled it off. She goes through a wide array of emotions and sells them: homesickness, despair, love, hope, and confidence. The best performances are the ones during which you look at a screen and see a character, not an actor trying to be that character. This is, of course, one of them. Give the Academy a call if you don’t believe me. Unless, of course, you’re also disgruntled on account of all the white Oscar nominees. In which case, tell Ronan yourself when she comes for SBIFF.</p>\n<p>Her emotional performance goes hand in hand with the film’s visual storytelling. The camera lingers on Ronan’s face for a prolonged moment as her character’s eyes dart around, showing us her confusion. We see a drawer of unopened letters sent from across the sea. The dim, wide beaches of Ireland stand out from the bright and crowded ones of Coney Island. With a “less is more” mindset, director John Crowley subtly puts us in Eilis’s thought process through such imagery, making the film that much more emotionally involving as we come witness to a woman’s growth as she has to answer the question, “where is home?” and an even harder question, “Am I happy?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would like to say that nothing is more awesome than an Irish brogue. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67628\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67628\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/finding-home-with-brooklyn/","id":5895,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5894,5893,5892],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
