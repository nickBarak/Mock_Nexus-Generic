Hankins worked at </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">El Gaucho </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first as a staff writer, then as an editor and managing editor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the spill, the culture at UCSB was ripe with passion, activism and fervor, said Hankins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a time of getting out of your chairs in a classroom,” he said. “Getting out in the field and doing something, seeing it, understanding it, studying it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students at UCSB were witnessing some of the most pivotal moments in the university’s history, including the Vietnam War protests, the civil rights protests, the unlawful arrests of Black Student Union members and the burning of the Bank of America Bank around a year after the spill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately after the start of the spill, students, teachers, activists and community members were galvanizing toward a new cause: the environmental protection movement.</span></p>\n<div

in a system of values that the university reflected – change that would include environmental education as a respected academia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It wasn’t the

It was coming from the students, the assistant professors, the people of the community who wondered why the campus couldn’t change to address these issues,” Nash said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their efforts lead to the implementation of an environmental studies department at UCSB, one of the first to appear in the country. The department brought together ideas from a range of academic fields and paved new paths for the discipline as a legitimate field of research and study.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB became a forefront of knowledge and scientific studies and expertise that helped give the environmental movement credibility,” Hankins said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nash became the first Chair of Environmental Studies in 1970, when the major was first established. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spill represented a major turning point in how local communities and the nation at large thought about and acted toward the environment, McGinnes said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, in the water miles off the coast of Santa Barbara, oil rigs still float solemnly in the distance.

They also warn residents to evacuate at any time if they feel unsafe and not to wait for an alert if they feel they are in danger.</p>\n<p>The rainfall Thursday morning has already caused heavy debris flow, according to Santa Barbara County First District Supervisor Das Williams.</p>\n<p>“The storm from this morning did bring down a lot of debris into our basins. Our crews are working overnight to clear it to make sure they are empty before this newest storm,” Williams said in a press release.</p>\n<p>“Please be aware of trucks coming down, hauling out this debris. It is critical that we get it out.”</p>\n<p>The National Weather Service forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rain for the coast and 4 to 7 inches in the mountains.</p>\n<p>The affected debris flow areas can be viewed at <a href=\"https://sbcoem.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2dfd558de56f45158b4f67ef678a24e3\">readysbc.org.</a></p>\n<p><em>Cristian Loza is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/35496e471f2e4c1433e55bf97b669e66?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/35496e471f2e4c1433e55bf97b669e66?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/cristian-loza/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Cristian Loza</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Cristian Loza is a reporter for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
