As Under Secretary, Grossman assembled diplomatic support for the U.S. after the September 11 attacks, and as U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan he supported the Afghan peace process and worked to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations.</p>\n<p>Grossman, who was born in Los Angeles, received a degree in political science from UCSB, and said one of his professors saw his potential after two years at the university.</p>\n<p>“He arranged for me to go on the Education Abroad Program,” Grossman said. “I’d never left the state of California before, and hours later we landed in London.”</p>\n<p>Grossman then got his master’s degree in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science before returning to Santa Barbara. Grossman said after returning and working in Santa Barbara for several years, he sought a career that would cater to his passion.</p>\n<p>“I came back to Santa Barbara, where I worked for three years — a year in politics and a couple years selling things door to door, which turned out to be great experience,” Grossman said. “One day I said to myself, I have got to find a profession that is going to pay me to live abroad and be curious about how other people live.”</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, he passed the Foreign Service exam at UCSB, then the oral exam at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, and in March of 1976 joined the Foreign Service and moved to the East Coast.</p>\n<p>Grossman said one of his biggest accomplishments during his time in the Foreign Service was working to dissuade the Turkish government from using torture when handling prisoners.</p>\n<p>“We were able to convince Turks that this kind of abuse — the systematic abuse of people — was just wrong,” Grossman said.</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, diplomacy is always changing, and he is excited to see college students majoring in fields like global studies and considering international careers.</p>\n<p>“The world is changing so fast, and these interactions are changing so fast,” Grossman said. “I teach to a lot of brand new American diplomats, and I envy them. They are really going to lead our engagement in the world for a very long time to come.”</p>\n<p>Grossman said students today are lucky to have more opportunities in the international field than he had when he started his career.</p>\n<p>“If you wanted to live that kind of life, diplomacy was basically the only way to do it,” Grossman said. “The choices that you all now have with non-governmental organizations, with charities, with multilateral organizations, with businesses, with more ways that people are today employed abroad, are very exciting prospects.”</p>\n<p>Grossman also said he hopes some students will consider a career in diplomacy for the United States.</p>\n<p>“I hope you really will consider representing the United States,” Grossman said. “There’s no substitute for working in an office where you have the American flag flying.”</p>\n<p>Global Studies Professor Eve Darian-Smith said Grossman gave students insight into a career path many global studies students are considering to pursue.</p>\n<p>“The visit from former Ambassador Marc Grossman was very exciting and granted our Global Studies students a glimpse into the life of a leading diplomat working at the frontlines of U.S. foreign policy in extremely difficult political contexts,” Darian-Smith said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Edixon Puglisi said it is important that those who are “experts of their craft” convey their experiences to students.</p>\n<p>“It is very important to pass down to new generations the keys to success in each field of study, as well as the experiences of success and failure in each field, in such a way so that we may learn from our mistakes and become more efficient and effective individuals in society,” Puglisi said.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Harrison Marshall said listening Grossman’s talk actually helped him finalize his decision to apply to work for the U.S.</p>\n<p>“For me personally it gave me a lot of perspective on what I want to be pursuing with my life,” Marshall said. “Because of the visit I’m most definitely going to be applying for the State, which is something I had only considered before.”</p>\n<p>According to Darian-Smith, the Q&amp;A session following Grossman’s talk gave many students insight into the nuances of a career in foreign diplomacy.</p>\n<p>“It was a unique opportunity for students to ask the Ambassador direct questions, which he answered with candor, grace and humor,” Darian-Smith said. “Students’ minds were opened up to the contradictions and unpredictability of navigating foreign relations across different cultures, religions and worldviews, and the visit provided an invaluable ‘real-life’ teaching moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to Riley’s Facebook and Twitter posts, this caused university staff and faculty, including Black Studies professor Gaye Theresa Johnson, to reverse the decision and allow The Coup to perform.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead said The Coup had difficulty with the university’s insurance policy because campuswide insurance carrier Campus Connexxus does not provide coverage for hip hop artists. According to Armistead, hip-hop artists in the past have been able to perform because they had their own insurance, but The Coup did not.</p>\n<p>“The insurance carrier does not provide coverage for hip-hop,” Armistead said in an email. “When this is the case, the artists that want to come to campus must supply their insurance coverage. The Coup does not have its own insurance.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said the MCC’s request that the insurance requirement be waived so The Coup could play was originally denied, but that she then worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to get the requirement waived.</p>\n<p>“When I learned that a waiver was denied I worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to correct the decision,” Armistead said in an email. “Once it was deemed that there was no security issue with the group coming to campus, the decision to not waive the insurance requirement was reversed. So, the show will go on.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said while she was able to help get the insurance waived within 24 hours, the outbreak on social media created a “storm.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59865\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59865\" data-attachment-id=\"59865\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/concert-almost-canceled-over-insurance-concerns/mcc_file-photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"11\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1398169298\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MCC/Entrance_File Photo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59865\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo-1024x682.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"MCC/Entrance_File Photo\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">View of the outside of the MultiCultural Center building on campus. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>“The issue was corrected within 24 hours of the original decision,” Armistead said. “Unfortunately, the social media storm started while we were already working on the issue.”</p>\n<p>KCSB Development Coordinator Ted Coe said it was odd that the university would not provide insurance to The Coup for playing hip hop music.</p>\n<p>“It’s like there is a certain artistic expression, but then you’re told that expression isn’t welcome on campus,” Coe said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics and mathematics major George Purtell said he was disappointed to hear The Coup might not be able to play on campus this Friday.</p>\n<p>“The Coup is always playing on my iPod,” Purtell said. “I was looking forward to seeing them, but when I saw Boots Riley’s post on Facebook, I was definitely disappointed with the university.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Purtell said he was glad the insurance requirement was eventually waived and that the university is now allowing The Coup to play their upcoming show.</span></p>\n<p>“I was definitely relieved to hear that it all worked out in the end,” Purtell said. “I will be the first one there to see them on Friday night.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Listen to The Coup on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ5hD-fpksO0-7xLoBq3lTw\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> or <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/artist/4IvS1ZZ5nyiNMheybfx3Hf\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into underground rock in order to force it open and extract oil or gas. Mason specializes in Environmental and Resource Economics and is an associate editor of the <em>European Economic Review</em>, co-editor of the <em>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists</em> and joint editor-in-chief of <em>Strategic Behavior in the Environment.</em></p>\n<p>Mason began his lecture by addressing the economic advantages behind fracking such as increased employment from fracking-related jobs as well as an increase in the supply of natural gas for consumers worldwide.</p>\n<p>“With this kind of expansion in production you have a large increase in supply,” Mason said. “That generally means two things to people who use natural gas — greater ability and lower prices. This is the kind of thing that politicians would naturally glom onto.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, another advantage brought on by fracking includes a decrease in carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>“This big increase in the production of natural gas has lead to a displacement of coal as a source for producing electricity, which in turn means a reduction of carbon emissions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>However, Mason said the potential water contamination caused by hydraulic reinjection is a major concern regarding fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“A particular amount of the angst about fracking, I think, has to do with the potential for groundwater contamination,” Mason said. “The contaminated water that comes from the frack job is the larger consideration.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61006\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61006\" data-attachment-id=\"61006\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/prof-discusses-pros-cons-of-fracking/mason-fracking-talk_paris-cullen-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=2567%2C3470&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2567,3470\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424178408\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"36\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mason Fracking Talk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=758%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61006\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2-758x1024.jpg?resize=350%2C473\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=758%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 758w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1 185w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Mason, research on the exact environmental costs of fracking has been hindered by the incomplete record keeping on the part of natural gas companies.</p>\n<p>“Until relatively recently, there was considerable lack of transparency about what was being done,” Mason said. “We don’t know what’s in the chemical compounds that are being used as part of the frack job, we don’t know how dangerous it is … we don’t know whether or not we should worry about this getting into our groundwater.”</p>\n<p>Mason also said his research on water contamination, which is his focus regarding his studies on fracking in Sublette County, Wyoming, has shown him the extent of companies’ inadequacy in reporting fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“There’s asymmetric information,” Mason said. “The firms that are undertaking these jobs know exactly what they’re injecting, but we know nothing.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, he uses company reports to research the consequences of fracking, and his findings have shown that some potentially toxic ingredients of the fracking process are left out as “trade secrets.”</p>\n<p>“They do have specific information of the ingredients that were used, subject to trade secrets exceptions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>First-year student in the Bren School master’s program Leah Fine said Mason’s lecture reinforced material she has learned in her environmental policy classes.</p>\n<p>“Especially since being at Bren, I’ve become more interested in the production of groundwater resources,” Fine said. “It was a cool tie-in with some of the curriculum here at the Bren School, and I thought it was really interesting to hear how different companies disclose information.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year student in the Bren School master’s program Hye Min Park, it was useful to hear about the practical applications of fracking outside of the classroom.</p>\n<p>“This is a really specific issue that I don’t always get to learn about in lectures,” Park said, “I thought it was really interesting to see how it is applied in the real world.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

said the shooting is a manifestation of recent Islamophobic sentiments in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“This comes at a time when Islamophobia had become all too clear in the way conversations are held and how the media reports the news,” Jishi said.</p>\n<p>According to Jishi, the incident highlights discriminatory treatment of Muslims purported by some mass media outlets.</p>\n<p>“A Muslim-American Human Rights lawyer was asked on CNN whether he supported ISIS,” Jishi said. “This creates an atmosphere where hatred towards Muslims can become prevalent for no other reason than the God they worship or the attire they choose.”</p>\n<p>Jishi also said the MSA views the three students “as our brothers and sisters in faith,” and that the candlelight vigil aimed to bring attention to the Islamophobic sentiment that pervades even college campuses.</p>\n<p>Whitney Triplett, a third-year psychology major who attended the event, said the vigil helped create a space in which students could be informed about what happened in Chapel Hill as well as be supportive of the victim’s families.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for these types of stories to get out and be made public,” Triplett said. “It’s important to come out and make a statement and let these peoples’ families know that even from here in California we mourn with them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biochemistry major Yasmin Sallak said students living in Isla Vista last Spring can relate the incident at Chapel Hill.</p>\n<p>“Here at UCSB we know what it’s like to lose students,” Sallak said.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman from Santa Barbara Hillel was present at the vigil and said he attended in order to mourn with a fellow religious community on campus.</p>\n<p>“I’m very sensitive to both the trauma of these kind of horrible murders at a college campus,” Goodman said. “Especially when it involves a religious community.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, solidarity among religious communities is especially vital in the midst of instances of hate crime.</p>\n<p>“If there was even a hint of this being a bias or hate crime then we need to stand together,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_60874\" style=\"width: 610px\"
