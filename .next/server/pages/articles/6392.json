Because it would make perfect sense for you to fall in love with your hookup’s roommate. Talk about a classic mix-up.</p>\n<p>Have you ever woken up after a night of (self-proclaimed) “slay city” and looked across the room only to find the most beautiful Lamb of God imaginable lying in the other bed? I know what you’re thinking in that situation, and I’m right there with ya. Yeah, shit son, you went for the wrong roommate. Now? Welcome to the hardest phase of time management you’ll face in your entire college career: swiftly making the transition from roommate number one to roommate number two.</p>\n<p>Upon first meeting each other, you and roommate number two overlook the, “Duhhhhhh, what’s your major?” bullshit, because you very clearly can’t have each other. Cordial schmordial. But, regardless, there’s instant attraction, and before you know it, outta nowhere, it turns into need it, want it, gotta have it. The attraction is mutual, because hello, it makes perfect sense. It’s like solving a Rubik’s Cube — shit finally lines up and then you suddenly can’t suppress the desire to completely fuck it up again. But anywho, I digress.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The worst part is when you actually succeed in hooking up with roommate number two. Because, inevitably, you’ll get caught. It’s always this drawn-out, painfully elaborate process that starts out innocently with roommate number one coming over to your house and asking where you bought these “specialty” condoms. Your casual reply of “Pshh, I bought them” is the last nail in the coffin. Turns out they’re these super fuckin’ rare, can-only-get-them-in-China, heavy-duty, keep-the-babies-AWAY condoms. To which you try to immediately recover with, “Uh, ya. Haha. Ha. Funny story, true story, actually, they started selling them at I.V. Market, who knew right? WHO KNEW?”</p>\n<p>But I mean, once things start moving past the classic OTPHJ (over the pants hand job) stage, it starts becoming, “Listen, my roommate is in class, get your ass over here, NOW.” And then you’re free to bang, and not just bang, puhlease. Forget hearing your standard cup caking through the wall. Ha, child’s play. We’re talking hearing-long-distance-headboard-banging-against-the-wall status. Heyo, ‘sup world.</p>\n<p>You think you’re so suave in keeping it on the major down low. But then shit starts getting all kinds of uncomfortable. In front of roommate number one, you casually mention to roommate number two that they should “draw you,” and it’s like, “Oh, God, not actually. I meant the app!” But even Draw Something wants you to be together. Every three coin word is soulmate … or marriage … or skeeball … okay that was a wild card, but all you want is that goddamn neon color package, so you have to pick them. God. Life is hard.</p>\n<p>And then, despite all this, roommate number one is still way too confident in the hookup relationship, because they somehow remain incredibly oblivious, when everyone at UCSB (including Chancellor Yang) has caught onto what is going on. So number one starts shit-talking to number two. “Hey, bro, I’m wearing Velcro shoes and still getting laid while you go home and beat it tonight.” And all the while, roomie number two is thinking, “Uh, yeah, to the nudes your girlfriend sent me last night. Yeah, yeah, later bro.”</p>\n<p>Then, when all three of you are in public together, the two of you secret lovahs get close enough to start passionately making out, but end up high-fiving instead. ‘Cause as much as you want to finally expose the relationship, it’s like, what are you supposed to say at this point? “I accidentally slipped it in?” Yeah, and I “accidentally” parked my car in my neighbor’s garage … claaaassic me.</p>\n<p>But the real turning point is when they start to make you think all kinds of crazy shit. Like, woah, I would even watch American Idol for this person. Holy shit, I might even go so far as to pick a favorite and start arguing with the judges. No. No way, this is not real life.</p>\n<p>Once that happens, you’re done for. You’ve committed and that only means that roommate number one is bound to walk into your classic afternoon delight sesh. And while you try to chalk it up to “just hanging out,” we all saw the girl’s tongue moving around like she was searching for the straw in her fourth Long Island Iced Tea.</p>\n<p>Just, ya know, go for it, but tread lightly. This isn’t a Disney movie for Christ’s sake. Get real. We all saw how fast Snow White ditched those seven dwarfs after Prince Charming finally gave it up.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks is biding time until she realizes her own roommate took her column to heart.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Natalie O” align=”aligncenter” width=”1024″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/devil_room-mate1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1705699728\" data-slb-group=\"45789\"><img data-attachment-id=\"45792\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/roommate-doubledouble-careful-appetite-takes/devil_room-mate-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/devil_room-mate1.jpg?fit=1558%2C313&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1558,313\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"devil_room mate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/devil_room-mate1.jpg?fit=250%2C50&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/devil_room-mate1.jpg?fit=888%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-45792\" title=\"devil_room mate\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/devil_room-mate1-1024x205.jpg?resize=888%2C178\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"178\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/roommate-doubledouble-careful-appetite-takes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/roommate-doubledouble-careful-appetite-takes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/roommate-doubledouble-careful-appetite-takes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/roommate-doubledouble-careful-appetite-takes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/roommate-doubledouble-careful-appetite-takes/","id":6392,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6391,6390,6389],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks","biography":"Not available","articles":[6391,6392,6415,6417,6418,6420,6421,6422,6425,6426,6427,6428,6429],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Case Cracked: Casual Coitus on College Campuses","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sexlesswhite-e1556772765124.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sexlesswhite-e1556772765124.png?resize=650%2C622&ssl=1","description":"Marie Stevenson examines college student's views on casual sex.

The message behind having free condoms readily available is essentially a reminder to be safe, an acknowledgement that sex will probably take place so it’s best to be prepared for it. At the beginning of  fall quarter, I saw free condoms being put out, along with tampons and pads. I observed that contraceptives and feminine products were being categorized together, implying some degree of transferability regarding their necessity. This is something I disagree with. You cannot will your period to stop, as awesome as that would be, but (in a perfect world) you can choose whether or not you’d like to have sex.  My discomfort, of course, does not translate into support for any sort of regulation, policing or actions that should be taken. I look back now and see the right to participate freely and explore your sexual identity as something that years of sexual liberation, progress and technological innovation has brought to us. I do however, disagree with the conflation of what I see as cultural pressure to participate in casual sex with being liberated, progressive and “woke.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though feminism and the detachment of sex from traditional stigmas may appear to inevitably support casual sex, that does not mean it is necessarily emotionally healthy.

From a young age, my perception of casual sex was colored by this study. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I saw college parties as a setting for these non-inclusive, hyperheterosexual, primal activities. Also, being in a long-term relationship and coming into this campus as a first-year, I observed the active party culture going on around me. Drawing from my preconceptions I felt skeptical and hesitant to embrace that culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to numbers, my caricatured idea of college life may be incorrect. From a </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12930\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40-year study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted between 1976 and 2016 on 18 million teenagers, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">54% of high school students in 1991 reported having had sex, while only 41% did in the early 2010s.  This study even suggests that “today’s 18-year-old more closely resembles a 15-year-old of the 1970s or ’80s.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So even though it may feel like everyone around me is “doing the deed” 24/7, we are actually participating in less sex than older generations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the reasoning behind this? Perhaps there are more romantics among us today who feel as I do and are more likely to give it some time. Or maybe people are generally less interested in dating earlier on. Or it may be that the definition of sex and intimacy has changed. It ultimately boils down to several factors, the center of it all being technology.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has changed the game. Sexting, snapchat sex, porn and all the resources the internet has to offer have joined forces to </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/6-ways-sex-is-different-between-gen-z-millennials-according-to-a-survey-16924538\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divert teens’ focus from physical sex to online sex.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At the same time, technological advances and more resources mean that each generation is living longer, so having sex later on in your life may be a symptom of the “slow-life strategy,” discussed in the </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12930\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mentioned above. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the study, this phenomenon fits into a larger trend of kids staying kids longer due to lengthened lifespans and </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-sex-alcohol-driving-study-2017-9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more present parental supervision</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today’s teens were found to be less likely to drive, work for pay, go on dates, have sex, or go out without their parents.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has affected sex in other ways. With so much to do on social media and streaming services, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z-sex-alcohol-driving-study-2017-9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more people prefer to stay in and use devices </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">instead of, say, go out to do drugs, drink alcohol and find partners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though statistics support this view of people our age, our campus appears to oppose the general data about Gen Z’s sexual habits. Could the reputation of UCSB’s social life create a concentration of people more interested in sex, alcohol and drugs, thereby exempting this population from a generalized claim? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be an interesting thing to think about, but in the end it should not affect the way you go about your life. I may have had my preconceived notions about casual sex and even taken a moral stance on it back then, but the fact is that sex is just one of the many choices at your disposal as a young adult, and as long as you’re informed and consent to it, it can be fun. Just stay safe out there.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marie Stevenson wants Gauchos to weigh the risks and rewards of sexual activity.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87891\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87891\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/case-cracked-casual-coitus-on-college-campuses/","id":6389,"author":{"id":789,"name":"Marie Stevenson"},"related":[6388,6387,6386],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Newbie’s Guide to Threesomes","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Three-somes-daily-nexus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Three-somes-daily-nexus.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"An anonymous gaucho shares the secrets for having a successful threesome.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In pursuit of just a smidgen of coochie, I agonize through super awkward moments of trying to put myself out there in my classes, social gatherings, jobs and extracurricular activities.

I’ve seen friends agree to threesomes at the insisting of their significant other, only to back out at the last minute because they were never really comfortable with having a threesome to begin with. Even if everyone’s sexual orientations and attractions align, people’s relationship status, gender, sexual orientation or anything else can play a role in the power they have over the other parties. Being conscious of that not only allows everyone to feel respected but also leads to better sex, because everyone is fully into the sexcapades that will take place without even unintentional persuasion.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Threesomes don’t usually go down the way they do in porn</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One hilariously disastrous night, a friend and I met up with an acquaintance and ended up deciding to go back to his place. My friend and I were both quite attracted to each other and to him, so we decided to get down and dirty. Although, admittedly, there were definitely some warning signs we should have picked up on, we were caught off guard when halfway through he asked us to “suck his dick together.” Immediately, my friend and I looked at each other, laughed and said, “Sorry, but we have to go now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, the mechanics of a double-dick sucking seem awkward and not as pleasurable as the fantasy of it is. Secondly, we realized that he had no desire to engage with us in this real, sexy, enjoyable experience, and instead he wanted to recreate his idea of a threesome. I didn’t feel like I was being treated like a person and an active equal participant in this sexual encounter. It’s hard to blame him, however, with flashy porn titles like “Her Boyfriend’s Cock in Another Girl’s Pussy” and “Stepsisters Share Big Dick” shown on the first page of Pornhub.com. Popular culture and movies only reinforce the stereotype that threesomes are an exclusively heterosexual cis-male fantasy. However, they don’t have to be. If you throw out these images and go into the encounter wanting to simply explore and experience being with two bodies, you can see how rewarding the experience can truly be. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Beware of having threesomes with couples*</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This tip comes with an asterisk. I and many others have had great experiences having threesomes with a couple. Some couples view threesomes as a way to feel closer to each other because they’re having a new sexual experience together. I’ve also found being the “unicorn” to be very sexually rewarding, as both members of the couple often focused on my sexual wantings more. Since they had slept together before, exploring my body was newer and more exciting for them, and my body became the center of attention. However, jealousy and cheating are two major issues that can come into play, especially with couples. Several of my friends have had their partners use threesomes as a way to start cheating on them. Even if the power in threesomes isn’t used to hurt people, there is an inherent jealousy that many people feel when they watch their partner enjoy having sex with someone else. Hence the asterisk.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>All three parties involved must be prepared for the emotional consequences</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the dynamics of a romantic relationship don’t come into play, fucking your friends may change the relationships you’ve established. It’s a good idea to have some clarity on what everyone wants to get out of the threesome </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preferably before the sexy time starts. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Threesome:</span></em></p>\n<p><b>COMMUNICATION IS KEY</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with pretty much any time you swap bodily fluids with someone (or several someones), communicating during the act makes everything go more smoothly. There are three bodies involved instead of just two, and that can be pretty awkward unless you’re comfortable communicating what you want to the other two people with you. Properly communicating can also alleviate feelings of performance anxiety, insecurity or jealousy, as it allows everyone to feel on the same page during this intimate act. </span></p>\n<p><b>Threesomes should not just be two people having sex and then switching off</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody wants to feel left out, and especially during a threesome, every partner should feel like they’re playing an active role in the sexual activities. Often people go into their first threesome and expect that it will mirror the way they have sex with one other person. The beauty of threesomes is that it can be a completely new experience than just having sex with one person and then switching to focus on the other person. Lots of sexual positions can facilitate everyone getting involved, depending on which sex acts people agree to participate in. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the Threesome:</span></em></p>\n<p><b>Check in</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the sex itself is amazing and everyone enjoyed it, there are lingering feelings that creep up after the fact. Checking in on the days that follow can help settle those feelings in a constructive way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this guide is nowhere near as comprehensive nor specific as to how a threesome might happen for you, it is a step toward normalizing threesomes and having them seen as a thrilling way to connect with more than one person. Threesomes have been demonized, often for women, as a shameful act that only those who don’t respect themselves would do. For men, they’re seen as the height of sexual prowess — the most sought-after sexual encounter. For queer people, especially non-binary people, threesomes are represented in ways that are heteronormative and cisgendered, which causes people to enter these situations with inaccurate expectations. It doesn’t have to be that way! Now that you have some idea of what to expect, go out there and unabashedly enjoy hooking up with as many consenting partners as your heart desires. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This anonymous Gaucho wants to get real about staying kinky in I.V.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/a-newbies-guide-to-threesomes/","id":6390,"author":{"id":785,"name":"Anonymous Gaucho"},"related":[6389,6388,6387],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I Never Tell a Lie, Except for Those Times When I Do","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The average person tells seven lies a day.

I’m not sure if I read that from a Snapple fact or if I just made that up. But anyway, I didn’t believe it at first, until I started listening to half the shit I say. And turns out, it’s probably right. And I’m likely above average.</p>\n<p>Sometimes lying is fun, but almost always, lying makes you seem a hell of a lot cooler than you really are. Well, that is, until you get caught.</p>\n<p>1. The Athlete: Everyone loves an athlete. It’s a completely forgivable category. You can be a douchebag, closet weirdo or have the IQ of a donkey, but as long as you have the jersey, you’re a fuckin’ stud. But even if you have the makeup of an athlete (chiseled bod, that stupid ass arrogance for no reason at all and excessive grab-ass behavior — regardless of gender), you’ve got nothin’ if you peaked in high school. So while you’re talkin’ to Miss Dick-Sucking-Lips on the couch, you might have to throw a curveball. “Yeah, I’m on the basketball team, it’s really no big deal.” And as she scoots close enough to you to potentially perform a ballcuzi, you choke. “I mean, I’m on the I.M. team, but it’s cool. We won our bracket. You’re still going home with me, right?” Don’t be surprised if she retaliates with, “Let’s put it this way, does a priest make a good babysitter?” (Sorry, too close to Easter; brb going to hell.)</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2. The Virgin: Although it’s hard to believe that a) this rare breed exists in Isla Vista and b) they’d be willing to give it up the same night that they met you, you can’t beat this one if you play it off right. Disclaimer: If you don’t, you’ll end up beating it yourself. Meeting a virgin is like entering into the apocalypse. No matter how much you think you’re prepared, you’re still fucked. Wading through the excitement and ego boost, you all of a sudden land on the holy shit freak out that this person is about to remember you forever. But, then, of course, once you’re actually in bed, they start bending like a yoga teacher, hanging upside down from their sex swing, throwing out moves you’ve only seen on T.V. programs. And I’m talkin’ the expensive ones.</p>\n<p>3. The Writer: This one has so many different angles to work with. If you’re a guy, you look sentimental and smart, and if you’re a girl, well, likely you’re smart enough to steal my thunder and play off that you’re Elizabeth Brooks. Clothes come off, and if you’re real wild, sheets may come off too, and then all of a sudden you’re like, “Fuck. What did I just get myself into here? Did I just inadvertently sign up for a Dirty Sanchez? I should’ve done my research on my fake job. Shit.” Well, word to the wise, be prepared for my new favorite question, “Oh my God, are you going to write about this?” Why, yes. Yes I am. It’s on like Groupon.</p>\n<p>4. The Slayer: There’s a fine line between creepy and crafty. Make enough sexual innuendos: crafty. Walk into Jack in the Box in the nude and throw open your robe: creepy. But sometimes, if your little innuendos come off too strong, you might as well start investing in a cheap cotton robe. Talking a big game is lying’s sneaky, twatty sister that no one invited. If you have no intention of following through, you’re just a classic cock-tease, or, you’re in too deep. While you’re jammin’ at a party to “Club Can’t Handle Me” (because enough time has passed for it to be okay to get excited about this song again), you might want to hold back on the, “Yeah, well, if the club can’t handle you, I bet your bottom fuckin’ dollar my hotel room can,” unless you have Gold Cab’s number on speed dial. It comes down to two choices: run, or rail and bail. If you’re gonna lie, you gotta commit.</p>\n<p>5. The Magician: This is one you don’t see very often, unless you’re into David Blaine — or some magical panty dropper effect that I’m unaware of — but mostly just David Blaine. And while it seems far-fetched, and probably some level of just plain uncool to pretend to be a magician, think about what it would be like to encounter one. You’d start out like, “Yeah, sweet, other than pulling a Houdini and blowing a load in a girl’s face, what other little ‘magic’ do you have?” But what if they were a real magician? You might find out what the fuck actually happens when they saw someone in half. Think of all of the secrets you would finally have answers to! Maybe you could join in on one of the acts, hit the road and end up in Vegas. Oh, the possibilities. Just make sure you at least have the abraca-chicken one down before you go big.</p>\n<p>Deceiving someone to get them into bed is just plain cruel. But “I love you,” “I’ll pull out” or “I’m on the pill” are all a little too overused to be taken seriously. So get creative.
