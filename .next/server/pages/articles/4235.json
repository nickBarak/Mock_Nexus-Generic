For 50 cents, customers can add hemp seed milk, almond milk or wildflower honey.</p>\n<p>All orders come with cane sugar and half &amp; half cream and customers who provide their own mug will receive 50 cents off.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks sources its beans directly from farmers Trump has personally engaged with while working on coffee plantations in Central America. Beans from countries such as Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and many others, have already made their way into the mugs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>Quality is the paramount aspect of Coffee Organiks and often a characteristic that is hard to come by in the coffee served in Isla Vista, said Trump.</p>\n<p>“[In I.V.] I don’t think there is anyone out there that can beat the quality of our coffee,” he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks’ first round of deliveries brewed more demand than expected. Trump noted in a Facebook post that the Peruvian blend sold out in a matter of three days.</p>\n<p>In addition to his Central American coffee blends, Trump is also looking to impress the caffeine-cravers of Isla Vista by securing an agreement with a chef in New York to expand Coffee Organiks’ menu to include domestic flavors as well.</p>\n<p>Trump has faith Coffee Organiks will continue to satisfy I.V.’s palate, adding they are “flirting with the idea of a coffee subscription” which would allow customers to have coffee delivered every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis for a discounted price.</p>\n<p>Also in the works along is an app, which would allow users to order coffee through their phones, he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks is not Trump’s first experience in caffeinated enterprises.</p>\n<p>Trump’s first introduction to the coffee industry was during a trip to Central America in 2012. During his time in Atenas, Costa Rica, Trump gained knowledge about the process of producing coffee beans while working at a coffee plantation owned by the Carlos family, a family he continues to source beans from for Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“I grew a stronger passion once I started working on the coffee fields,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>After returning to California to work as a chef for Google, Trump had a casual conversation about coffee with his roommates, which, after some experimentation and taste-testing, ushered the idea of a coffee delivery service into fruition.</p>\n<p>Trump came to UCSB after he was offered a scholarship in molecular biology. After only a year of being a Gaucho, he officially launched Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“Nothing is better than someone who takes a sip of our coffee and is immediately in a better mood,” Trump said when asked about his favorite part of the process.</p>\n<p>All products from Coffee Organiks are brewed in a sanitized kitchen under a food handler’s license.</p>\n<p>Orders can be placed at Coffee Organiks’ Instagram @Coffeeorganiks or on the company’s Facebook.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Now, this experience from her college years is just one of the reasons she changed her mind about the profession and decided to pursue a career in police work.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing how well you remember that and then you can’t remember what you had for dinner last night,” Avila said, adding that she still remembers the name of the officer whom she accompanied.</p>\n<p>Now, a decade later and recently named the first interpersonal violence investigator for Isla Vista, Avila brims with enthusiasm for her position and the community she works in.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and the UC Police Department <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">created the position</a> in late November. A contract signed by the two allocates funding to a peace officer designated to investigate crimes such as stalking, domestic abuse and sexual violence both on campus and in I.V. with the latter previously falling to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Avila has spent almost four years working at UCPD when she was hired in 2014 after working at Guadalupe Police Department.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman at Guadalupe PD for some time, Avila was often assigned delicate cases, such as child sex crimes, through which she began practicing some of the skills needed for handling interpersonal violence cases.</p>\n<p>Avila’s training also includes courses on numerous subjects, including human trafficking in minors, sexual assault, trauma interviewing and a drug endangered children course.</p>\n<p>Being a mother and a “people person” are qualities that Avila cites as making herself a qualified and strong investigator for Isla Vista, though she acknowledges that sometimes her passion for helping survivors can be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I think I care too much. I get really attached to my survivors. I get really empathetic about their situation,” Avila said. “People might agree or disagree but I think that is a strength of mine.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of her position, Avila hopes to build trust between her and individual survivors as well as the general community of I.V. through community outreach, attending meetings and dispersing information about interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“I think in general when we humanize the form and the badge and the officer, that barrier diminishes a bit and people are more open to come up to us and inform us of things,” she said.</p>\n<p>The implementation of a police officer dedicated wholley to processing interpersonal violence cases is a victory to several groups and individuals in the community, such as Briana Conway [[ok]], director of Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.), and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</p>\n<p>Relationships between survivor advocacy groups like C.A.R.E. and STESA with UCPD are crucial for informing survivors of their options with cases and facilitating difficult processes involved in case investigation, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>“When an advocate and law enforcement have a really smooth working relation, the likelihood that a survivor’s going to want to stay in that process is greatly increased,” she said.</p>\n<p>The position of the interpersonal violence investigator fills some of the “holes” that existed in the previous processes for handling interpersonal violence cases, Conway said.</p>\n<p>Efforts to solve cases are now more streamlined, reducing the number of times survivors have to tell their stories. Cases are also less likely to slip through the hands of officers who often have other cases that take higher priority.</p>\n<p>“To be able to have that compassionate connection to at least explain the legal process from their expertise could just be really helpful in the [survivor’s] decision-making process as well,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway has worked with Avila since she began at UCPD and describes her as an “incredibly kind and patient” officer.</p>\n<p>“I can say wholeheartedly, from how she treats survivors, [her work is] remarkable and wonderful, and survivors are in a much better place getting to speak to someone like her,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Despite her qualifications and support from community members, Avila acknowledges there are personal challenges that lie ahead in her demanding position. Being what she calls a “feeler,” Avila knows the realities of her job and her attachment to survivors takes a toll on her emotional health at times. She admits she sometimes cries about her cases.</p>\n<p>“You have to remember to exercise, spend time with my family and not get depressed because people are counting on me. My survivors are counting on me,” Avila said.</p>\n<p>After particularly difficult days, during the hour-long drive Avila makes from I.V. during the week, she listens to music, de-stresses from work and enjoys the scenic route back home.</p>\n<p>For Avila, it’s the small things that go a long way and make her passionate about her job. “Thank yous” and smiles are things she receives from survivors that are particularly rewarding.</p>\n<p><i>Jessica Reincke contributed reporting.</i></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Nov. 28, 7:21 p.m.]: Avila’s training included a drug endangered children course, not a “drug and danger children course,” as stated in a previous version of this article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Biko Garage held a voting information night on Monday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The infonight focused specifically on the statewide ballot propositions. Event organizers provided students with the overview, background, pros, cons and endorsements of Proposition 1 through Proposition 12, excluding Proposition 9.</p>\n<p>Proposition 9 was<a href=\"https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/prop-9-supreme-court-ruling.pdf\"> removed from the ballot</a> in July by the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Rain Kahsu, organizer of the Biko Voting Infonight and fourth-year political science student, said she wanted to hold this event after speaking to her housemates about the election and realizing that “we were all freaking out.”</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to have an event where I could be with members of the community and my friends and just talk about this kind of stuff that’s kind of scary. There’s so much information,” Kahsu said.</p>\n<p>Approximately 20 people attended and discussed each proposition, asking questions about the issues, providing clarifications and offering personal opinions.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the propositions discussed was Proposition 8, which would limit the amount of money kidney dialysis clinics could charge for treatment.</p>\n<p>As with the other propositions, organizers went over the pros and cons, stating that clinics would be prevented from treating patients differently based on what type of insurance they have, so the proposition could result in the closure of “many” California dialysis clinics.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had their phones out throughout the event, googling specific proposition language and facts to aid the conversation.</p>\n<p>At one point, an attendee frustrated with the complex and vague language of the propositions exclaimed, “Why is it so difficult to fucking vote?”</p>\n<p>While the remark was met with laughs, the sentiment was echoed by several students at the event.</p>\n<p>Kahsu hoped students attending the event would come and “gain information they didn’t know and be able to ask questions” and “be able to talk about how they’re going to vote or things they’ve heard.”</p>\n<p>For fourth-year global studies major Naima Sudjian-Carlisle, Monday’s event was an opportunity to be involved with a community event where students could learn from each other.</p>\n<p>“I procrastinated in researching what’s on the ballot, what people to vote for and everything like that,” Sudjian-Carlisle said. “I was really glad to hear different perspectives on propositions. I’m now informed for voting tomorrow, but I still want to do some research tonight.”</p>\n<p>Other attendees agreed that it was helpful to get together with community members to talk about the ballot before voting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“The proposition language can be really confusing, so it’s helpful to just be in a group with other people and go through them to kind of pick them apart to see what is actually the intention of each proposition,” said Solmaz Soleimani, a UCSB Class of 2018 graduate.</p>\n<p>Kat Ghodoosian, a third-year political science student, emphasized the importance of being an informed voter. She said the event helped her “get more of a nuanced perspective.”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s one thing to go out and register and vote, but it’s another thing to be an informed voter,” Ghodoosian said. “UCSB students should feel responsible not only to be registered and to go out to the polls, but they should also be responsible for knowing what’s on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>Attendees left the event around 6:30 p.m., with several promising to post their further research on the propositions on the Biko Garage Facebook page before the election the next day.</p>\n<p>Kahsu was optimistic about how the info night had gone, stating she hoped attendees were able to walk away “a little more informed and a little less anxious.”</p>\n<p>“Vote and, even more than that, try to be more engaged in politics and with your community,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.
