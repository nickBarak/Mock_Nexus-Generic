Her music acts as an escape route from the heavily engineered hits that dominate the pop music landscape. The Steve Lacy-produced </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crush </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EP catalogues Lenae’s reflective experiences, from that of the suppression of romance to the inherent fear of commitment in the confines of a modern dating era, where short attention spans lead to the demise of a relationship. Lenae’s compelling persona throughout her discography permeates into her live shows, where she becomes a celestial wave of R&amp;B and soul. On Wednesday, Lenae commanded the crowd with glittery performances about unattainable crushes at The Hub for a show sponsored by A.S. Program Board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nineteen-year-old Lenae has cracked open the matrix of writing intricate storylines about unreciprocated sentiments and bottled feelings for an online romance. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us are mortified by our 19-year-old writing efforts, whether they be in song format, diary entries or essays dealing with the psychology of online dating. Lenae flips the mediocrity of our teenage achievements on its head; she exceeds a maturity that resemble prodigal endeavors. The 16-minute EP is a compilation of Lenae’s powerful vocal artistry and Lacy’s changing groove. Lenae’s breezy riffs are emblematic of what Lionel Richie would describe as “easy as Sunday morning.” The cross-pollination of Lenae’s vocals and Lacy’s guitar plucking conjures the feeling of sunshine on your face. Lenae receives praise from fellow multi-talented songstresses SZA and Noname, so much so that Lenae was brought as an opening act for both of the artists’ tours.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85098\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1179597791\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85096\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85098\" data-attachment-id=\"85098\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/artist-to-watch-ravyn-lenae/unnamed-68/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?fit=900%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85098\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/unnamed-5.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85098\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of YouTube</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crush </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EP introduces the hypnotic chorus of “The Night Song” — “Hair down, feeling alright, got my edges on tight, it’s a party tonight,” Lenae sings in a sweet cadence that has you in an instant trance. The entirety of the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Crush</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> EP carries the the nostalgia of Erykah Badu and Sade records. The brevity of Lenae’s discography does not take away from her artistic nature and her penchant for instrumentals. Her EPs act as a prerequisite for any efforts in the creation of a long-awaited studio album. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lenae clad in all-red attire on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crush</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cover acts as a prelude to the exuded confidence and Valentine’s-esque romance that seeps throughout her bubbly debut. Much like Ms. Lauryn Hill’s ability to utilize music as a meditative space for love and self-actualization in the early 90s, Lenae uses her lyrics to reflect on her identity and genuine romantic expressions of the 2010s. Lenae’s unabashed outlook on love that is not yet tainted by the self-deprecating insecurities of one’s early to mid-20s is refreshing. She provides a sense of relief and peppers in some optimism, a relief that we, too, will find ourselves dancing around because we are in love, whether that be with a partner or just coming to terms with loving ourselves. Artists like Lenae are the definitive forces of the decade, as they continuously bring polished, inventive sounds to the forefront. The ascension into stardom coupled with the bold outline of her name on a festival lineup is on the horizon in 2019 for the powerhouse that is Ravyn Lenae.</span></p>\n<div

released his first film on a streaming platform: Netflix. His newest film “Da 5 Bloods” is extremely political, and like his other films, focuses on Black struggles and oppression. Any history buff would enjoy it, but I recommend the film to everyone because the issues examined in it are unfortunately still prevalent today; especially right now with the new wave of the Black Lives Matter movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 5 Bloods are a group of five black men who were sent to fight for America during the Vietnam War. The film focuses on Paul (Delroy Lindo), Paul’s son David (Jonathan Majors), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), Melvin (Isiah Witlock Jr.), and Norman (Chadwick Boseman). The film opens with a clip of Muhammad Ali, who famously condemned the killings of people abroad because unlike the United States, those countries “never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality.” This starts a montage overlapped with Marvin Gaye’s voice, which is the first time of many he is heard in the film. There are clips of Black soldiers, war scenes and historical moments that happened around the time of the war, which was fought from 1955 to 1975. Then, there are photo inserts of Martin Luther King Jr., Angela Davis and Malcolm X, whose speeches are sprinkled throughout the movie, along with references to Black riots in response to injustices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Netflix preview I got the impression that the film was going to be primarily set during the Vietnam War, but instead it focused on the Bloods during modern-day America, and their time in the war was only briefly shown through flashbacks. Norman was killed during the war, so the other four Bloods return to Vietnam to find his body and the gold they buried about 40 years prior. One of Spike Lee’s most interesting cinematographic choices was to film the flashbacks with the same older actors that portray the four Bloods as in the present-day plot, instead of using younger ones in their place. In my opinion, this was a better choice because the four men were recalling their time in Vietnam and all were able to see themselves as the age they are, but they only remember Norman as young. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire journey in Vietnam brings back memories of the torture that the Bloods went through when they were young soldiers. They show symptoms of the PTSD they still experience, and though they seem proud to call themselves Americans, they also express the disgusting oppression they’ve been subjected to their entire lives. The war is also constantly referred to as the “American War” by the Vietnamese people, who still hold resentment towards the U.S. Yet, both sides show bitterness to each other still to this day; and as the Bloods’ tour guide discloses, “After you’ve been in a war, you understand it never really ends,” which the audience sees through the Blood’s own nervous breakdowns and in tense moments between them and Vietnamese locals who claim the men killed their families. Paul specifically becomes livid at the locals’ statements, and it is only at the end through his visions of Norman that he is able to own up to the truth of his corrupt time in the military. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Norman wasn’t only one of the 5 Bloods but also their leader, teacher and preacher. Otis explained he gave the bloods “Something to believe in. A direction, a purpose. He taught us about Black history when it wasn’t really popular back then… Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.” Norman emphasized peace and justice but wasn’t afraid to show his frustration with the treatment of Black people in America, and who better to have as the heroic idol of the group than the Black Panther himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During one of his many teachings, Norman stressed that “War is about money. Money is about war. Every time I walk out my front door, I see cops patrolling my neighborhood like it’s some police state. I can feel just how much I ain’t worth.” Black men were sent to Vietnam to fight for a country that was not fighting for them. They were fighting for the rights that they weren’t yet granted, and they were sent to die. Black and brown men disproportionately died during the war, because they were disproportionately sent. As Otis explains to Paul’s young son David, “White boys who stayed in college, they’d dodge that shit. They put our poor Black asses on the front lines, killing us off like flies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Da 5 Bloods” deals with emotional trauma caused because of the war, trust issues, complex relationships with fathers and the many and seemingly never-ending injustices experienced by Black people in America. While not my favorite Spike Lee movie, it was still an enjoyable and beneficial watch. The film takes a different approach to Vietnam War films, most of which focus on the hardships of white soldiers and may portray one token Black actor. They too often ignore and erase the Black men who were thrown into an unjust war and died for a country that didn’t care about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film reflects on how little change has happened since the Vietnam War, and how Black people in America still have to worry about losing their lives and lack of full rights every single day. Justice is slow, and because of that many of us get burnt out and discouraged, but we must continue to fight for our rights. Part of Netflix’s new Black Lives Matter category, the release date of “Da 5 Bloods” couldn’t have been at a more fitting time, and watching films that address systemic racism still prevalent in American society is a great way of educating yourself about Black issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 3.5/5 </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

From the start, the chat was going wild, first arguing about which of his two films is best and later arguing about whether submitted or live questions should be prioritized. Either way, Aster answered many compelling questions during the event. He is quirky, extremely intelligent and an obviously creative artist, though he looks like more of a Wes Anderson type of guy — not the type to create such personal, dark and twisted films. The enthusiastic hosts first began with some small talk about life in quarantine, and everyone was grateful to hear that Aster has spent it diligently working on new projects. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94755\" style=\"width: 1450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2039268341\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94754\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94755\" data-attachment-id=\"94755\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-01/a-s-program-board-presents-ask-ari-aster/screen-shot-2020-05-27-at-7-21-13-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=1440%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-27 at 7.21.13 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94755\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=888%2C555\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-27-at-7.21.13-PM.png?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Liliana Linan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With introductions out of the way, hosts Esteban Alvarado and Kiyomi Morrison began to ask students’ pre-submitted questions. One of mine was asked in the first 10 minutes: “What inspired you to begin filmmaking in the first place?” to which Aster simply responded, “Movies.” He chuckled and then elaborated, “Loving movies … I’ve always been obsessed with movies and then at a certain point I just wanted to make them. I guess the urge on some level is to have a dialogue with your heroes. You grow up, you love so many films, you love so many filmmakers that you kinda want to engage as deep of a level as you can.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As expected, most of the audience members were film majors, so Aster was asked about his experience at film school. At the American Film Institute, he was able to make “all the mistakes you were eventually going to make anyway” and admitted that he “ripped off everybody … I mean, I’m still ripping off everybody.” The conversation then shifted to his breakout film “Hereditary” from 2018 and “Midsommar,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which was released only one year later in 2019. Aster is regarded as a horror director but instead calls himself a “genre filmmaker.” Although he sees “Hereditary” as a horror film, he doesn’t “even know what ‘Midsommar’ is” and claims that, as the films’ creator, “It’s not even my job to categorize them.” This is true because film genres are made to satisfy viewers, to help marketing teams and to be judged by critics. So even if Aster isn’t strictly a horror movie maker, fans agree that his first two films are creating an exciting and new category of horror, much better than other cheesy contemporary scary movies that Aster perceives as “archaic” and annoying. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to another question about using light instead of relying on darkness to scare viewers in “Midsommar,” Aster expressed that he had “a very specific aesthetic in mind,” and he was never concerned about the movie being scary. He knew the production company, A24, would promote it as a horror movie, which worried him because he anticipated that marketing would “create expectations that the film had no interest in meeting.” His thinking was to make it an “anthropological travelogue” in Sweden, and if anything, he would call it an “existential horror film.” It is a film that is about “codependency,” so when a student asked if the film had a happy ending for its main character Dani, Aster explained that although she escaped a toxic codependent relationship with her boyfriend Christian, she then “found herself in another codependent relationship with the village.” So although the Swedish group or cult was “racist, homicidal” and obsessed with “eugenics,” Dani’s new relationship was “very well functioning” as opposed to the one with Christian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the last half of the interview, the hosts moved on to Aster’s first full-length film “Hereditary,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which like its successor film is about trauma and grief. Many students, both through pre-submitted questions and live chat questions, wanted to dive into Aster’s mind and learn the inspiration behind his complicated family story in “Hereditary.” He explained that the film depicts the “corrosive effects that grief can have on a family dynamic,” and the end can be seen as a metaphor for “trauma completely changing somebody, utterly, and not necessarily for the better.” Toni Collette’s performance was undeniably stunning and chilling, and yet she wasn’t nominated for an Academy Award; one student wondered if Aster believed she was “robbed” of that nomination or if he even cares about the Oscars. After a bit of scoffing at the idea, Aster said he didn’t care; however, he immediately admitted that “when that time of year rolls around, you care, ya know,” especially since his team believed Collette had “a chance,” though he wasn’t expecting anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, both of his films were shut out of any Academy Awards nominations, but one can hope he receives the recognition he deserves for future projects. Aster revealed that he is working on a “nightmare comedy,” having just finished a new draft, and said, “ All I know is that it’s gonna be four hours long, over 17 [years of age].” His production company, Square Peg, is also working on a remake of “Save the Green Planet,” which Aster is excited about because he wanted to know what it means to be a producer, and as a fan of the original film, he knew he wanted to take on the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This event was any movie lover’s dream as students were able to pick Aster’s brilliant mind and learn more about the film industry. In the last few minutes of the interview, Aster was asked another one of my questions and gave his advice to aspiring filmmakers: “It’s all very obvious but, I mean, if you want to write, write and finish something,” and if you want to direct, you have to find people and “film it with your phone if you have to.” As an end to the compelling event, Aster gave a shout out to the class of 2020, saying, “This is no way to graduate, but you did it … you don’t go to me for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inspiration words, but this is going to be over.” And, since he assumed most attendees were film students, he highlighted the importance of filmmaking, saying, “I don’t know what I would do without movies and TV while I rot in this apartment.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

Think about how the music made you feel upon first listen and how those sounds have resonated in some form or another as time has elapsed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in conjunction with recollections of the music enclosed within your favorite records, you also recalled the artwork which represents these collections of sound. From the Beatles’ <em>Sgt.

Working alongside figures such as Anderson .Paak, Lil Uzi Vert and Chronixx, Saunders has been steadily navigating through the art world with consistent and captivating work for years now.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up with interests rooted in music and skateboarding, Saunders was always attracted to art. He was an underground hip hop head who frequented local shows in Philadelphia, deejayed in his friend’s basement and collected vinyl records.</p>\n<p>“I feel like art, music and skateboarding all arise from the same place for me — stoned teenager watching skate videos, doing art, freestyling,” Saunders said. “I cut out all the ads from Transworld and Thrasher around my room and started seeing that I was attracted to graphic design without even knowing the term ‘graphic design.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82699\" style=\"width: 1204px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"730390254\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82699\" data-attachment-id=\"82699\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/01-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?fit=1194%2C972&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1194,972\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?fit=250%2C204&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?fit=888%2C723&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82699\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=888%2C723\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"723\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?w=1194&amp;ssl=1 1194w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=250%2C204&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=768%2C625&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/01.png?resize=1024%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82699\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>While studying illustration and graphic design at Tyler School of Art, Saunders ultimately settled on hand-cut collage work. His style is simultaneously classic and modern; hand-cut items from vintage sources such as old National Geographic or Playboy magazines are reworked into an iconically distinct visual concoction.</p>\n<p>The creative didn’t stop studying art after college, however. Saunders is constantly refining his craft and developing a better eye for the nuanced detail that is so integral to his artwork.</p>\n<p>His day-to-day routine typically consists of early caffeinated mornings of reading and design.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been trying to read a lot more lately to keep the mind sharp and to inform concepts in my art practice,” he said.</p>\n<p>Saunders recently made a move from Philadelphia, Pa. to Los Angeles, Calif.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the main difference about living on the west coast is my access to different sorts of source material. I order some things from the internet, but I love the old fashioned dig for good materials, and there are so many weekend flea markets and bookstores, I’ve been able to rapidly expand my printed matter collection,” he explained.</p>\n<p>While based in Philadelphia, Saunders began designing cover art for local musicians. One of his formative projects was in collaboration with a local indie band called Brown Recluse. From there, he continued to work with other artists and slowly built his portfolio.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82701\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"661672428\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82701\" data-attachment-id=\"82701\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/dbs-sp4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=2048%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,549\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DBS SP4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=250%2C67&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?fit=888%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-82701 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=888%2C238\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"238\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=250%2C67&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=768%2C206&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?resize=1024%2C275&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DBS-SP4.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82701\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>While you may not be familiar with Saunders, you’ve likely come across his artwork at some point. One of his most notable ventures was with rapper/singer/songwriter Anderson .Paak.</p>\n<p>Saunders connected with .Paak through Twitter. At the time, he was making portraits of rappers on Instagram and tagging them in his posts. Some of these portraits were even reposted by artists like Drake and Mac Miller. Nonetheless, .Paak eventually reached out to Saunders after stumbling upon artwork of some of his hip hop contemporaries. This relationship later blossomed into a poster series for a handful of .Paak’s concerts, then cover art for singles and albums.</p>\n<p>For <em>Malibu</em>, the musician’s sophomore LP behind the moniker “Anderson .Paak,” Saunders worked under the creative direction of designer Cory Gomberg. Together, the two teamed up to conceptualize the sounds of the critically acclaimed record into a visual manifestation of .Paak’s aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The cover art for <em>Malibu</em> is fascinating. The intricacies enveloped within the 1×1 picture are both chaotic and organized. Saturated in orange sunlight, Anderson .Paak sits at a glossy upright piano as foamy swells of ocean water and an assortment of miscellaneous items float around him.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82700\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"916128855\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82697\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82700\" data-attachment-id=\"82700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/dewey-bryan-saunders-the-artist-behind-your-favorite-album-cover-art/ap_malibu_cover_flat_ap_web-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_Malibu_Cover_Flat_AP_Web-2.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82700\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cover art for Anderson .Paak’s album <em>Malibu</em>, Courtesy of Dewey Bryan Saunders</p></div>\n<p>But, it would be a crime to think of Saunders only through the lens of his cover art. The creator is much more than that — he’s an artistic powerhouse who maintains ties to a ubiquity of creative spaces. Saunders is an illustrator, a designer, sometimes a musician. He releases artwork on social media sites daily and connects with his fans and supporters online. Saunders is undoubtedly the most active, accessible and engaging artist on social media I have ever encountered.</p>\n<p>“I feel that it is refreshing for people to know that I am a real person and by being super consistent and responsive, it makes people trust me as a brand,” Saunders said. “I like to have people kind of follow along my activities too, and it’s even good for family that lives all around the country that wants to know what I’ve been up to recently.”</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that the artist’s success didn’t evolve overnight. Saunders grew up in an age without Instagram. He promoted his craft by hand, mailing out flyers and samples of his work to anybody he could reach. Analogously, he’s had to make some sacrifices along the way.</p>\n<p>“I think sticking to a freelance lifestyle and taking a long time to develop a personal style was a bit of a sacrifice. Eventually that route worked out for me, but it was a long journey to where I am now and it still feels like the beginning,” Saunders elaborated. “I am really fortunate to be in the position of a graphic designer with a personal style that is desirable right now, and it was a tremendous amount of work — a supernatural effort to reach this level.”</p>\n<p>Saunders slices printed source material the same way a hip hop producer would sample a song. He operates meticulously with a focused and pragmatic demeanor.</p>\n<p>But Saunders isn’t done yet. He recently landed a promotional campaign with RayBan and is currently juggling a myriad of personal and commercial projects.
