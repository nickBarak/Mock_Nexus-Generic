Apparently a lot; the <em>Nexus</em> hit Coachella 2016, and here are some of Artsweek’s highlights.</p>\n<p><strong>LCD Soundsystem:</strong><br>\nExcessively buzzed about once they announced that they’d be reuniting for a new album and tour in 2016 after their dramatically heartfelt and measured disbanding in 2011, LCD Soundsystem delivered one of the most polished and groovable sets of the weekends. Soundsystem proved apt nomenclature, as main stage became scaffolded with keyboards, drum machines, synths and people to produce the intricately layered and progressive anthems the band churns out. Frontman/visionary James Murphy and an arrangement of longtime compatriots like Nancy Whang and Pat Mahoney riffed seamlessly through their patented danceable tracks that make you think, like “Someone Great,” “Get Innocuous,” “Daft Punk is Playing at My House” and “Dance Yrself Clean.” They also paid tribute to some late greats, with covers of Prince’s “Controversy” and David Bowie’s “Heroes.” “I wasn’t a huge fan of them before going to the festival, but one of my friends convinced me to go. Their music was really powerful. Murphy’s voice was unbelievably good, and their performance definitely made me a huge fan of the band. The set pretty much defined all of Coachella for me,” said UCLA sophomore Andrew Gorin. Such a definitive performance makes the band a welcome addition back into today’s musical landscape; the promise of the buzz was well-kept.</p>\n<p><strong>Sheer Mag:</strong><br>\nSheer Mag lead singer Tina Halladay welcomed the band’s noontime audience at the Mojave tent with an admittedly reticent “Hi, we’re Sheer Mag,” before tearing into the mic with the opening track off of their most recent III EP, “Can’t Stop Fighting.” Halladay carried a quiet yet detectable charisma about her — tough to detect from her notable refrain of crowd interaction but undeniable when her high-pitched vocals ground into a screech — as she belted heartbreak ballads and grievances with the American political system. Even despite the limitations of the 30-minute set length, the low-billing, Philly-based garage band proved to be one of the most impressive sets of the weekend due to their unusual marriage of ‘70s revivalist singing, fuzzy instrumental overlay and genuinely fun high-fi guitar riffs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Algiers:</strong><br>\nHot off of the release of their debut self-titled album, Algiers showcased both one of the most theatrically powerful and technically refined performances of the weekend in spite of their low-billing Saturday afternoon spot at the Mojave tent. Their sound sits somewhere in between post-punk and noise rock with a curveball peppering of gospel and blues. Lead vocalist and guitarist Franklin James Fisher would often spend the first minute of each song crouched on the stage looping cacophonic guitar riffs into a pedal, meticulously tinkering the distortion and then hastily tossing the guitar to the floor in favor of a tambourine and mic. Immediately following every other verse, Fisher collapsed at the knees into a position somewhere between a fetal curl and a prayer kneel, slamming the stage with the tambourine and a closed fist, the sweat on his back often glistening through his white-collared shirt. Songs were punctuated with late 20th century radio samples deploring institutionalized religion and served as the only nonmusical communication between band and audience. This was easily one of the most impressive sets of the weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>Courtney Barnett:</strong><br>\nCourtney Barnett has been on the receiving end of quite a bit of accolade, with her debut album Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit making many 2015 year-end lists and earning her a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Her distinctive lyrical style always feels like aimless meandering through vividly mundane yet accessible scenes of poolside crushes as a conduit for profound thought exploration, while always remaining playful enough to land far away from any sense of pretention. During “Elevator Operator” and “Small Poppies,” Barnett was brought to her knees mid-guitar solo in an act of rocker-geist possession often caricatured in bad ’70s hair metal bands but perfected by the endearingly manic Jack Whites and Dan Auerbachs of the world. In between songs, she awkwardly chuckled and said things like “We like you guys,” or a simple “Thanks,” almost as if her manager told her she had to be nice to her fans. More likely, though, she’s just that lone person at the party exchanging clunky pleasantries, but is actually super sweet once you get to know her.</p>\n<p><strong>Anderson .Paak &amp; The Free Nationals:</strong><br>\n2016 is the year of .Paak. Born Brandon Paak Anderson, the R&amp;B singer, songwriter, drummer, producer and rapper has largely slipped under the radar of hip hop fans for the majority of his professional music career. However, 2015 was exceptionally kind to .Paak, as Dr. Dre plucked the rapper out of obscurity to contribute to a whopping eight tracks on Dr. Dre’s latest release, Compton. .Paak’s January release, Malibu, has garnered him widespread media attention, citing his compositional complexity, strong lyrical content and energetic live performance. .Paak spent much of his Coachella performance bouncing between his mic and his drum kit with the only consistency throughout the performance confined to the intermittent declarations of his catch phrase, “Yes, Lord!” and his cheek-to-cheek, white-toothed grin. Both Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar came out in support of the budding star, a testament to both .Paak’s talent and his future enshrinement into the pantheon of West Coast musical legends.</p>\n<p><strong>Sufjan Stevens:</strong><br>\nAfter touring with an intimate and human set to support his last effort, 2015’s quiet and folky Carrie &amp; Lowell, fans didn’t know quite what to expect from the adeptly talented multi-instrumentalist in a 2016 festival setting. Flanked by a groovy Valkyrie duo of backup dancer-singers, a kinetic brass trio and eventually a cropping of inflatable air dancers, Stevens delivered an extravagantly theatrical act. There was banjo smashing, disco balling and costume changing (Suf wore erratic costumes ranging from a set of gigantic feathery wings, a get-up of dozens of swaying and bouncing mylar balloons, to a towering set piece resembling a crucifix-esque metallic jellyfish). He blasted through Age of Adz touchstones like “Too Much” and the 25-minute “Impossible Soul.” Even his C&amp;L cuts were arranged up to match the energy, culminating with a performance of “Fourth of July” in which Stevens and his backup cried out emphatically the refrain that “We’re all gonna die.” “It was a big change from the last time I saw him, in a really good way,” fourth-year biopsych major Roni Brawley said, who also called his timely Gallant-accompanied cover of “Purple Rain,” “moving.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sia:</strong><br>\nThe enigmatic Australian songstress held down main stage Sunday night with one of the most bizarrely artistic and moving sets to grace the polo fields in, possibly ever. Obscured in the corner by her signature black-and-blonde wig and a dwarfing oversized white bow, Sia let her belting vocals and a slew of guests weave her story of pain, depression and triumph. The set bolstered hits like “Diamonds,” “Titanium” and “Chandelier” with performance art conducted by the eclectic likes of a tearful Kristin Wiig, a bewildered and accosted Paul Dano, frequent collaborator and dance prodigy Maddie Ziegler and more, all unified under matching checkerboard wigs to match the songstress’s striking aesthetic. The level of artistry presented by the set was unprecedented for the festival, especially when stacked against the droves of partiers shoving through the agape crowd to camp out for Calvin Harris’s following set.</p>\n<p>Speaking of artistry, the visuals at this year’s fest were notably more subdued than the imaginatively photogenic fare of previous years. Poetic Kinetics, the design studio behind iconic works like the enormous and mobile snail, astronaut, and caterpillar/butterfly mascots were conspicuously absent this year, and the Do Lab stage, while still the center for free-for-all bone-vibrating bass and PLURality, re-used its Big Fish stage setup, which debuted last year. Rumors have abounded about the hefty sum Goldenvoice hoisted over to Guns N’ Roses for their headlining gig, siphoned off from supporting more visual artists. Whether these are founded or not, the money must’ve gone somewhere; in regard to the huge “Besame Mucho” piece backgrounding the polo field, senior Lauren Gutches scoffed astutely “Just because they’re in a different language doesn’t make giant words any more interesting as art.” Portals, a piece by Philip K. Smith, was a noticeable standout amidst the stagnance of the other works, reflecting and shifting subtly in light and color, as fourth-year Josh Swedelson noted, “like an Apple Store display crossed with the ‘Hotline Bling’ background.” As people posed for photos in front of the piece’s glowing rings, opening their own portals into their lives and themselves to become a part of the piece, the mirrored slats reflected outward onto the other-worldly festival outsides raging like the desert winds. Through music, art and, well, a lot of other things, Coachella offers portals into another universe for a weekend, one that it was a pleasure to get lost in.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70724\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70724\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-descends-upon-coachella-2016/","id":6761,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[6760,6759,6758],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek","biography":"Not available","articles":[6741,6761,6954,6964,6966,6978,6986,7006,7064,7091,7097,7101,7610,7731],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Iron & Wine: Mighty Fine","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13652982_10155081099833275_1380068762808936408_o.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13652982_10155081099833275_1380068762808936408_o.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“I don’t have a setlist,” the musician cooed lowly into the microphone...

The perennially bearded singer, clad in a velvet jacket, humbly welcomed the excitable applause from the audience, visibly excited to be in a new city. Almost every seat was filled of the sold-out show, and most seats were filled by non-student members of the community. The house lights were dimmed to almost nothing throughout the entire audience, and the stage lights cast a delicate glow on Beam’s face.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have a setlist,” the musician cooed lowly into the microphone while putting on one of the guitars. He then welcomed requests, prompting polite shouts from the audience for music old and new. As familiar titles floated up to the stage, he nodded with a smile, finished tuning his guitar and began picking out a soft bass line. It was clear that he decided to begin with an acoustic, slow-tempo version of “Boy with a Coin,” a single from his 2007 album <em>The Shepherd’s Dog</em>. Faces were difficult to see in the audience, but the feeling in the room indicated a concentration on only what was happening onstage. There was no chatter amongst the many couples, and there were no phone screens alight.</p>\n<p>Every quiet moment brought about more song requests from the audience, and in a moment of being a fan and not a writer, I was happy to hear “Such Great Heights” being shouted aloud, a personal favorite. It is a gentle cover of a track by The Postal Service, featured in the movie “Garden State,<em>”</em> the soundtrack for which brought a handful of indie artists to the mainstream during the early 2000s, including Iron &amp; Wine. Staying aligned with his folk roots, Beam himself has developed his own style of gentle fingerpicking over the years, thickening the sound by slapping the side of his hand against the body of the guitar for a sort of makeshift percussion. His charming mix of a southern drawl delivering worldly wit matched the crowd, creating a strong sense of both comfort and intimacy that settled over the room.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>‘The Iron &amp; Wine Buffet Show,” the lone singer jokingly christened the night, keeping the entire show open to audience suggestions. Only debuting two newer songs, this night was, of course, meant to please longtime listeners. “Tree By the River,” a fan favorite performed at almost every Iron &amp; Wine show, was the next request fulfilled. It is just one of many songs that showcase Beam’s skill for crafting effortlessly spun tales of front porch, lazy sun love. His voice covered the hall like velvet, almost identical to the rich softness of his recordings.</p>\n<p>Graciously exiting the stage, Beam left the audience giving him a standing ovation, calling out for more. He obliged, thanked the audience once more, and slowly began his encore song, “The Trapeze Swinger,” a nine-minute indie-folk opus from his 2009 compilation <em>Around the Well</em>. He promised to fulfill the requests not acknowledged during the show another time, seeming to make a roundabout promise to return to the city soon.</p>\n<p>“It was a mellow, emotional set, but definitely captivating for the whole audience,” Galen McDougal, a Santa Barbara local, said, presumably echoing the sentiments of the entire audience.</p>\n<p>The set was nearly two hours long, which is lengthy by most standards, but “he could have just kept playing tonight and that would have been amazing,” Lauren Perry, a Santa Barbara local, said. The gentle sounds of Iron &amp; Wine beautifully ushered in the Arts &amp; Lectures season, and the fall season itself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

reshaped by our generation, there appears to be something for just about everyone. While we are fixated on the idea of genres, true artists separate themselves from musicians in the way that their crafts break the rules outlined for a variety of musical barriers. This is something that young minds like that of 21 Savage has accomplished, crowning him with the label of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artist</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the world of hip-hop, we have been faced with an inexhaustible amount of “SoundCloud rappers” that make it difficult to distinguish what it is that sets true hip-hop artists apart from their kind. 21 Savage makes the distinction apparent in the way that he is able to flow in and out of this new wave of music by making songs that people enjoy, but not forgetting to stay true to his sound. He has made his mark in such a way that when a person hears something of his, they can easily say, “Yeah, this definitely a 21 Savage song,” or, “I bet 21 is on this track,” without having to check. It is a tough phenomenon to explain, but is incredibly apparent after both listening to his music and watching him take the stage. Lucky for Santa Barbarans, they will have the opportunity to experience 21 Savage’s infectious wave this Thursday at Velvet Jones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Atlanta  native is best known for his work with producer Metro Boomin along with his recent release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savage Mode</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Rising up in the rap scene without a label or promo team is not unheard of but can prove to make things more difficult when it comes to reaching listeners. This did not discourage 21 Savage but, rather, it pushed him to put more effort into his craft. His strong work ethic did not go unnoticed, as he was named in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">XXL</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> magazine “Freshman Class.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the fairly tranquil environment of Santa Barbara, it is fair to say that not a lot of people will relate to 21’s rough tales born from his life in the streets. But, it will be easy for the entire audience to understand why this night has the potential to be one his best performances. He has shared larger stages with people like Young Thug, but it is the fact that we are able to see him solo and before he reaches his peak that makes this night special. 21 Savage is young, charismatic and will not filter himself for anyone. If you did not think he was a big deal, he will have you rethinking that by the end of his show.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

After his surprise mixtape <i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late</i> of March 2015, his devastating lyrical dissection of Meek Mill last summer and his infectious, collaborative mixtape last fall with Future, <i>What a Time to Be Alive,</i> the Drizzy hype has been just about inescapable for anyone with an internet connection. All of these raging successes, however, have been mere stepping stones leading to the landmark that took the internet by storm last thursday: Drake’s highly anticipated new album, <i>Views. </i></p>\n<p>Since the album’s release date was announced back in January, all eyes have been on the Toronto native. Extreme hype has been built up for this album; <i>Views </i>has popped up in shops in major cities, advertising billboards all over Toronto, an announcement for a tour with Future, wildly popular pre-released singles and, in the true spirit of Drake, countless internet memes. Released exclusively on Apple music, many excited fans — this writer included — signed up for a free trial to get to the music as soon as possible, carrying high expectations and childlike anticipation.</p>\n<p>Although the album is arguably not Drake’s best work to date, <i>Views </i>offers Drake in his purest form, with peak vulnerability and comfort over extremely strong production. At 20 tracks, the work feels a bit excessive and unnecessary, but the consistent supply of grooves along with the balance of upbeat and slow tracks  keeps listeners heavily intrigued. Overall, with a fair share of smooth vocals and gentle progressive vibes, <i>Views</i> feels reminiscent of vintage R&amp;B, emotional Drake.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Some of the album’s strongest tracks are the singles that were released prior to the full album, including minimalistic banger “Pop Style,” caribbean dance anthem “One Dance” and mega-hit of last summer, “Hotline Bling” (as a bonus track). “Pop Style” specifically came as a new album version that features only Drake verses rather than the single version, which included Kanye West and Jay-Z. Although incredible and iconic tracks, the pre-release route seemed to be a bad call, much like putting all of the funniest scenes of a movie in the preview. This lapse in marketing, however, could not shadow the multiple other highlight tracks that <i>Views</i> offers.</p>\n<p>Heavy hitting slappers “Still Here,” “Hype” and Future collaboration “Grammy’s” provide the most upbeat moments of the project and remind listeners of Drake’s powerfully strong 2015 hits. However, besides these new tracks and “Pop Style,” the album mainly highlights Drake’s soft singing voice and the hip-shaking, smoothly bouncing production from his OVO team.</p>\n<p>Some other stand out tracks include “Feel No Ways,” which includes synth tones that sound straight out of the ‘80s, and collaboration with Rihanna, “Too Good,” which features a steady dance drum beat that demands dancing. These songs most accurately capture the general feel of the album, as<i> Views</i> is less about the rap hits and more about the iconic OVO soul vocals.</p>\n<p>This new stepping stone for Drizzy marks a semi-significant musical change in his ever-evolving style. With <i>Views </i>as well as <i>If You’re Reading This</i>, we hear his production transition into a more minimalist theme. All of the beats on this album showcase a very thin, almost calm structure, which is contradictory to his past <i>Take Care</i> days of densely layered beats. We generally only hear two or three sounds in the background, thus putting all the focus on the clever introspection of the 6 God.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Drake’s past work, it pains me to say that although <i>Views </i>is a very consistent album that will make for a lot of intimate moments, it just doesn’t live up to its potential. Given Drizzy’s previous work, his smash hits last summer and the earth-shattering hype that led up to it, the music here could just do a little better. There’s nothing wrong with this album by any means. The beats are nicely flowing and it definitely has its high moments, but it all seems to plateau at a midpoint and never really blow any minds.</p>\n<p>As I said before, Drake has been fucking up the rap game for some time now. He’s had <i>Pitchfork</i> features, headlining gigs at festivals, groundbreaking albums and owls as far as the eye can see. Maybe he got too comfortable or maybe his reign is coming to an end, but Drizzy just missed a big opportunity. The 6 God was given a true shot at rap immortality, but instead of redefining the game, Drake merely stirred it up.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70625\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70625\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-03/views-from-the-805/","id":6760,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6759,6758,6757],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
