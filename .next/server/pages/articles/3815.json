When the little lost lady admitted that she did not know of any to call, the officers asked if she at least knew the address she was trying to find.<br>\n“Why would I know the address by heart?” she asked.<br>\nShe went on to say she was with some friends earlier in the night, but was separated due to a power outage — falling trees are such a buzzkill.<br>\n“How could I see anybody?” she asked in all seriousness.<br>\nThe officers were no longer feeling sorry for this dunce and asked her to recite the alphabet. She huffed and she puffed, but all she could blow out were the letters “ORX, YMZ and WXYMZ.”<br>\nAccording to the police report, the woman could not successfully perform the small task “despite her being in college.”<br>\nOfficers arrested the boozy bimbo for public intoxication — and for wasting money and resources on higher education — and booked her in Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><strong>Pants-Off Dance-Off</strong></p>\n<p>Wednesday, Feb. 16, 2:43 a.m. —</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s finest were wandering the 6600 block of Trigo Rd. where not a soul was in sight when they noticed a pantless, chilly-looking young man strutting his stuff.<br>\nConsidering the rain, deputies determined that this man looked a tad out of place.<br>\nOfficers then approached Captain Underwear and asked him where he lived. The man responded three times with the same string of numbers and no street address. When asked how much he had to drink, he responded he had 16 shots that night, which he said was more than he typically consumes.<br>\nEventually, the officers also had to ask where his pants were. The Undie King had no idea, but said he was a tad cold.<br>\nOfficers arrested the man and transported him to Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, sans pants, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/","id":3815,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3814,3813,3812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros","biography":"Not available","articles":[3523,3683,3811,3812,3814,3815,3832],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While strolling by Anisq’ Oyo’ Park, an Isla Vista Foot Patrol officer noticed a particularly intoxicated individual stumbling about with a white paper bag in hand.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Shocking, but True…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saturday, January 22, 2:15 a.m. —</strong> While strolling by Anisq’ Oyo’ Park, an Isla Vista Foot Patrol officer noticed a particularly intoxicated individual stumbling about with a white paper bag in hand.</p>\n<p>Upon being approached, the man hastily turned in the opposite direction, threw his bag of uneaten food on the ground and bolted.</p>\n<p>The eco-friendly officer, outraged at the apparent environmental apathy, called after the dumping drunk to pick up his trash.
