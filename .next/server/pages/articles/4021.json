Comer, director of SBC Public Health Microbiology Laboratory,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, SBC public health officer in the Public Health Department, to elaborate on how the county is responding to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would like to have everyone tested, but unfortunately, at the moment, we just cannot afford it. I’m looking forward to the next week or 10 days when we have a much better capability [for testing],” Ansorg said. “I urge people to understand that this is not in our hands. Nationwide, there are low shortages of important ingredients in these test kits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg explained that the county has created a priority tier system for those who need to be currently tested.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Tier 1 are the “most vulnerable,” such as elderly individuals in senior residential facilities and nursing homes, as well as health care workers such as doctors and nurses, whose services are “critical.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tier 2 is composed of severely ill people, cases “where it would make a big difference if they are diagnosed early.” In Tier 3, the lowest category, are people who are “very mildly ill.” Those classified in Tier 3 should isolate themselves until they are fever free for three days, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panel members noted they’ve seen a number of questions from community members about how the virus is spread; Batson explained that the coronavirus is transmitted “via droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The coronavirus is] unlike other airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis that don’t weigh as much … Whenever someone coughs, the droplet can typically only go three feet,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is one of the reasons we are encouraging social distancing because if you stay away from someone who is coughing and the droplet can only go three feet, then it is unlikely you would inhale the infectious droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the virus can also be transmitted by touching surfaces, which is why it is important for individuals to continually disinfect surfaces such as doorknobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg said that while currently the county has “more than enough” collection kits to be able to test symptomatic patients, more test kits will be available as “more labs are coming online.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comer clarified that between the Cottage Hospital system and private offices, there are over 1,700 coronavirus testing kits. Van Do-Reynoso said that “to the best of our knowledge, [getting tested] is very affordable because it is free. There is no cost-sharing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you’re coming down with a sore throat, nasal congestion, a cough, a fever, please consider yourself a potential case. I don’t mean this in order to make people afraid, but take this seriously,” Ansong said. “Do not go to work. Do not mingle with people. Stay isolated and take care of yourself.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 17, 2:56 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p>Steil had <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-23/ucsb-student-arrested-for-isla-vista-assault-previously-arrested-for-beating-of-rival-frat-member-at-mississippi/\">also been previously arrested</a> for assault in Mississippi in 2015, when he was a freshman at the University of Mississippi.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon arrival, officers arrested Steil, who had “blood on his clothing.” The victim was bleeding from their lip following the altercation with Steil, according to the booking report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the booking report, a witness at the scene spoke to the officers, stating that they saw the “victim and &amp; Steil (suspect) fighting/throwing punches and that the word ‘faggot’ was being exchanged.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Oscar Perez, a second-year UCSB student who spoke to the Nexus, Perez was walking to Rockfire Grill when he and his group of friends were approached by a man </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who Perez later identified as Steil — with blood on his shirt, who began following them. The man also called one of Perez’s friends a homophobic slur, Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t know what he was going to do so we were just telling him ‘Go home.’ Everyone was telling him to go home. We were all thinking he was going to fight us, but he didn’t,” Perez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the man left, a woman approached them “checking for blood on our hands,” Perez added. Perez pointed out the man who had been following them to the woman, who she then ran up to. She was looking for the man who was “saying all the bad stuff about homosexuals,” according to another student present at the scene who requested to remain anonymous and verified Perez’s recounting of the events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, the man punched her and began kicking her while she was on the ground; a fight then began between an unknown number of people in the middle of Pardall Road, near Six Pak Shop, according to the unnamed student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once detained, Steil admitted to officers that he used the word “faggot” during the altercations and that he had consumed multiple alcoholic beverages that night, according to the booking report; the report also stated that “[Steil] was determined to be the aggressor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A person who identified themselves as a victim of the incident posted on Twitter detailing their injuries: “The word ‘FAGGOT’ cost me a concussion, 7 stitches, a fractured nose, and 3 broken teeth,” they said, adding that one of the women assaulted also had a hand broken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also stated that they will be “taking all actions necessary to have [the attacker] face all possible consequences.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chancellor, judicial affairs, and anywhere else. Enough is enough. There is no room for hate, only love,” one of the tweets read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because news of the Rockfire altercation spread quickly through social media, many students and community members had learned about the situation through unofficial channels, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Ethan Bertrand said at the Nov. 12 meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand addressed the incident and criticized the lack of communication between the community and public safety agencies when serious situations arise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s absolutely maddening that members of this board and members of the community heard about this through Twitter and not from our public safety agencies who respond to this. And I say that it’s maddening because we’ve dealt with this before,” Bertrand said during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unacceptable and offensive as a member of this Isla Vista LGBTQ community to have this go on and for it to not be worthy of public attention and not to be worthy of a serious community response.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the board discussed the availability of I.V. CSD press releases to the public, one student — who said they are friends with one of the victims in the Rockfire incident — echoed Bertrand’s thoughts regarding the critical role that widely available information plays in the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that multiple sexual assaults have occurred this past month and there was a hate crime against someone who’s actually very near to my heart, it is not okay that we don’t have people standing up for us,” said the student, who did not identify themselves at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing a press release with transparency would be really helpful to the community to help us heal. Having all these incidents back to back to back has been a lot for a lot of different students and showing survivors that there are these resources that you provide as our government on a local level would be very beneficial,” the student continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum at the Nov. 13 Associated Students Senate meeting, Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi also spoke about the altercation and described the incident as a “homophobic hate crime.” She added that one of the victims sustained a concussion, seven stitches and a broken jaw.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to advocate for this,” she said. “Not because this person asked me to but because hate crimes in our community aren’t something we expect, because we believe that everyone is open minded.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have to remember there are some people in our community who do hold that hate in their heart.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadidi called for more transparency between law enforcement, the university and its students, telling the Senate that, “I think it’s a little bit unacceptable that some of you are looking at me like you’re hearing this for the first time and that we haven’t heard about it as a community from our administration.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, on Nov. 14, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead sent an email to all students regarding a “physical assault” incited by “homophobia, racism, and/or xenophobia.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We find acts of violence intolerable, and those motivated by bias rooted in homophobia, racism, and other oppressive prejudices particularly despicable,” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB administration is currently in contact with those involved, according to the email, and said the absence of a Timely Warning was a result of the crime occurring on a location not covered by the Clery Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email included a promise from administrators to keep a clear line of communication with students regarding safety concerns. Previously, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">administration held a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-administration-addresses-students-concerns-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1574324944756000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKjRIafuPWGx52Xw-pAsjfuXkXFQ\">town hall</a> where students voiced a need for active communication between public officials and the community, following <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1574325528870000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEAgAkwkBcTqUPieQ7tHGQ2Fe6DA\">multiple allegations of sexual assault</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, we want to share this information with you promptly so that you are aware of the incident and know that we are responding,” Klawunn and Armistead added in the email. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 23, 9:01 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Hartmann <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\">defeated</a> Porter in 2016 with about 54% of the vote.</p>\n<p>A third candidate, Santa Ynez Community Service District Director Karen Jones, expects to raise and spend under $2,000 for her entire campaign, <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Default.aspx\">according to a filing</a>.</p>\n<p>The 3rd District, spanning UC Santa Barbara, Isla Vista, the Santa Ynez Valley and Guadalupe, has traditionally served as the swing vote on the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>Porter raised approximately $400,000 — about $12,000 more than Hartmann — between Jan. 1, 2019 and Feb. 15, 2020, according to <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Default.aspx\">campaign filings.</a></p>\n<p>Since then, Porter has significantly outraised Hartmann in large donations. He received over $119,000 in donations larger than $1,000, while Hartmann has only reported $11,000, according to the <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Default.aspx\">campaign filings</a>.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s top donor is Alice Gillaroo, a retired Santa Ynez resident. Gillaroo has donated $58,000 to Hartmann’s campaign as of March 2, 2020.</p>\n<p>Other major donors to Hartmann’s campaign include the Santa Barbara County Firefighters Government Committee, which donated $45,000, and Richard Mazess, a retired Santa Barbara resident who donated $20,000.</p>\n<p>Charles Zegar, a retired Santa Barbara resident, and Jack and Laura Dangermond, Redlands residents who founded the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), each donated $15,000 to her campaign.</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-TFVQ9\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Top contributors to Joan Hartmann's campaign&amp;nbsp;\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TFVQ9/2/\" height=\"404\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();\n</script></p>\n<p>Porter’s largest donor is Buellton First, a political action committee based in Santa Ynez, which donated $120,000. Close behind is the Santa Barbara County Republican Party, which has <a href=\"http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1018654&amp;session=2019&amp;view=late2\">donated</a> about $70,000 in nonmonetary items to Porter’s campaign.</p>\n<p>Porter has also extensively self-financed his campaign — he loaned his campaign $75,000 and donated another $18,000 toward nonmonetary items, such as “campaign swag.”</p>\n<p>Other top donors to Porter’s campaign include A. Brooks Firestone, a former county supervisor who donated $20,500, and the campaign of Bob Nelson, a candidate for the 4th District supervisor seat, which donated $15,000 to Porter. Nelson’s campaign also provided a $10,000 loan and over $8,000 in yard signs to Porter’s campaign.</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-lk321\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Top contributors to Bruce Porter's campaign\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lk321/4/\" height=\"387\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();\n</script></p>\n<p>About 77% of Hartmann’s contributions have been from individual donors.

Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) served a search warrant on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by SBSO Saturday morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the search, detectives recovered numerous items that were taken during the robbery and they arrested two suspects,” Raquel Zick, SBSO spokesperson, said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meteke was charged with robbery and false imprisonment and booked on a $100,000 bail, while Hebbar faces accessory charges with a $20,000 bail. Hebbar is a UCSB student, according to the student directory; Meteke’s custody logs state he is a student, but the name of the college he attends is not listed.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2 p.m. on Saturday, Meteke is still in custody, according to custody logs. Hebbar is no longer in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investigation is ongoing, Zick said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p>No further suspects have been arrested as of Monday, Zick told the Nexus.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown whether the police have located the third suspect involved in the incident. SBSO did not immediately return requests for comment involving the arrests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initial reports came in around 10:23 a.m. on Nov. 18 that three individuals had fled a house on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road in Isla Vista after reportedly robbing two victims at gunpoint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two victims had been inside the apartment at the time; one sustained minor injuries. The suspects took two laptops, one phone, one wallet and cannabis, police said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zick said at the time that police believed the victims were “specifically targeted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the suspects — a white man wearing a ski mask and all black and a white man wearing no ski mask and camouflage — were armed with handguns, while the third, a black man who was wearing all black, was reportedly not carrying a gun. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updated [Nov. 25, 12:44 p.m.]</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
