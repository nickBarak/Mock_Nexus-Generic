\r\n</script> \n<p>In Oklahoma City’s 108-102 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals Monday night, Thunder forward Kevin Durant’s step back dagger of a jump shot with 30.7 seconds remaining was a silent reminder of who reigns supreme in the team’s coveted 1-2 punch made up of himself and Russell Westbrook.</p>\n<p>Despite a 10-30 shooting night, going 2-11 in the fourth quarter, KD stayed committed to what each and every generation of shooters and scorers are told: KEEP SHOOTING.</p>\n<p>Surpassing LeBron James as the NBA’s best player in some fans’ player rankings just a few years back, it seems as if many have forgotten about the former 2013-14 MVP, four-time scoring champion and seven-time All-Star in lieu of Westbrook’s breakout seasons over the past year and a half.</p>\n<p>Ruled out indefinitely after playing in 27 games last season due to a Jones stress fracture in his right foot which required three surgeries, Durant’s hype gradually faded away as his body of work was slightly overshadowed by the championship run of Curry and the Warriors, LeBron’s return to Cleveland and the post All-Star break outburst of his teammate Westbrook who ended the 2014-15 season with eleven triple-doubles.</p>\n<p>With Westbrook tying NBA legend Erving ‘Magic’ Johnson’s all-time single-season record of 18 triple-doubles this season, notions of Durant as the Thunder’s secondary option became more convincing than ever.</p>\n<p>While the glitz and glamor of triple-doubles can be mesmerizing, has anyone taken the time to acknowledge the expense Westbrook’s success has come with?</p>\n<p>Sure, Westbrook led the league in scoring last season with an average of 28.1 points per game, yet he led the NBA in turnovers per game with 4.4 and nearly replicated these results this season, finishing just behind James Harden with 4.3 turnovers per game.</p>\n<p>Although Westbrook missed 15 games last season due to injury, which hindered OKC’s pursuit of securing the eight-seed, he was one of the most inefficient players during clutch periods of games in the regular season.</p>\n<p>According to <em>82games.com</em>, “clutch’ is defined as the period of the fourth quarter or overtime with less than five minutes left and neither team is ahead by more than five points. Westbrook’s volume of shots in late game situations display the ball dominance that occasionally detracts from the point guard’s impact on the court.</p>\n<p>Based on production per 48 minutes of clutch time, Westbrook averaged 51.2 total points, a scoring total that ranked third in the league. The five-time NBA All-Star was insufficient with his shot selection, taking 49.9 field goal attempts while shooting just 38.3 percent from the field and an abysmal 0.87 from beyond the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As expected with the return of Durant, Westbrook’s shot attempts in clutch time have endured a substantial decrease, which has served to his own benefit. Prior to the beginning of the NBA Playoffs, Russ concluded the season 14th in points with a 39.3 average on 32.1 field goal attempts in addition to shooting 38.9 percent despite a subpar 20.0 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>Aside from three-point percentage, KD has actually been more efficient in his return this season than his 2013-14 MVP campaign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71133\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71133\" data-attachment-id=\"71133\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/fullsizerender3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=566%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,165\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender(3)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=250%2C73&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?fit=566%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71133\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?resize=566%2C165\" alt=\"Statistics courtesy of 82games.com\" width=\"566\" height=\"165\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?w=566&amp;ssl=1 566w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender3.jpg?resize=250%2C73&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71133\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Statistics courtesy of 82games.com</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71134\" style=\"width: 581px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71134\" data-attachment-id=\"71134\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/fullsizerender4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=571%2C195&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"571,195\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender(4)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=250%2C85&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?fit=571%2C195&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71134\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?resize=571%2C195\" alt=\"Statistics courtesy of 82games.com\" width=\"571\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?w=571&amp;ssl=1 571w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender4.jpg?resize=250%2C85&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Statistics courtesy of 82games.com</p></div>\n<p>Certainly one must consider the major constraints of OKC’s roster last season; he lost some of its scoring with the trade of Reggie Jackson to the Detroit Pistons and had to acclimate the role of Enes Kanter into the lineup after receiving him from the Utah Jazz in a three-team trade including the New Orleans Pelicans and lost Serge Ibaka for 18 games due to injury. It’s easy to argue that Westbrook had no choice but do to it all on his own.</p>\n<p>However, the team went 7-4 in the 11 games in which the Thunder’s floor general recorded a triple-double. Nonetheless, Oklahoma City endured two losing streaks of two or more games during his scoring, rebounding and assisting run. Nonetheless, the team finished 2-9 when Westbrook scored 40 or more points last year.</p>\n<p>Yet in his eighth season it has been a milestone season for Westbrook. Along with tying Magic’s triple-double record, Westbrook set a career-high in assists per game with a 10.4 average, his first time in double-figures.</p>\n<p>Arguably one of the NBA’s top five players, the aim was never to degrade the outstanding talent and determination of Westbrook but rather to remind those that KD is the driving force in Oklahoma City potentially becoming the next world champions.</p>\n<p>Currently third all-time in career points per game with a 27.4 average, Durant was the first introduction of many NBA fans of our generation to the hybrid, big-man-with-finesse playing style that is commonly witnessed today.</p>\n<p>Not one sign of regression appears in KD’s game thus far, surpassing the Black Mamba’s streak of consecutive games with 20-plus points at 67 games.</p>\n<p>In comparison to who many consider today as the NBA’s best player in Steph Curry, KD finished with a comfortable difference against the back-to-back MVP who had a scoring stretch of 20-plus for just 14 games earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>Both 27 years old and in their primes, inevitably the Durant-Westbrook duo will go down as one of the best player combinations in NBA history. Yet while KD’s game on the court may not be the most illustrious to the eye, the label as the league’s best could be most fitting with the “Darantula” in years to come.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71131\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71131\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/durant-still-the-alpha-dog-in-okc-remains-amongst-nbas-elite/","id":3306,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3305,3304,3303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"#LeahStrong: Strength in Inches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/leah-strong-2.jpg?resize=355%2C225&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/leah-strong-2.jpg?resize=400%2C225&ssl=1","description":"Appearing in her father Devon Still's wedding as the flower girl some weeks back, the courageous battle of Leah Still is celebrated by Staff Writer Elliot Thornton.

This unique mold of “strength” fits the character of 6-year-old Leah Still.</p>\n<p>A full-time daughter, “Uptown Funk” dancer and cancer survivor, Leah has permeated the hearts of many during her road to recovery. Daughter of current Houston Texan and former Cincinnati Bengal defensive tackle Devon Still, the two have come a long way since their experience of misfortune in June 2014.</p>\n<p>The then 4-year-old Leah was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma, an aggressive disease which attacked the preschooler’s vital glands and yielded a 50/50 chance of survival. The odds were unfavorably stacked against the NFL player and his daughter.</p>\n<p>While tears and agony barely consoled the hearts of her friends and family members, oddly enough the 4-year-old girl took on her challenge with a collected mind and grin on her face.</p>\n<p>After undergoing four months of radiation, surgery and remission treatment, results indicated a steady decline of Leah’s harmful tumors. There was no doubt about it: The upbeat child was beating cancer.</p>\n<p>Much like his daughter, who faced this dreadful disease head on, Still did not let this alarming setback hinder him from assisting his daughter. He wrote the slogan “Leah Strong” on his nasal strip every time he stepped on the field, and this motto quickly circulated through the nation, making everyone aware that Leah’s fight was bigger than she was.</p>\n<p>Fans on and off the gridiron showcased their united support for the 26-year-old Still, including the Bengals organization, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and New Orleans Saints Head Coach Sean Payton, who bought 1,000 Devon Still jerseys in response to the lineman’s cause. In total, over $1 million were raised for his daughter and other families locked in a similar battle with pediatric cancer.</p>\n<p>The brave Leah also received recognition from celebrities at the 2015 Espy Awards. Earning herself the Jimmy V Award, the highest honor for courage and perseverance, Leah officially joined the ranks of sports heroes such as the late Stuart Scott, former Rutgers star Eric LeGrand and Hall of Famer George Karl who have had their medical battles recognized on a grand scale.</p>\n<p>A successful triumph over life’s biggest obstacle led young Leah to become the flower girl in her father’s wedding last Sunday. Full of life and energy and ready for the big stage, it was Leah who stole the show on her father’s big day with her moves on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>This moment was a celebration of a new chapter in the Still family, but more importantly it signified a celebration of life itself. Leah’s battle with cancer was finally over. She surmounted her biggest obstacle, and that is definitely a moment that everyone could enjoy.</p>\n<p>Leah’s story is the story of a little kid with a big heart which warms the minds of many, a girl whose narrative proved to be just as inspiring as those of the athletes we adore today.</p>\n<p>On that day of matrimony for Devon Still, his daughter was not just his flower girl. She was a fighter, who persevered and is a living testament to the fact that when life’s struggles try to bring you down, you can still remain strong within.</p>\n<p>It is this idea of “strength” that will carry on in Leah Still forever.</p>\n<p>#LeahStrong</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Becoming the first player in Big West history to earn three straight Big West Offensive Player of the Week awards this season, DePuy’s impact on the field is inevitable as Santa Barbara is 16-0-4 all-time when the forward scores a goal.

track career in the blink of an eye, and has now come back just two years later to rewrite the Gauchos’ record books in her favorite event, the 1500m. And she’s not done yet.</p>\n<p>Tori came into the UCSB track program five years ago as the fastest recruit of her year with some very impressive credentials out of Presentation High School in San Jose.</p>\n<p>She was MVP of her high school squad all four years, and she ran the most competitive time of her Gaucho class at the California state finals her senior year, placing 13th in the 800m with a time of 2:12.82.</p>\n<p>When asked why she chose Santa Barbara, she immediately said “beach.” However, while the location of the school is undoubtedly a huge pull for recruits, for her, this was just one reason among countless others of why she chose to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“It was just a switch, like ‘I belong here.’ Everyone seemed really hardworking, and [it seemed like] an everyone’s-there-for-each-other kind of thing,” Tsolis said. “The day after my recruiting trip, I got home and I called [Head Coach] Pete [Dolan] and was like, ‘I want in.’”</p>\n<p>The star runner earned a scholarship eventually with her performance at state finals, but she still accepted less for the opportunity to study and compete at her dream school.</p>\n<p>“I could have gone to a different school and gotten a lot more money, but I just liked it here so much, and it’s paid off,” said Tsolis. “And I feel like I’m a pretty good recruiting investment, if you ask me.”</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Head Coach Pete Dolan would agree on that point now, after all the success the two have enjoyed together. But this was not always so clear-cut.</p>\n<p>Before Tori even started her first year of school at UCSB, she got off to a rocky start. She came in and got injured in just the first couple weeks of cross country training over the summer before freshman year, forcing her out of cross competition that season.</p>\n<p>Then track season came around, and it didn’t go very well. She didn’t PR in the 800, and although she did have a PR in the 1500, she now knows that even that time was nowhere near her potential.</p>\n<p>As if her underperformance wasn’t discouraging enough, right before the conference finals, Tori suffered a back injury that prevented her from participating in the conference event and set her back for her sophomore year cross season as well.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the injuries continued as she endured a stress fracture, forcing her out of competition for the entirety of the season.</p>\n<p>“This was just a very low point in my running career here … I just didn’t even have to go to practice, and I was making all these new friends, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it anymore,” Tsolis explained.</p>\n<p>As Tori started to get healthy again that summer, Dolan was getting frustrated with how things seemed to be turning out.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking she’s just kind of becoming a rec runner. She can run [at this point], but she wasn’t really training, just running,” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>Eventually what got Tori back on track, both literally and figuratively, was some much-needed prodding from a friend and teammate who just graduated last year.</p>\n<p>“Her teammate, Dani Moreno gets the credit,” said Dolan. “Dani Moreno still believed in her and said, ‘If you still want to do this, you’ve got to get after it.’”</p>\n<p>Then, right before her junior year track season, Dolan told her with two weeks notice that she needed to do a two-mile time trial to stay on the team. To make things even more difficult, he gave her no target time to hit.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘You’ve just got to impress me, Tori. C’mon, you’ve got good credentials in high school. Just impress me.’”</p>\n<p>Tori trained as best she could, and with the help of Moreno pacing her at the start, she was able to run 11:06 to impress Dolan and keep her spot on the team.</p>\n<p>“That was the point when I was like, ‘OK, I can’t give up,’” said Tsolis. “That was when I was like, ‘If I do this well, I’m going to stay on the team and keep running, and if I don’t then I’m going to be done with my running career at UCSB.’”</p>\n<p>Since the time trial, Tori has been able to stay relatively healthy for the rest of her career while consistently pushing herself in her training.</p>\n<p>She began chipping away at her times as soon as she returned to the track her junior season, working hard to get back into it.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting her to run that fast ’cause it was her first real season back, [but] it got better and better and, most of the time, I was just shaking my head and going, ‘I can’t believe she’s running this fast,’” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>It all goes back to what Dolan said prior to the time trial: “Impress me.” Now, she impresses him all the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70854\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1809397136\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70875\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70854\" data-attachment-id=\"70854\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/courtesy-of-tori-tsolis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=1040%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1040,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70854\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=294%2C453\" alt=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" width=\"294\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1 163w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1182&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Tori Tsolis</em></p></div>\n<p>Tsolis made it to the first round of regionals that junior year. Then in her senior year in 2015, she was able to advance to the second race of the first round, moving up to No. 2 on the UCSB all-time list in the 1500m in the process.</p>\n<p>This season, she finally broke the 11-year-old school record in the 1500m with a 4:19.02 at the Mt. Sac College Invite a few weekends ago.</p>\n<p>“I was ninth in my race, so I just stood there watching [the clock] go by each one. I’m like, ‘Come on, what did I run?’” Tsolis said. “And then I saw it, and I just tried to find my coach in the stands and I was like, ‘I did it!’”</p>\n<p>As the team works through postseason play now, Tori is looking to make it to nationals and become an All-American this year. She also hopes she can help her team to a top-three finish in the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>“That’s where I’m looking right now,” said Tsolis. “It sounded ambitious going into the year, but now it’s more tangible, I think.”</p>\n<p>Dolan knows Tori is already in the upper echelon of athletes he has had the chance to coach, but if she reaches these goals, he knows she will forever cement her legacy at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“That last race at Mt. Sac (where she beat the UCSB record in the 1500), it was off the charts,” Dolan said. “My heart’s pumping, I’m going, ‘Wow, she’s doing it. She is right there with the best in the country.’ So I’m just staying with that.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Tsolis’ commitment has influenced one of the other two Toris on UCSB’s women’s team, junior decathlete Tori Usgaard, who says she has always looked up to the elder Tori for her mindset and work ethic.</p>\n<p>“Every time you see her work out, she’s always pushing herself to be front of the pack. I think that’s the biggest thing, that she proves to everyone else that hard work pays off,” Usgaard said. “[She’s proof] that it takes time, but you have to trust the process and it’ll all come through eventually.”</p>\n<p>Tsolis is happy to focus this much time and energy on her training because of how rewarding it is for her to see the results.</p>\n<p>“It’s like you get out of it what you put into it, and I spend so many hours practicing. I’m on the bike, I’m on the elliptical, I’m in the pool,” Tsolis said. “[All] because I can’t run as much as I want to because I get injured easily. So I’m just doing weights and everything to stay healthy and injury-free, and it’s so rewarding now that everything has come together.”</p>\n<p>Tori also points to the endless support and understanding of her lifestyle from her family and friends as a huge influence that pushes her and keeps her going. Her dad in particular has been trying to fly down from San Jose to watch all her races this year.</p>\n<p>“I feel bad, but he’s like, ‘It makes me really happy to see you race!’” said Tsolis. “I’m like, ‘I only race for like four minutes!’”</p>\n<p>Tori has had an incredible track career for someone who almost faded out of the sport altogether halfway through college.</p>\n<p>It only makes it more impressive that she’s now training and competing at her highest level ever at the same time as going through an intensive master’s program in economics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 12, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/","id":3305,"author":{"id":318,"name":"Duncan MacPhee"},"related":[3304,3303,3302],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
