Already there has been some unexpected wins and losses by various teams, but it’s still too early to determine how the rest of the season will unfold. Now that Week 2 is over, we provide an analysis on some of the NFL’s latest headlines.</p>\n<p><strong>Peyton continues to haunt the Chiefs</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"580457539\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64688\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/broncos/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=1280%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Broncos\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=888%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64688 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=271%2C157\" alt=\"Broncos\" width=\"271\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>I’m sure by now the Kansas City Chiefs’ are wishing they could switch conferences to escape the wrath of Peyton Manning and the havoc he has wreaked on their team over the past decade. Manning is now 14-1 in his career against KC, and joined Hall of Famer Brett Favre as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to throw for more than 70,000 career passing yards. It was an exceptional night from Peyton as he completed 26 of 45 pass attempts, threw for 256 yards, 3 touchdowns, and one pick. However, while Peyton had a milestone night, the Broncos’ defense carried Denver to its victory as they forced three fumbles and had one interception. As if running backs couldn’t receive any more scrutiny after what took place in Seattle and the Meadowlands in Week 1, the shenanigans continued with the Chiefs’ Jamaal Charles. Despite gaining 21 rushing attempts, 125 yards, and one TD, Charles fumbled twice. As we all expected OT, Charles’ hands thought otherwise as he coughed it up with 36 seconds left in regulation which led to the go-ahead scoop and score for the Broncos’ 31-24 win. Sorry Chiefs’ fans, but beating Peyton just might not be meant to be.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Mr. Brady definitely took note of that as he torched Buffalo throwing for 466 yards and three TD’s, the most passing yards allowed in a single-game in Bills history, to lead his team to its 40-32 victory. Apparently the Bills’ needed “King Kong” like Ryan mentioned because the Patriots’ clinic didn’t stop there as “Gronkmania” (yes I just made that up), could not be stopped. Gronkowski had seven receptions to go along with 113 yards and a touchdown. It was a great comeback effort by the Bills, but when your quarterback throws three interceptions against a team, who in my opinion has the best QB in the league, chances are you are going to lose. It’s quite simple: Turnovers = more time for Brady on the field = TD’s for Brady and the Pats.</p>\n<p><strong>Cowboys’ Win, but lose Romo</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"489146748\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/cowboys/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=2000%2C1903&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1903\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cowboys\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=888%2C845&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64678 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=158%2C150\" alt=\"Cowboys\" width=\"158\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=1024%2C974&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Entering this season, many had Head Coach Chip Kelly and the Philadelphia Eagles as the favorites to win the NFC East. But with the Eagles’ sitting at 0-2 after a 20-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, it leaves the door wide open for a 2-0 Dallas team that is eagerly hoping to make a deeper playoff run after nearly making the NFC Championship game last year. It was a fundamental win for the Cowboys as they dominated the time of possession battle, having the ball for 40:30 in comparison to the Eagles’ insufficient time of 19:30. As if things couldn’t get any worse for the Cowboys’ after losing Dez Bryant to a broken foot, the injury troubles continue as quarterback Tony Romo suffered a fractured left collarbone in the third quarter of Sunday’s game. It’s fortunate that Romo doesn’t need surgery to heal the break, but the Cowboys’ Super Bowl chances are definitely slimmer with his absence as he is expected to miss the next eight weeks.

Throwing for 172 yards and two touchdowns off of an 8 for 15 passing night, Manziel played well after a subpar game in Week 1. It seems like he may have found his favorite receiving target in Travis Benjamin, who had three receptions for 115 yards and two TD’s.

With the offseason acquisitions of Frank Gore, Andre Johnson, and more, it’s surprising to see the team that many predicted to play in Santa Clara next February off to another slow start. Unfortunately for Indianapolis, Andrew Luck has yet to play like the “elite” QB he’s labeled to be. He was responsible for four of the team’s five turnovers as he threw three interceptions and lost one fumble. But, recognition must be given to the New York Jets’ defense as it shutout the Colts’ in the first half, and currently lead the NFL in takeaways with 10.  The Jets’ receiving duo of Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker flamed the Colts’ secondary for a combined total of 15 receptions, 198 yards, and two touchdowns. Of course the blame can’t only be n Luck, especially after a costly fumble by Gore at the two-yard line and Indianapolis’ inconsistent play on defense, but as the leader of this franchise Luck must improve his performance on the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Lucky for you, you hit the jackpot. Welcome home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I know it’s an exciting time for you. You’re finally starting to get a taste of what adult life is. You’ve heard the stories about how awesome a party school UCSB is. You’re going to be surrounded by a ridiculous amount of the most beautiful people you’ve ever met, inside and out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It might be tough for you to leave everything you’ve ever known behind – your family and friends, the familiar streets you learned to drive on, your favorite restaurants, your dog – it’s not easy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But what you get in return: the ultimate fresh start.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Forget the ex who cheated on you, the bullies, the dumbasses, the people you’ve been going to school with since kindergarten that still don’t even know your name. Here in SB, we’re all in this together.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Right now, you have the power to control where your life goes. You can go down any path, and many times, you’re going to regret your decisions… Many, many, many times, actually.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But no matter what mistakes you make, never let a bad experience keep you down; learn from it, grow, and do whatever you can to make it a positive influence on your life moving forward.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If there’s one piece of advice I can emphasize more than anything, it is this: always have an open mind. No matter what you’ve thought about something in the past, at the very least, ask yourself “Why?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Why is Friends the greatest show ever? Why am I a Democrat instead of Republican? Why am I against drinking or doing drugs? Why do I believe in God?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Never be afraid of the answers to life’s hardest questions. This is the time for you to learn who you are and what your position is on important issues. As Aristotle once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the end of the day, college is only going to be what you make of it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Okay, now that I’ve imparted some life-changing wisdom that you’ll remember for the rest of your life, it’s time to talk about sports. You may not have seen too much of UCSB on ESPN or anything, but our teams do in fact kick ass.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For example, last season, our men’s volleyball, men’s water polo and baseball teams were ranked as high as No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6 in the nation, respectively.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I’m sure you’ve also heard about our men’s soccer team, which has finished with the No. 1 seed in the Big West in each of the last two seasons.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If you’re going to make it to any one game this season, make sure it’s men’s soccer against Cal Poly. When we hosted them last year, it was in front of the second-largest crowd in NCAA history. And if the image of tortillas flying recklessly through the air in all directions excites you, then you’ll be happy to hear that that’s how we celebrate goals. Make sure you cover your head, though.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, if you want to get in on the sports action yourself, then you’re also in luck. We have an excellent intramural community that gives you fun, organized competition for a large variety of sports and talent levels. You’ll sometimes even have the chance to play with UCSB athletes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For those of you that want to get behind the scenes, interviewing future professional athletes, writing articles about the sports you love and seeing what it’s like to be a journalist, then feel free to either e-mail us or come by the Nexus office and meet either myself or our assistant sports editor, Sean White.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So, with that being said, take a look down below and begin your tour of the teams you’ll be rooting for in the near future.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wishing you a fantastic and successful time here at UCSB,</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Michael J</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Gauchos Do It Better</strong> – Sean White</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you summer for the fun, but it’s time to get back to the grind. Welcome back to all the returning students, and greetings to the new class of freshmen. I hope all of you are ready to embark on your new journey as Gauchos!</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My name is Sean White (yes… almost like the snow/skate boarder) and I am entering my second-year as a Pre-Communication major. This is my second year as a writer and first-year as an editor for the Daily Nexus. I am looking forward to providing UCSB with the best content and coverage of its sports.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It’s crazy that I was just in your position preparing for my first year of college. Trust me, it goes by fast so make sure you enjoy every second of being a Gaucho.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My one suggestion for having a successful school year is simply making sure that you attend as many sporting events as possible. It’s the best way to overcome the stresses of school and take a break from the party scene. When you have teams that are talented and entertaining like UCSB does, it makes college more enjoyable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There’s no one sport at UCSB that I can tell you to commit to because they all have so much to offer. You’ve probably heard that UCSB is only a soccer powerhouse, but don’t let that deceive you. Our school may not receive much attention in mainstream sports headlines, but the experiences and memories gained from any UCSB sporting event are incomparable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While rankings and statistics help measure a team’s capability, it’s the atmosphere and energy of being in the Thunderdome, Harder Stadium, or any other UCSB venue that makes each moment meaningful. Since coming to UCSB, it has been the experience factor that has increased my interest in sports that I did not have much knowledge about.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As an only child, I guess you could call sports that brother or sister that I never had. I was once that kid with dreams of going to the NFL. Although UCSB does not have a football team, attending this school has made me realize how diverse sports are.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Writing for the Nexus has been everything that I hoped to do in my pursuit of a career within sports media and is responsible for my interest in learning more about sports such as volleyball, water polo, soccer, golf, and more. Even if you attend just one game, I hope that at the end of the school year you all can reminisce on the great times you had while cheering for our Gauchos.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With that being said, I hope all of you have a wonderful year. Be sure to follow us on Twitter for everything UCSB sports related: @thenexus_sports.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you,</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sean</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64541\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/2015-sports-editor-welcome-letters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64541\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/2015-sports-editor-welcome-letters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/2015-sports-editor-welcome-letters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/2015-sports-editor-welcome-letters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/2015-sports-editor-welcome-letters/","id":3287,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[3286,3285,3284],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fantasy Sports Island: NFL Week 3","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14-11-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14-11-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As we all rejoice the return of football, NFL Sundays are a lot more entertaining and interactive with the existence of fantasy football.

MLB playoffs are right around the corner, the NBA preseason is just days away from commencing and — most importantly — the NFL is back! That kind of thrill makes me want to do a Cam Newton front flip and scream in honor of America.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the only thing that many would find even more exciting than the NFL season itself is the fact that fantasy football is also back! Thank goodness we all have something to compete in amongst ourselves, because simply watching our teams just isn’t enough anymore. This is especially true for someone like myself who experiences much more success on the fantasy end, as opposed to watching my Eagles sadly stoop to 0-2. As much as I can lament my superbowl-less team, that isn’t why you are all here. Let’s get down to some fantasy, which, despite the name, is very real to us fans.</p>\n<p><strong>Sit and Start</strong><br>\n<em>DeAngelo Williams, RB Pitt</em><br>\nIf you’re a fan of those hard-nosed vets like I am, surely you were excited to see ex-Panther DeAngelo Williams have so much success in Le’Veon Bell’s absence. Unfortunately for DW, this may mean the last time we ever see him get 20 carries, or even 10 for that matter. Bell’s return will strip a significant portion of touches from Williams and, in return, will give Bell a majority of the team’s workload in the backfield. Hopefully, those of you who drafted Williams on your team did not pick him up to be a starting back. Rather, he provides a ton of potential as a backup or even a part-time flex. The man had 204 rush yards and three TD’s in just two games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Matthew Stafford, QB Det </em><br>\nSince 2011, many fantasy owners think of Stafford as a god, when really he is just a guy who’s asked to throw downfield and land the ball somewhere for Calvin Johnson to miraculously make a catch. Although he does put up fantasy numbers, he is not an elite QB and he is very susceptible to even an average pass defense. The Denver Broncos’ secondary and fiesty pass rush he will be facing is far from average. They haven’t allowed a single touchdown pass this year. That being said, Stafford’s matchup does not favor him whatsoever. Bottom line: start your backup this week or go find Cousins, Mariota or Winston on the wire.</p>\n<p><em>Arian Foster, RB Hou</em><br>\nSo you didn’t hear this from me, but Arian is apparently going Kobe on his injury and shattering his recovery records. Let’s just hope he has an easier transition than Kobe did at his ripe old age. Word is that he will suit up this week against Tampa Bay, which has been torn up by the run game so far this season. I would keep an eye on him ’til Sunday morning, but if he is ready, he could be the boost you need this week.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot Off the Wire</strong><br>\n<em>Michael Crabtree, WR Oak (37 percent owned on ESPN platform)</em><br>\nEven a “sorry receiver like Michael Crabtree” has potential to be reborn in a league like this. This is surely possible on a team where he can share the spotlight with a young rookie looking to make a name, and a QB who is determined to be the best of this new young crew of passers in the past couple drafts. Unfortunately for Amari Cooper, he is their number one option, which means he will be on Joe Haden Island this week when they head to Cleveland. Expect Crabtree to be on Derek Carr’s radar all game long. He is likely available in your league.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Jones, RB Was (16.4 percent owned)  </em><br>\nIf you haven’t heard of him already, this rookie back has emerged onto the scene after rushing for 123 yards and two TD’s on 20 carries against a solid Rams defense. Even with Mr. Consistency, Alfred Morris, in front of him there is no way that he will not see the ball this week when they take on the Giants. Morris is still getting his touches, too, so no real loss in value, but it seems there may be a bit more sharing moving forward. This week will be the real stability test for Jones.</p>\n<p><em>Ronnie Hillman, RB Den (49.7 percent owned)</em><br>\nHillman has potential to be a great back but it is more so the struggles of CJ Anderson that will draw Ronnie’s name this week. The Broncos play in the motor city this week, and it will be a perfect time to test out Hillman’s wheels and see if he is the guy they would like to move forward with. This is your guy if you’re too impatient for CJ, Demarco Murray, or Jeremy Hill to start doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by the island this week!

Not only is it the most exciting and highly anticipated weekend of the year for many football fans, but it’s also the most difficult to predict. Most teams haven’t had any real competitive action since the previous calendar year, and many have  since dramatically revamped their starting lineups. But with Week 1 now in the books, let’s take a look at some of the top storylines we’ve witnessed at this early point.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1801475155\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64682\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/pats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64682 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=222%2C222\" alt=\"Pats\" width=\"222\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Cheater or not, Brady’s still going to beat you</strong><br>\nThis lesson has been learned time and time again when it comes to the Patriots. It doesn’t matter who is surrounding Tom Brady, more times than not, he’s going to win. Whether he’s throwing to Deion Branch and Troy Brown, Randy Moss and Wes Welker, or Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, the result is usually the same. With the climax of Deflate-Gate finally having passed and Brady’s four-game suspension being nullified, the two-time NFL MVP happily accepted his fourth Super Bowl ring before walking all over the Pittsburgh Steelers to the tune of a 25-32, 288 yard, four TD passing night. Maybe the Patriots’ history of getting caught cheating made it easy to silence all the noise surrounding them? Whatever the case, Brady showed us last Thursday that another tally in the old age category hasn’t slowed him down at all.

The following year, he kicked off the greatest offensive campaign in NFL history by throwing an NFL record-tying seven TDs in a 49-27 demolition of the defending champion Ravens. Last year, more of the same against his old Colts, throwing no picks for the third straight opener to go along with three six-pointers and a 31-24 win.</p>\n<p>This past Sunday against Baltmore, well, Peyton didn’t look quite like Peyton. He missed open receivers down the field on more than one occasion and the only touchdown he threw was to Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith. I’m not saying that we’re going to be seeing a drop in production of Kobe Bryant proportions from Manning this season, but I am saying that this is definitely not the same guy who I did my “Make a Puppet of your Favorite Hero Project” on in sixth grade, let alone the guy who broke every single-season offensive record in the book just TWO seasons ago. If his defense can keep playing this way though, I’m still picking the orange-haired horses to win the AFC West. #vinoclub</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1609167954\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/cowboys/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=2000%2C1903&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1903\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cowboys\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=888%2C845&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64678 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=136%2C129\" alt=\"Cowboys\" width=\"136\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=1024%2C974&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Dez Bryant out 4-6 weeks</strong><br>\nDez may or may not have “caught the ball” (yeah, he caught it) against the Green Bay Packers in last year’s NFC Championship game, but this past weekend he did indeed catch a broken foot to go along with his five receptions.

Give the man the ball, he’s hungry!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1342066757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64687\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/bills/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bills\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64687 alignleft\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=67%2C67\" alt=\"Bills\" width=\"67\" height=\"67\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 67px) 100vw, 67px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Defense, Defense, Defense</strong><br>\nDespite new starting runningback LeSean “Shady” McCoy carrying 17 times for only 41 yards, Head Coach Rex Ryan’s debut goes well as the Buffalo Bills open up a 21-0 lead over Andrew Luck and the Colts on their way to an impressive season-opening win.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"488584061\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64677\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/chargers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?fit=369%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"369,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Chargers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?fit=369%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright wp-image-64677\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?resize=170%2C92\" alt=\"Chargers\" width=\"170\" height=\"92\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?w=369&amp;ssl=1 369w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Bolts overcome huge deficit at home</strong><br>\nAfter going down 21-3 to the Detroit Lions, Philip Rivers and co. put up 30 straight points on their way to a 33-28 win.
