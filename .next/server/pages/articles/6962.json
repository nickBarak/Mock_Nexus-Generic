Our music tastes and the bands we listen to closely reflect who we are as people. The soundtracks of our lives are what get us through happiness, sadness and anger, and sharing our favorite songs makes us feel as if we are entrusting someone with a part of us. It allows two people to better understand each other. It gives the message of saying, “Hey, this song says something about me. Maybe you feel the same way I do?”</p>\n<p>While music can serve as a link to connect with others better, it has the ability to make one emotionally attach a song to a specific memory or person. At times, music is like time-travel because of its ability to evoke unsolicited emotions. One day, you’re walking to class and you hear someone blasting a song you once shared with someone you loved and suddenly your body freezes up. Why does this happen? Is it nostalgia? Bitterness? Longing?</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Charles Mullin, professor of Media Entertainment in UCSB’s Communication Department, “The relationship between music and memory and emotion has intrigued scholars for a very long time now, and seems to be getting even more attention nowadays as researchers are applying a better understanding of the psychobiological mechanisms involved.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The pervasiveness of music has increased to be much more than just something one listens to in their free time. It has lyrics that influence the world. It’s the voice that understands, and it’s the friend that pumps you up to be excited by life. It’s everywhere — in concerts, radio, TV shows, your iPod when you’re walking to class.</p>\n<p>“People nowadays can take their music with them at all times and can enjoy it privately (courtesy of mp3 players and other new-ish technologies). People are particularly able to cultivate a ‘soundtrack’ for their lives,” Mullin said.</p>\n<p>Once a friendship or relationship is over, one can put concrete things like books and pictures away, but it’s much harder to separate something as intangible as music. Dr. Mullin explains the reason for this.</p>\n<p>“Music-related memories are probably a little different than other types of emotional memories in that they are often social in nature, linked to a social context or social relationship,” he said. Because of the countless memories of the songs you listened to together in the car, sharing music seems to suddenly be tainted with feelings you would like to forget.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>BREAKUP BLUES</strong></p>\n<p>Kaylyn Harris, a second-year biology major, identifies with Maroon 5’s music, confessing that almost all their songs seem to chronicle her love life entirely.</p>\n<p>“When I ended a two-year relationship, it was around the same time that ‘Payphone’ came out. When you’re 14-to-16 years old, a ‘happy ever after did exist’ is the only thing you know. Last summer we started talking again, and that’s around the time ‘Maps’ came out. It described my situation perfectly,” Harris recalled.</p>\n<p>The catchy, but heart-breaking Maroon 5 song Harris refers to is about a person who misses their old love and the conversations they used to have, but later realizes that they shouldn’t feel that way because they weren’t there for each other through their darkest times. Because song lyrics oftentimes fit into personal experiences, many people can allow themselves to feel understood and less alone through music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>SOMBER SOUNDS </strong></p>\n<p>Ever had a time in your life you just felt so down that you couldn’t get out of bed? You are definitely not alone. Just when you feel like there’s no one in the world who could comprehend you, you listen to an artist croon in heartbreakingly beautiful ways that transcend conversation.</p>\n<p>Aimee Wong, a fourth-year psychology and English major, listens to certain artists in order to feel understood.</p>\n<p>“I like listening to acoustic music when I’m sad from singer-songwriters like Ben Howard or from LIGHTS’ acoustic album,” Wong said. “I feel like the simple acoustic tones of their guitar and their voice helps resonate with something deeper than what I could put into words.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>HAPPY TUNES</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to acting as emotional catharsis, music can be enjoyable and reassuring. Shomik Mukherjee, a first-year English major, finds his favorite songs comforting to identify with personally.</p>\n<p>“I really enjoy the song ‘Subterranean Homesick Alien’ by Radiohead,” Mukherjee said. “The lyrics are just brilliant, and the feeling of isolation the lead singer, Thom Yorke, describes is universal. It’s very comforting to identify with at times, and on more difficult days, he can be really soothing even as he gets more and more emotive with his voice. Of course, on happier days, it’s easy to just appreciate it as a wonderful piece of music.”</p>\n<p>Because music serves as a link to deeper connections — sometimes fun, sometimes meaningful and other times hard to bear — everyone has a different relationship with the music that they play. Music has the ability to speak what words can’t. It’s a bridge for understanding, a connection that unknowingly binds humans to their memories and emotions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div

and writer Mollie Gregory to a large gathering of nearly 200 attendees at last weekend’s 11th Women’s Literary Festival (WLF), an event held annually in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>If that sounds dangerous — and confusing since the audience was primarily comprised of readers and writers — it is. While Gregory quoted a stuntwoman, she believes it also applies to the world of scribing. One needs confidence to boost creativity and strong determination to turn obstacles into opportunities, especially if you’re a woman trying to advance a career.</p>\n<p>And that’s the focus of the festival where women writers from all walks of life and ethnicities come together to support their work in promoting social justice, sharing insights and skills to hone their writing and celebrating their creativity and achievements.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Co-founder Sharon Hoshida welcomed WLF participants to the Fess Parker hotel with a salute to the power of words.</p>\n<p>“Forming the words, giving them sound … it unleashes the power of the imagination, the creative spirit, touching the collective consciousness, moving the mind and the emotions into a rhythm of solidarity and oneness,” Hoshida said. “That is what we are here today to do, to savor and enjoy together.”</p>\n<p>The festival began with renowned journalist and award-winning author Ann Louise Bardach, who exemplifies fearlessness with her successful pursuit interviews with the elusive Cuban leader Fidel Castro for <em>Vanity Fair</em>. She has also produced other high-profile stories on Cuba-Miami political affairs for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The</em> <em>Atlantic</em> and was featured on NPR, <em>60 Minutes</em> and other broadcast programs.</p>\n<p>Bardach understood that, as a journalist, one must be a good writer and a good detective, something she discovered when interviewing Marita Lorenz, a woman involved in an affair with and an assassination attempt on Castro.</p>\n<p>“First of all, you’re always dealing with smoke and mirrors at a level you’ve never dealt with,” Bardach said, “and almost all Cuban stories are partially true. There’s a large part that isn’t true, and it’s your job as a reporter to figure this out.”</p>\n<p>Crime fiction author Kelli Stanley concurred with Bardach’s insight because she tackles “smoke and mirrors” on a daily basis through her Miranda Corbie series of 1940 San Francisco noir novels and short stories.</p>\n<p>Though Stanley’s novels are crime thrillers, they essentially deal with those on society’s margins who are voiceless. She credits this inspiration to her working class background as daughter of a man who was a son of a coal miner and a woman whose mother left school at 12 to become a factory worker.</p>\n<p>“The ’40s I wanted to write about is a ’40s of people who don’t have a voice,” Stanley said, “who do not get called the ‘greatest generation,’ who get shoved aside in our yen to put on rose-colored glasses for this particular period of time.”</p>\n<p>Thus, Stanley created Miranda Corbie, a private investigator with the ability to move between worlds and classes of people separated by economic divides. But more than moving across barriers in pursuit of social justice, Miranda also breaks some of her own as a female detective.</p>\n<p>“With Miranda, my goal in the face of every rerun of <em>Double Indemnity </em>and just about every book James M. Cain wrote, which are all pretty misogynistic, I wanted to flip noir itself on its ear,” Stanley said. “I wanted to take a woman who had every aspect of a femme fatale — from being sexual to being smart, strong, successful, ambitious and knowing it — characteristics that have been demonized in Western literature, and, instead of being the root of all evil, I wanted to make her the hero.”</p>\n<p>Notions of diversity in voice and experience continued to reverberate after Stanley’s talk in a breakout session involving filmmaker and writer Grace DeSoto Ferry, whose humorous and nostalgic works illustrate the struggles of growing up Mexican in San Antonio, and poet and artist Angela Peñaredondo whose writings draw upon multi-cultural experiences of moving back and forth between another country and the homeland.</p>\n<p>Also included in the breakout session was writer and illustrator of children’s literature Kathryn Otoshi, who discussed how her background as a graphic designer and multimedia art director in the film industry informs the drawings in her books. After working for companies such as Robert Zemeckis’s ImageMovers and George Lucas’s Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Otoshi began to see books as mini-films.</p>\n<p>“If you think about it, there’s this opportunity to be the set production designer where the backgrounds need to be created,” Otoshi said. “You’re directing the actors and sometimes you need to do it over and over because it’s not right, so you’re doing take one, take two, take three. And when you turn the page, that’s like a cut in a scene, so you suddenly become the editor.”</p>\n<p>Though Otoshi’s illustrations may be as simple as color blobs and numbers, their messages of using empowerment and self-confidence to overcome self-doubt and bullying run deep with Otoshi’s ability to create tone and attitude in simplicity. While reading through her works, she asked attendees to pretend they were back in sixth grade and led them through exercises designed to engage children such as spreading their arms high above the head, making a circle, then bringing it in front of them.</p>\n<p>“Pretend it’s a magnifying glass,” Otoshi said. “Past skin and bones and your clothing lives something called your character: Bravery, courage, kindness and being thoughtful, responsible, respectful and honest lives in here. The goal is to fill it up, up, up with all these things until it gets so full it overflows. And that’s how we can stand up straight and tall again.”</p>\n<p>Following the morning discussions on arts and media, UCLA Associate Professor of Chican@ and African American Studies Gaye Theresa Johnson transported the audience to the idea of space in terms of social justice.</p>\n<p>Johnson’s works explore topics of civil rights, activism and spatial struggles, particularly how occupying space can signal presence, how power involves controlling space and how people can render certain spaces as meaningful.</p>\n<p>She presented a vast narrative of those affected by gentrification, poverty lines, segregation, immigrant detention and mass incarceration. These developments, she emphasized, are often either ignored or scantily reported in the media due to a lack of meaningful engagement to really understand what these issues are truly about.</p>\n<p>“Writers have to be good listeners,” Johnson said. “It’s often very difficult to listen to the stories that don’t have neat resolutions like the ones that we’re paid to write about, but this is something that brings us back to this notion of community-engaged writing, because we have to look at these bigger struggles.”</p>\n<p>Gregory, who succeeded Johnson, certainly embodies the quality of a good listener through her nonfiction works, <em>Women Who Run the Show: How A Brilliant and Creative New Generation Stormed Hollywood </em>and <em>Stuntwomen: The Untold Hollywood Story</em>, detailing the lives of professional women in the entertainment industry. In addition to the risks involved (especially regarding stunt work), these women are often faced with limited job opportunities, unequal pay and sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>“We were in a war!” one interviewee told Gregory, which inspired her to title major sections of <em>Women Who Run the Show </em>in military terms. Part One was titled “The Beachhead: an area on hostile shores seized and defended to secure further landing of troops and supplies.”</p>\n<p>From these interviews, Gregory learned that these perilous challenges are more than just women trying to break into a “boys’ club” sector or crashing through windows; they also help build characters and confidence, which apply to everyone in different ways. And the real hazards are the good risks not taken.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s investigating social issues as a journalist and academic or exploring their themes through symbolic illustrations, expressive words and detective characters, the WLF not only celebrated the achievements and triumphs of equality but also highlighted the work left to do.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Over 50 people gathered in Anisq’Oyo’ Park last Saturday to indulge in the 2016 Wordstock Music Festival presented by <em>WORD</em>, the Isla Vista arts and culture magazine. Whether it was braiding friendship bracelets or dancing to local group Poster Child’s cover of “Hotline Bling,” Wordstock demonstrates that there’s more culture to I.V. than its oft-prevailing perception of a madhouse party scene.</p>\n<p>“I think that <em>WORD</em> brings a new perspective to Isla Vista and UCSB,” magazine writer Sarah Scarminach said. “It is an arts and culture magazine, but the magazine shows a lot of lesser known aspects of I.V.

Scurrying through the festival, both literally and figuratively, was <em>WORD</em>’s unofficial mascot. Not only was the critter materialized via a mask consisting of a white foam cup and a paper plate (worn by illustrator Sonam Zahrt-Tenzin), but it also appeared on the cover of the Spring 2016 issue, <em>WORD</em>’s hand screen-printed t-shirts and the backdrop of the photo booth.</p>\n<p>“It seems like a cross between a mascot and a running gag,” Chun said when asked about the story behind the raccoon. “We’ve had a column in, I think, every issue called “The Albino Raccoon,” and one of those is on the cover of the spring issue.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, <em>WORD</em>’s “The Albino Raccoon” of spring 2016 featured JàNae Powell’s “Being Black on a Campus That Isn’t.” In addition to this, the zine contained articles ranging from one writer’s “friendship experiments,” a defense of Planned Parenthood, and a photo series on ballerinas of I.V.; issue 28 highlights multiple compelling topics and an array of talent.</p>\n<p>Sam Arrow, co-editor of <em>WORD</em>, acknowledges the magazine’s importance as a creative outlet for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of artists and writers who don’t really have a lot of other opportunities to do what it is that they do for <em>WORD</em>, especially given the S.T.E.M.-focused nature of UCSB,” Arrow said. “The issues that we produce are always free and pretty accessible, so I guess there is an obvious entertainment aspect in that.”</p>\n<p>Encompassing the motley culture of Isla Vista while simultaneously spotlighting unique experiences is no easy feat. Individual stories often fall to the wayside amidst mainstream attitudes toward I.V. and UCSB, but <em>WORD</em>’s commitment to showcasing an assortment of diverse voices reverberated throughout Wordstock and gave residents a chance to engross themselves in the community.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/wordstock-shows-colors-of-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/wordstock-shows-colors-of-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/wordstock-shows-colors-of-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/wordstock-shows-colors-of-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/wordstock-shows-colors-of-i-v/","id":6960,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6959,6958,6957],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"5 Rock Bands Your Dad Loves and You Should, Too","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?resize=570%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the Doors are the definition of amazing, awesome and astonishing music.

If you don’t already know this, then please go back and hide under the rock from which you came. As a reasonably cultured human, you might be itching to dive deeper into the cream of the crop and to expand or rediscover your repertoire of the greatest artists to grace society’s eardrums. For you, good soul, this reporter (with the help of his dad) created a succulent list of sweet, juicy rock bands. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><strong>Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young:</strong> This band is revolutionary. Their song “Ohio” had a tremendous influence in the political environment and popular culture at the beginning of the ’70s. “Ohio” might be the most poignant, politically-charged song of the time. The lyrics express the blatant truth of government killing their own citizens in the Kent State shootings — what is more incendiary than that? Aside from their activism, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young also wrote entrancing songs with high vocals that are positively elating. I dare you to try to have a bad time while blasting “Suite Judy Blue Eyes.” You’d have to be a hamster in a dryer to not love this song.</p>\n<p><strong>Steely Dan:</strong> These guys deserve a seriously good listen just because of the hilarious origin of their name. According to Steely Dan’s website, the band founders were avid readers of the Beatniks and “decided to name the band “Steely Dan” after a dildo in William Burroughs’ <em>Naked Lunch.</em></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Besides the thrill of their raunchy name, Steely Dan has a tone that is unparalleled in its longevity and brilliance.

You could find someone that could play faster or do some stupid tricks, but nobody plays slide guitar with more heart than Allman. “Statesboro Blues” sounds as if he’s using his heart as the slide; his antics are so ferociously smooth that his strings must be lubricated in his own blood. The zing and electricity that Allman pulls out of a Les Paul with his hands is so blissful that you’ll feel your own fingers tingling.</p>\n<p><strong>The Grateful Dead:</strong> The Grateful Dead is an all-time band. If you want to get psychedelic, man, you’ve found the band. This group demands your full attention, regardless of whether or not you’re strung out and stoned. The most common doctor recommendation for listening is getting absolutely blasted, lighting a few candles or incense and watching hours of live footage. The Dead were known for their entrancing live performances and long winding jams. Take some time to explore the music and let it unravel your innermost thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>The Doobie Brothers:</strong> The Doobie Brothers got soul. Their pure sound brings you back to your roots and home. This is the band that you’ll want to play if you’re trying to get your romance on under the California sun. You know, that good slow love that happens while you’re dancing on tables on a bright spring day. Songs like “Listen to the Music” and “Black Water” make the perfect backdrop for barbecuing with some good friends and a few cold ones. Plus the group has the word “doobie” in their name, so spark it, brah! (Disclaimer, drugs are bad, mmk?)</p>\n<p><em>Ryan Mandell and his dad — who still parties, kind of — know good music.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62786\" style=\"width: 580px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"337231783\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62785\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62786\" data-attachment-id=\"62786\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/5-rock-bands-your-dad-loves-and-you-should-too/dad-bands-natalie-obrien/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?fit=570%2C748&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"570,748\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dad Bands – Natalie O’Brien\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?fit=191%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?fit=570%2C748&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62786\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?resize=570%2C748\" alt=\"Natalie O'Brien / Daily Nexus\" width=\"570\" height=\"748\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dad-Bands-Natalie-OBrien.jpg?resize=191%2C250&amp;ssl=1 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62786\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Natalie O’Brien</em> / <em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62785\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/5-rock-bands-your-dad-loves-and-you-should-too/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62785\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/5-rock-bands-your-dad-loves-and-you-should-too/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/5-rock-bands-your-dad-loves-and-you-should-too/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/5-rock-bands-your-dad-loves-and-you-should-too/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/5-rock-bands-your-dad-loves-and-you-should-too/","id":6961,"author":{"id":745,"name":"Ryan Mandell"},"related":[6960,6959,6958],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
