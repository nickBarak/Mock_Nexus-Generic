UCSB has gone 3-2 in those games.</p>\n<p>Tuesday night on the road at Pepperdine was no exception as UCSB overcame a 14-point first-half deficit to earn the 77-69 victory and the team’s second consecutive road win.</p>\n<p>“It was good for us to finally find ways to win. That’s going to be big for us because we do have a bit of inexperience on this team and as we continue to do that it will really help us,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We just battled. We had a tough first half and we could have quit after that, but we kept at it and knew what we had to do to pull that win out.”</p>\n<p>For the second straight game, Nesbit set a new career high, totaling 26 points on 8-15 shooting. This season, she averages 18.6 points per game and has been extremely efficient, shooting 47.9 percent from the field, including 51.9 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>All three seniors have been critical for the Gauchos this season with senior guard Destini Mason averaging 15.9 points and a team-leading 6.7 rebounds per game and senior guard Melissa Zornig averaging 12.6 points and a team-high 3.6 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with the seniors pulling their weight, Mitchell was waiting for one more player to step up. Against Pepperdine, Santa Barbara received that bench production, with junior guard Kristine Brance giving eight second-half points and five rebounds and sophomore guard Jasmine Ware tallying six points and providing plenty of defensive pressure. This allowed Mitchell to give her seniors a few extra minutes of rest, which is crucial with so many games in such a small period of time.</p>\n<p>“[Tuesday] we were able to trust Kris, Jasmine and [freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright] to give us at least 10 or 15 minutes and produce while they were out there, so I think that was instrumental,” Mitchell said. “It’s critical any time you can get Nic, Mel and Destini to be around the 30-minute mark. That only helps their production and will help us down the road as far as their legs and how many minutes we may need them to play down the stretch.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns home tonight with a 4-3 overall record. NAU, meanwhile, comes to the Thunderdome with a 1-2 mark.</p>\n<p>While the Lumberjacks are a balanced team, they should be a good matchup for the Gauchos as NAU lacks the height UCSB has seen in its last few games.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team,” Nesbit said. “They don’t have as much size as we’ve seen in the past, but they have thicker guards that are going to be more physical and I’m sure will try to post us up. We’re going to see a bit of a different team than we have in the past.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Amanda Frost anchors Northern Arizona’s offense, averaging 21.7 points per game. In the team’s most recent victory over Utah Valley, Frost went off for 30 points.</p>\n<p>Another key matchup for UCSB will be junior forward Erikka Banks, who grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds in the team’s win. On the year, she averages a double-double with 10.3 points and 12.7 boards.</p>\n<p>“Banks is an interesting match-up because she’s 6’0’’, but she’s really a guard averaging 13 rebounds a game. She’s just a competitor,” Mitchell said. “Frost I would probably relate to Mel. She can shoot it, she can put it on the floor, and then around the basket she has euro step throughs, so she scores in a variety of ways.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, rebounding will be important for UCSB tomorrow A statistic that consistently predicts the result on the scoreboard, the Gauchos average 38.2 rebounds when they win compared to 25.3 boards when they lose.</p>\n<p>The other key factor for Santa Barbara will be turnovers. This season, UCSB averages an impressive 12.6 giveaways per game. On the other hand, the Gauchos would like to take advantage of the Lumberjacks’ turnovers as Northern Arizona has struggled with throwing the ball away, averaging 20 per game in its three games so far.</p>\n<p>“We’re making less mental mistakes,” Nesbit said. “Being aggressive, the turnovers we can live with are the ones in transition where you try to make something happen, but I think we’re starting to limit the unforced turnovers that happen for no reason. We’re playing a bit smarter and that’s something that’s really valuable for us right now.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>At 6’4’’, senior center Cierra Warren dominated the small Gauchos squad, scoring 21 points and a game-high seven rebounds on 9-10 shooting from the field. One of eight players on the roster listed at six feet or taller, she led SDSU to a phenomenal 65.9 percent shooting performance from the field, including 70.6 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>Down four, Warren stepped outside and knocked down a three to bring her team within one at 45-44. She went on to score San Diego State’s next eight points to give the Aztecs a one point advantage just over halfway through the second half.</p>\n<p>“[Warren] started out at North Carolina. We know she could’ve played anywhere in the country,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’ll have to go back and look at when she scored and how she scored. If we were in man, really the only body type that could match up against her was Big Mel.”</p>\n<p>Despite the Aztec shooting percentage, the Gauchos’ three point shooting kept them in the game. Ranked last in the Big West in threes with just 16 on the year entering the game, UCSB made over half its season total in one game, shooting nine of 19 from behind the arc for 47.4 percent.</p>\n<p>“We were getting wide open looks, but I think more towards the second half, we were taking shots too quickly and weren’t attacking as much as we should have,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “The mentality we should have had from the beginning was to attack.”</p>\n<p>The supremacy by both teams in their respective styles led to a game that would be decided in the final seconds.</p>\n<p>Down six with a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig hit a three to bring the game within one possession. A steal on the inbounds and a converted layup from Nesbit completed a five-point swing, making a game that seemed over anybody’s game.</p>\n<p>“We were just trying to pressure it,” Zornig said. “We wanted to get the ball back. We wanted to press them and see what we could do with it.”</p>\n<p>In its full court press, UCSB forced SDSU to travel and was given the opportunity to take the lead with 48.5 seconds left in the game, but could not create a good shot on the offensive end. On the miss, Santa Barbara was forced to foul and freshman guard Ariell Bostick made one of two free throws to put her team up three.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, Nesbit, who had been hot from distance at 5-7 from behind the arc at the time, received an open look from the left wing, but the three bounced off the back of the iron.</p>\n<p>“We drew it up and knew we needed a look at a three,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the first shot, so Mel came in. She took a look at it and then I did get a good look. We did get the look we wanted. It just didn’t go in.”</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs improve to 1-4, the Gauchos drop to 3-3.</p>\n<p>“With the competitor I am, it’s disappointing to know that’s their first win of the season. That’s frustrating when you’re at home,” Mitchell said. “We had our opportunities. We went into halftime up six and we turned stagnant against that two-three zone (in the second half) and it cost us.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB shot 52.0 percent on the game and had three players in double-figures. Nesbit finished with a game-high and career-high 22 points while senior guard Destini Mason and Zornig tallied with 20 and 14 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We had three players in double figures, but again, it’s our guards,” Mitchell said. “We have to find someone else to give us a scoring punch so [the seniors] don’t have to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to rebound quickly from the loss as they travel to Pepperdine Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53343\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53343\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/","id":587,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[586,585,584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels South to Face Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos try to rebound from 71-67 loss to SDSU tonight against Pepperdine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team’s ability to have short term memory will be tested this week.</p>\n<p>Just three days off a rough loss to San Diego State, the Gauchos play Pepperdine on the road tonight, the first of two games in the next three days.</p>\n<p>“We take each game game by game,” freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “It sucks to lose, but we have to let it go and move forward because we do have other games.

Even then, senior guard Nicole Nesbit was given a wide-open three to tie the game in the few second remaining, but missed.</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team with a career-high 22 points. Moving over to the shooting guard position this season, Nesbit currently ranks third in the Big West in scoring with 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“When you play the point, the mentality is to pass first, shoot second,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Onome’s thought process is to dribble penetrate and get everyone else involved, so that frees up Nic and allows her to have legs late in the game because she’s not having to handle the ball against pressure for 40 minutes. In critical moments, she knows and understands we want the ball in her hands.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB shot a season-high 9-19 from three point range, in the second half, the team began settling for jumpers instead of attacking the rim, playing into the tactics of the Aztecs, who played a zone defense.</p>\n<p>Tonight, Santa Barbara will see a zone once again against Pepperdine, who will look to pack the paint.</p>\n<p>“Zones are so different for people and sometimes I smile and sometimes I want to pull my hair out because when you have players that can dribble penetrate and can shoot, they have all the different elements, but there’s something about a zone that sometimes makes them hesitant,” Mitchell said. “When you’re playing one on one or man defense, it’s a lot easier to use your skill or ability to either create your own shot or create for others. Zones make everyone have to be on the same page.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine enters tonight’s matchup at 2-5. Losers of four straight games, all of which were on the road, the Waves return home in need of a victory.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good team. We have seen some very talented individuals so far, but I think Pepperdine is the team that is the best overall team in understanding their roles and playing well together,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced, play inside-out, they have skilled players as well as athletes, and they’re battle-tested. They played Oregon and UCLA close; they’ve won on the road in Seattle.”</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos will keep an eye on defensively is junior guard Bria Richardson. Pepperdine’s leading scorer in five of its seven games, Richardson averages 16.6 points, 5.3 assists and 2.6 steals per contest.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at Firestone Fieldhouse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53346\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53346\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/","id":588,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[587,586,585],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Cal For First Time Since 1979","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-18.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-18.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts Cal on Friday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After falling to UCLA in a competitive game on Tuesday, the UCSB men’s basketball team will face yet another tough opponent when it hosts Cal tomorrow at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the matchup with a 3-3 record after falling to the No. 19 Bruins 89-76.

With Williams, Santa Barbara is 3-1, the lone loss coming to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“We’re encouraged by the fact that we can compete in a game like this in the future. We had a good shot at putting them away and getting the upset,” Boswell said. “We have to take out the positive things because we have a huge game on Friday against Cal coming to our place. We just know that we can play with anyone and we’ve proven that this year.”</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, UCSB did not look like a team from a smaller conference facing a power conference team. Instead, Santa Barbara battled for the majority of the game, taking a 42-42 tie into the half at legendary Pauley Pavilion. UCSB even led in the second half before a run by the Bruins put the game out of reach. Big Al led the Gauchos with 23 points to go along with eight rebounds, but the outside shooting of UCSB was the real storyline in this game.</p>\n<p>Boswell finished with 18 points shooting 5-9 from behind the arc. Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Bryson and junior guard Zalmico Harmon each shot 3-5 from the three while sophomore forward Taran Brown was 2-6. Overall, UCSB shot 50 percent on threes, including an impressive 9-14 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of good shooters on the perimeter surrounding Al down low, so if we’re not hitting threes and having people close down on us hard, we’re going to go inside,” Boswell said. “If we go inside and they’re doubling Al, we’re going to kick it out. We have a lot of inside-outside game that we pride ourselves on, especially with two quick point guards that can get into the lane.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to another Pac-12 opponent, UCSB hosts a Golden Bears’ squad that defeated Big West team UC Irvine 73-56 on Monday. Senior guard Justin Cobbs leads Cal with 14 points and over six assists per game. Senior forward Richard Solomon will provide a formidable opponent down low against Big Al, as the senior averages a double-double with over 11 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly has the weapons to challenge the Golden Bears, led by Big Al’s Big West leading numbers of 27.5 points, 10.8 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. Bryson ranks second on the team with 12.7 points per game, while Boswell is third at 11 points and Brown fourth at 10.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup against Cal looms as the Gauchos biggest nonconference home game of the season.</p>\n<p>“[A victory against Cal] would be huge. UCLA was a really big team and that just showed us just how dominant Big Al is,” Boswell said. “We nearly beat Utah State and Colorado even without Al, so the fact that he’s going to be a presence on Friday, they’re going to have to pick their spots. He’s going to cause a lot of problems for Cal so hopefully we’ll take advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s tip-off against Cal is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53348\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53348\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/","id":589,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[588,587,586],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
