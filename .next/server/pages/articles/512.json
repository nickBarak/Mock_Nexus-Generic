Led by a game-high 20 points from junior guard Michael Bryson, the Gauchos defeated the Mustangs 91-45.</p>\n<p>UCSB picks up its first win of the season and is now 1-2 overall while The Master’s College drops its record to 2-1. The victory was much needed for Santa Barbara who came up empty on its two-game road trip against Kansas and Florida Gulf Coast University, despite each being close contests.</p>\n<p>“We have a little streak going on now,” Bryson said. “We don’t have these two losses sitting on our backs. Whether or not it’s a bad team or not, getting a win is getting a win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB controlled the game from the beginning and jumped out to a 14-4 lead in large part to its shooting. The Gauchos suffered from a shooting slump in their first two games, but it was a completely different story against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara closed out the half leading 47-22 with the team making 52 percent of its shots from the field and going 5-8 from three-point range. Bryson scored 14 of his 20 points in the half, with him shooting an efficient 3-5 from long distance; in previous games, he averaged 25 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the half, UCSB wasted no time putting away its opponent and jumped out to a 17-1 run in the beginning minutes. The Master’s College best player, senior guard Russell Byrd, was bottled up by the Gaucho defense. Byrd was limited to 20 points and five rebounds, however, the defense forced him to turn the ball over 11 times.</p>\n<p>Having a significant advantage rebounding and shooting well, the Gauchos led the game by as much as 34 points midway through the second half, eventually putting the contest out of reach.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did several things pretty good,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We shot the ball well, we moved the ball well and we pretty much took advantage of them on the glass rebounding the ball well.”</p>\n<p>Unlike in previous games, senior center Alan Williams had a relatively quiet game, finishing with 12 points and eight rebounds. Instead, the Gauchos relied on Big Al drawing the defense and serving as a distributor.</p>\n<p>“They doubled down on [Williams] so much that he was able to find us and we were able to shoot well,” Bryson said. “The ball is going to go through him and we’re going to get good looks out of him because he’s the best player in the league.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard John Green continues showing what he can contribute when healthy. Green scored 14 points, second most on the team, to go along with seven rebounds. Green’s scrappy defense and ability to shoot jumpers and take the ball inside were seen when he was on the court. It marked Green’s third game of the season, one game shy of his total games played his previous three years on the team.</p>\n<p>“I feel better than ever,” Green said. “I worked really hard working off my injuries … It’s just a good feeling to contribute.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard DaJuan Smith started the game in place of the injured freshman guard Gabe Vincent, who was held off because of a blister injury on his foot. Smith made the most of his start and scored seven points, but was the main ball facilitator with seven assists on the night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara plays again beginning Thursday in the Great Alaska Shootout, a three-game tournament featuring eight programs. UCSB’s first matchup is against Pac-12 team, Washington State. The game will be played in the Alaska Airlines Center in Anchorage.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58772\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/ucsbs-shooting-overwhelms-mustangs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58772\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/ucsbs-shooting-overwhelms-mustangs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/ucsbs-shooting-overwhelms-mustangs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/ucsbs-shooting-overwhelms-mustangs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/ucsbs-shooting-overwhelms-mustangs/","id":512,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[511,510,509],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Women’s Basketball: Returning to Dominance","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1.18.2013.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.Cal_.St_.Northridge-18.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1.18.2013.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.Cal_.St_.Northridge-18.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a Difficult Season, UCSB Brings in Five Recruits to Become a Defensive-Minded Team Once Again","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>If there is one thing associated with the UCSB women’s basketball team, it’s winning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have dominated the Big West, owning the highest Big West winning percentage of any current conference team and the most league championships.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has expected no less in the first three years of the Carlene Mitchell Era, as UCSB went to the NCAA Tournament her first year in Santa Barbara and made the postseason her first two years ever as a head coach.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

\r\n</script> \n<p>However, this season was very different in what was a season of struggle for the Gauchos. Finishing the year at just 8-22 overall and 3-13 in conference play, Santa Barbara barely qualified for the Big West Tournament, losing to UC Davis in the first round.</p>\n<p>In that loss, UCSB’s seniors scored every point in the second-half comeback. Losing its entire starting backcourt to graduation, the Gauchos will miss the majority of its scoring as senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason accounted for 64.3 percent of the team’s offense.</p>\n<p>All three averaged double-digit scoring for Santa Barbara and were the only players to do so. Nesbit and Zornig both hit the 1,000-point career milestone this season and were named All-Big West Honorable Mention selections.</p>\n<p>“They understand that they’re not going to be remembered by their last record. All of them left here better players,” Mitchell said. “All have signed with agents and will have a chance to play in Europe.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Santa Barbara does return seven players. In fact, its two returning starters are at the two positions most difficult to replace. Next season, freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe will return as a sophomore after being named to the Big West All-Freshmen team this season and averaging 5.8 points and 2.2 assists while running the show for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Playing center, junior Clair Watkins will play her first full season with the Gauchos after joining the team in December this season. Watkins found her stride toward the end of the year, averaging 8.6 points and 8.4 rebounds in the last seven games.</p>\n<p>Along with junior guard Kristine Brance, Watkins will be expected to be the leader of next year’s squad.</p>\n<p>“I think our upperclassmen have had a great postseason and have worked harder than any group in my three years here,” Mitchell said. “Some of that you can talk up to the bitter taste we had in our mouth. Now they realize you have three senior guards leaving and someone has to step up. I’ve told Clair she has the ability to be one of the best post players in the conference. When she’s willing to step up and carry that burden, then we’ll be a big-time team.”</p>\n<p>While Mitchell looks to replace the offense lost from the graduating seniors with this year’s recruits, the focus will return to the defensive end. This season, the Gauchos scored more points than any team during Mitchell’s reign, but also gave up the most points of any of her past teams.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to go back to being that really mean, tough, defensive team,” Mitchell said. “I think a combination of us trying to prove we could score 70 points a game this season … somehow we didn’t have the mindset or mentality to put away close games. So you know a lot of that will be put on my shoulders to make sure out team knows what our identity will look like, but I don’t think it will be hard to convince them after our record this year.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, in recruiting, Mitchell looked for versatile players while looking to add height to the roster.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for versatility and more of a physical presence body-wise. At the end of the day, most of the time it was on the defensive end we had a hard time matching up with people because of our lack of size,” Mitchell said. “At the championship level or when you get to March, it’s about grinding it out in the half court, both offensively and defensively. All play for great programs and they know what it takes to win. That’s, to me, the biggest thing.”</p>\n<p>This year’s recruiting class includes guard Dioseline Lopez, guard/forward Chaya Durr, guard Makala Roper, guard Taylor Farris and forward/center Sabrina Callahan.</p>\n<p><strong>Dioseline Lopez</strong></p>\n<p>Mitchell’s newest recruit, Lopez, is a 5’6” guard transferring from East Los Angeles College. Averaging 14.3 points per game and leading the South Coast Conference in assists, rebounds and steals with 7.4, 4.3 and 2.3 per game, respectively, Lopez was named SCC North Division Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Lopez was also named to the All-SCC North First Team for the second time and the California Community College Athletic Association All-State Third Team.</p>\n<p>“It only took me watching film on Dee to see that swag she has. She was able to play with our kids, and right away they were begging us to take her,” Mitchell said. “She’s a true point guard, but like Nic, has the ability to score a lot. I think [she] will relieve some of the pressure from Onome thinking that she has to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>Lopez brings more depth to the point guard position, but can also serve as a scoring threat for UCSB. Leading her team to the second round of the CCCAA Southern California playoffs, she scored 33 points and six assists in a tight 92-88 overtime loss.</p>\n<p>“She’ll run the show, she’ll facilitate, but if we need her to score, she has that ability,” Mitchell said. “She has toughness. She hasn’t had the easiest path to get here, and that’s okay with me because she has that fire to prove to everyone she can play at this level.”</p>\n<p><strong>Chaya Durr</strong></p>\n<p>Durr missed her senior season at Sacramento High School with an ACL tear, but should be 100 percent ready to go in August or September. She will join teammate Jasmine Ware as the second Sac High Lady Dragon on the Gaucho roster.</p>\n<p>“I have no problem saying it: We would’ve never signed her if she hadn’t have torn her ACL,” Mitchell said. “But I’m not worried about her missing her senior year of high school. We know what she’s capable of.”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard or forward position and listed at 5’11”, Durr averaged a double-double during her junior year with 18 points and 12 rebounds per contest. She also tallied 4.0 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. As a result, Durr was named all-city and an all-league first team member.</p>\n<p>“She’s a big-time athlete, very passionate and can make a huge difference on the [boards],” Mitchell said. “Defensively, she’s one of those that, if we want to press — and if you saw the team our last game of the year against Davis, that’s the style that will fit Chaya and help us have more of an up-tempo look.”</p>\n<p><strong>Makala Roper</strong></p>\n<p>A combination guard from Cleveland High School in Seattle, 5’8” Roper earned 3A Player of the Year honors this year after helping her team win the Class 3A State Girls Basketball title as both a junior and senior. Roper was honored with the MVP trophy of the Class 3A All-Tournament Team as well.</p>\n<p>“She’s a lefty and a deadly shooter,” Mitchell said. “She could play a little bit of point because she has great handles and even though she puts up big numbers and has the reputation of being a scorer, we know she’s a great passer and facilitator.”</p>\n<p>Leading her team to an undefeated 16-0 conference record, the player her teammates call “Sniper” averaged 16.3 points per game her senior year. In addition, according to MaxPreps, Roper is the top-ranked player in Washington.</p>\n<p>“She’ll be able to play the scoring position,” Mitchell said. “Losing Mel Zornig, she should give us that three-point shooter that we have graduating.”</p>\n<p><strong>Taylor Farris</strong></p>\n<p>Farris joins the Gauchos from Renton, Washington. Listed at 5’11”, Farris was named the League MVP as a junior. The same year, she led Renton High to third place, its best finish in the 2A State Tournament since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Taylor Farris is a long athlete,” Mitchell said. “She’s better around the basket and the rim. She works well in tight quarters and has great timing. ”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard position, Farris averaged 20.9 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 7.3 steals and 4.1 blocks her senior season.</p>\n<p>“She played at a smaller high school, but played for one of the top AAU programs, so we have no question she can come right in with her length — she gets tons of deflections,” Mitchell said. “Her comfort level may be the four right now because she’s great from the high post, but at some point, she shoots it well enough she’ll be able to move out to a perimeter position for us.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sabrina Callahan</strong></p>\n<p>Playing at forward or center at one of the women’s basketball powerhouses in Southern California, La Jolla Country Day School, Callahan averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.9 blocks per game. At 6’0”, she also shot 51 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“From day one, I told my staff I wanted a kid that played for Terri Bamford. She’s that good and that respected at La Jolla Country Day,” Mitchell said. “Her kids typically play with her all through their AAU program also, so they’re well-coached and understand the skills.”</p>\n<p>This season, Callahan earned All-San Diego Section second team honors.</p>\n<p>“Sabrina understands all the little things it takes to win, whether it’s screening, being a great passer, and a lot of times she’s the one out there directing traffic on the floor from the four position,” Mitchell said. “She gives us size, she gives us versatility and at some point she’ll move over to the wing position as well.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will begin its season in November. Included on the schedule will be LSU, which was a Sweet 16 team in the NCAA Tournament last season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of June 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/","id":509,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[508,507,506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fighting for Life in the Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.27.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.v.UCI-7_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.27.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.v.UCI-7_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on Hawaii on the road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team may be travelling to beautiful Hawaii, but there is no bigger business trip this year.

Hawaii currently holds the third seed in the Big West at 15-11 overall and 9-5 in conference. For UCSB, a win would go a long way in securing the eighth seed and ensuring it controls its own destiny.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying not to think about [the playoffs],” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We’re just trying to play one game at a time and focus on us. We’re focused on our next game: going to Hawaii and beating them at their place.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii holds the biggest home court advantage in the league with a five-and-a-half hour flight and a two-hour time zone difference separating it from every other Big West team. The Rainbow Wahine are 10-3 at home, including 6-1 during Big West play, with their only home loss coming to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB knows the feeling of victory in Hawaii, defeating the Rainbow Wahine last season on their home court.</p>\n<p>Earlier this season, Santa Barbara nearly came away with the victory in Thunderdome, falling 63-60. Hawaii shot 22-24 from the free throw line, including 19-20 in the second half, compared to 3-6 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Even then, UCSB held a lead in the final period until the Rainbow Wahine went to star senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who scored six straight points to give Hawaii a three-point lead with under a minute to go.</p>\n<p>“[From that game, we take] learning how to close games out,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’re pretty good for long stretches, but it came down to the last four minutes where a couple things fell apart. We have to learn how to win.”</p>\n<p>Jackson continues to lead Hawaii offensively, averaging 15.5 points and 9.7 rebounds while shooting 50.4 percent from the field. However, Jackson has not played in the last four games after suffering a foot injury against UC Riverside Feb. 13. It is unknown whether she will suit up tonight.</p>\n<p>In Jackson’s absence, the Rainbow Wahine have still been solid, going 3-1. Stepping up have been senior guard Shawna-Lei Keuhu, who leads the team in scoring during conference play with 12.2 points per game and scored a team-high 15 points in the Thunderdome, and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana, who averages 10.2 points per game. A big, physical team known for playing four power forwards and a point guard, Hawaii has plenty of options.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious they’ve found other players to step up and they’re winning without [Jackson],” Mitchell said. “She is a big-time player, but you can’t just focus on her. It won’t change our game plan at all [if she doesn’t play].”</p>\n<p>On the other end, the big emerging player for UCSB has been junior center Clair Watkins, who is a very different player than when Hawaii last saw her. In her last three games, Watkins has averaged a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Clair’s] major,” Mitchell said. “I know that. She knows that. We need her to get the paint and score.”</p>\n<p>Yet don’t expect an offensive battle tonight as both teams are very defensive minded. Under Mitchell, the Gauchos have been a team that prides itself on its defense and the Rainbow Wahine currently lead the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 60.7 points during conference play.</p>\n<p>“First of all, [the fact that they’re in first] frustrates me because that should be us and it was us in the past,” Mitchell said. “They’re big, they’re strong and they’re physical.

At the end of the day, it was the rebounding side of things.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine improve to 16-11 and 10-5 in the Big West, moving into a tie for second place with Cal Poly. UCSB on the other hand, falls to 8-20 overall and 3-12 in conference.</p>\n<p>With Riverside losing to UC Davis last night, the Gauchos continue to hold onto the eighth and final playoff spot by a one-game margin.</p>\n<p>Tied at 13 all with 11:43 to go in the first half, the Rainbow Wahine went on an 11-0 run sparked by offensive boards. With 11 offensive rebounds in the first half, four of those 11 points were scored on rebound putbacks. Control of the game remained in Hawaii’s hands the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a lot of miscommunications on defense, but the main reason (for their run) was the rebounding,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We played zone most of the game and I think we had problems finding people to box out.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii continued to stand up to its ranking as the top defensive team in the Big West, holding UCSB to just 21 points in the first half. The Rainbow Wahine also lead the league in rebounding margin, which they exemplified tonight, outrebounding UCSB 22-10 in the first half, creating the separation that would last the entirety of the contest.</p>\n<p>With leading scorer and rebounder Kamilah Martin on the bench due to injury, other players stepped up offensively for the Rainbow Wahine. Four players finished in double figures with senior forward Diane Moore and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana leading Hawaii with 17 points apiece, which is a career-high for Moore.</p>\n<p>“They’ve played four games without [Jackson], so it’s not like this was their first game,” Mitchell said. “Because of their style of play, they’re not making any major adjustments. They do such a great job of having a balanced attack, so they don’t just rely on one player.”</p>\n<p>The biggest bright spot to take away from last night’s game for UCSB was the play of Zornig, who tallied a game- and career-high 28 points and six rebounds on 11-20 shooting.</p>\n<p>“She was just aggressive and took good shots,” Mitchell said. “She was able to attack off of the dribble and has played that way the entire year. I’m extremely proud of her and her growth and maturity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fly home today and will need to prepare quickly for Cal Poly Saturday for senior day. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/","id":511,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[510,509,508],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
