Juan Camarena. <em>Courtesy of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div>\n<p>Lt. Juan Camarena will transfer from the Human Resources Bureau of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), where he has worked for 19 years, including service in the Major Crimes Division.</p>\n<p>Cintron was transferred to the Criminal Investigations Bureau, where he intends to ride out a nearly 28-year career into retirement. His transfer was part of a regular SBSO rotational schedule, under which officers serve for about two years in a division before rotating to another job.</p>\n<p>This won’t be the first time Camarena will serve in I.V., as he worked brief stints with the IVFP while he was a sheriff’s deputy in the late 2000s. He noted that I.V. today has a far less populous weekend party scene, crediting his predecessors for “making things safer” for the community.</p>\n<p>Born in Mexico to migrant field workers, Camarena is a first-language Spanish speaker, reader and writer. He joined the Marines out of high school before starting at the SBSO.</p>\n<p>Camarena said he will open his doors to both UC Santa Barbara students and I.V.’s robust Spanish-speaking population. While he’s getting settled into the job and familiarizing himself with the neighborhood, he said he will work to police by the “golden rule.”</p>\n<p>“Using just the simple values I learned from my parents will open the doors for me to address the community and build that trust,” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents in the past year have reacted strongly to reports of burglaries and sexual assaults.</p>\n<p>In May, Cintron attended an I.V. Community Services District Town Hall to address resident concerns directly. Camarena emphasized his own commitment to preventing assaults from occurring. While law enforcement won’t have all the answers, he said, a unified I.V. might be a step toward solution.</p>\n<p>“Little by little, I’m trying to introduce myself to the different communities so we can see what we in law enforcement and the community need to do to find that fair balance, so I.V. will be a safe place to live, to work in and visit,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron, by the numbers </strong></p>\n<p>Since Cintron came onto the IVFP in March 2016, crime rates have roughly improved in the neighborhood over a two-year period, according to statistics provided by SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>There were 190 burglaries in I.V in 2015, 196 in 2016 and 106 in 2017 through Nov. 29.</p>\n<p>When it comes to simple and aggravated assault, the numbers fluctuated.</p>\n<p>Between July 2015 and June 2016 there were 181 simple assaults, while between July 2016 and June 2017 there were 149.</p>\n<p>There were 35 aggravated assaults between July 2015 and June 2016 and 37 between July 2016 and June 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cintron reflects on achievements, challenges</strong></p>\n<p>Cintron, who took up the post of station lieutenant in March 2016, said he believes he helped I.V. continue a “trajectory toward the better” during his time.</p>\n<p>“I fully embraced and engaged with the community,” he said. His proudest efforts were put toward preserving community safety and reducing police presence during Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement presence decreased under Cintron’s watch, alongside a decline in crime. During the four-day period through Halloween 2016, the IVFP stationed nearly 300 officers. Less than 100 IVFP officers patrolled the streets during the same period in 2017.</p>\n<p>Cintron’s tenure didn’t go without controversy. A proposed noise ordinance in Oct. 2016 threatened to scale existing “no-loud-music” restrictions from midnight back to 10 p.m. on weekend nights. A sizable community response, comprised mostly of UCSB students, railed against the proposition. The IVFP promptly <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-17/foot-patrol-postpones-noise-ordinance-change-in-response-to-community-pushback/\">delayed</a> and later nixed the plan.<br>\nCintron maintains that the noise ordinance was never his idea; before he’d arrived, the IVFP was “constantly” receiving noise complaints and Cintron was told to finish the job, he said.</p>\n<p>For the most part, though, the community has made things easier for him, he said, which will, in turn, make things easier for Camarena, whom he called “very open-minded.”</p>\n<p>Nearing 30 years on the job at the SBSO, Cintron’s stint in I.V. will likely be the penultimate leg of his career.</p>\n<p>“It was a challenge, but I learned a lot,” he said. “A lot of different ideas from different people. It was a good time.

Hatton allowed all five runs during the first three innings, but in the final four he pitched, he allowed no runs and only three hits.</p>\n<p>Chandler pitched the eighth, allowing only one hit, while Davis pitched the ninth, allowing only two hits, picking up the win and making his record 5-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the final inning, the Gauchos batting finally came to life as they were able to score three runs on four hits to pick up a walk-off victory in its final nonconference game.</p>\n<p>The comeback began when redshirt junior infielder Ryan Cumberland hit a sac fly to right field to make the score 5-4. The redshirt sophomore JJ Muno hit an RBI single to tie the game up at five.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore Clay Fisher flied out, moving Mitchell to third to become the possible go-ahead run. Then sophomore Austin Bush was up to the plate. The Gonzaga pitcher walked him while also throwing a wild pitch on the fourth ball, which scored Mitchell and sealed the Gauchos 6-5 victory.</p>\n<p>It was another solid win for a team striving to rack up the victories as postseason play approaches. The 64-team NCAA tournament will be announced next Monday.</p>\n<p>With its final series coming up and 36 solid wins on the season, clinching a series win over UC Riverside and maintaining a third place standing in the conference should be enough to get the team into the postseason. However, there is still work to be done, and it will be interesting to see how this young team closes the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is against UCR at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium beginning Thursday, May 26 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

With a 24-5 overall mark to this point and the No. 6 highest rating percentage index (RPI, a quantity used to rank sports teams based upon a team’s wins and losses and its strength of schedule) in the country, Santa Barbara has set itself up for its best season since its College World Series run in 2016.</p>\n<p>It also helps that UCSB proved itself a little bit in its opening Big West series, taking two of three at Fullerton to be second in the conference standings with a 2-1 mark.</p>\n<p>However, there are still people that doubt the Gauchos and roll with the team that is cruising into town this weekend, UC Irvine. And it makes sense because if UCSB is the most dominant team to this point, UCI is not far behind.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_82972\" style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82972\" data-attachment-id=\"82972\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/ucsb-in-must-win-situation-heads-to-long-beach/armani-smith-is-ready-for-the-ball-to-be-pitched-angie-banks-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Baseball_vs_USC-040317-AngieBanks-02.5-web.jpg?fit=942%2C1413&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"942,1413\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Armani Smith is ready for the ball to be pitched.

In fact, after starting the year 8-4, Irvine has won 13 of its last 15 ball games with its last loss coming to No. 1 UCLA, 9-3.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine also has one of the most impressive players in the conference, junior third baseman Brandon Lewis. Lewis is leading the Anteaters and Big West in many major offensive categories with his 11 home runs, 37 RBIs, 13 doubles and a slugging percentage of .773. That slugging percentage is also 11th in the entire NCAA.</p>\n<p>Just recently, the Porter Ranch, Calif. native was named to the USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award Midseason Watch List, a prestigious award given to the top amateur baseball player in the country. Lewis is the lone Big West member on the 40-player list.</p>\n<p>One of his teammates that was considered, however, was junior right-handed pitcher Andre Pallante. The San Clemente, Calif. native is having an outstanding year currently sporting a 2.83 ERA with 44 punchouts.</p>\n<p>Pallante is slated as the starter for Friday’s game as he has been all year, but it would be fair to say he has not faced a lineup quite like UCSB’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have some of the top hitters in the league with junior catcher Eric Yang being only one of two players to have above a .400 batting average and players like Armani Smith and Tommy Jew, each having eight home runs apiece, tied for second most in the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also ranks first in the following categories of the conference: slugging percentage (.492), on-base percentage (.385), home runs (34) and RBI’s (197).</p>\n<p>UCSB is also fast on the base paths as Tevin Mitchell and Jew are first and second in the Big West with 15 and 14 stolen bases this season, respectively.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also has some tough cats on the mound. Friday starter Ben Brecht has been great this season with a 3.00 ERA and 61 strikeouts, the second most in the conference.</p>\n<p>Even better, Brecht has accumulated a 6-0 record in his eight starts, proving he has done a good job of giving his relievers some room to breathe. Brecht averages about six innings per start, but in his last start, the southpaw tossed 7.1 innings.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Jack Dashwood has also been a good weekend start for the Gauchos as he sports a 2.27 ERA in 39.2 innings of work. That ERA ranks in the top five of the conference.</p>\n<p>Junior righty Chris Lincoln is the first man out of the pen for the Gauchos in usual tough spots and he has been good this season. Despite his 4.29 ERA not being the most impressive, Lincoln has usually delivered for UCSB as proven by his seven saves this season.</p>\n<p>Overall, this series will be a great one. By no means does it determine a conference winner, but conference victories are always a hot commodity. And with the race for the Big West just starting out, no team can afford to lose ground.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host UC Irvine for game one of the three-game series at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 12 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Game two will commence at 2 p.m. on Saturday while game three will start at 1 p.m. on Sunday at the same location.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the April 11, 2019 print edition of</em> <em>the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
