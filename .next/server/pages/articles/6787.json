Bassy utilizes this hurt to fuel his art. Several of us will be experiencing a different kind of pain as we endure finals week, which is why seeing Marc E. Bassy when he hits Velvet Jones next Wednesday will be the perfect remedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born in the Bay Area yet residing in Los Angeles, Marc E. Bassy is no stranger to the artistic scene that defines the West Coast. After working with artists like G-Eazy, Chris Brown, Wiz Khalifa and Kehlani, one might think that he would already be a household name. Instead, his inimitable talent is masked by our perception of what genre(s) music should be categorized into. However, it has yet to alter the outcome of the electric melodies he continues to make.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc E.

Vulnerability is what keeps one human, and it is embodied in the sound that Marc E. Bassy has crafted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has performed on larger stages across the world, so it is fair to say that as he takes the stage of Velvet Jones, it will be an impressive experience for everyone in the room.

And, as with any particularly tumultuous time, it left us with some amazing music. In this special end-of-year list, the Artsweek staff reflects on some of our favorites. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Emotion: Side B</i></b><b> by Carly Rae Jepsen</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “Call Me Maybe” singer shifted from guilty pleasure pop anthems to complex stories disguised in ’80s pop arrangements. Jepsen channels the complexities of a love-struck mind into song, creating a colorful haven that is welcoming to all. Although these are unused songs from Jepsen’s 2015 project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, these B-sides highlight a sincerity in modern pop music that is often diluted, or even completely lost. With the guidance of indie-heavy hitters Dev Hynes and Greg Kurstin, Jepsen made a project full of melancholic songs that could instantly become the soundtrack to the next independent coming-of-age film. The track “Cry” accentuates the downfalls of unrequited love with inviting synths, no doubt an influence from Hynes. The disco pulse radiating from the ’80s in “Body Language” had people singing the chorus in the shower in a matter of time. There is no need to put your Spotify on a private session when listening to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion: Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; this is an album that no one should feel guilty about listening to. Jepsen deserves more recognition for her ability to transform from one-hit wonder status to the same realm as imaginative indie-pop artists like Sky Ferreira. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Rodriguez</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service </i></b><b>by A Tribe Called Quest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legendary jazz-rap maestros A Tribe Called Quest reunite for their swan song with their first album in 18 years, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The group’s sound has aged like a fine wine, and their influence is all over the modern rap game, which is full of jazzy beats and lyrics that celebrate blackness. The group even acknowledges this on the song “Dis Generation” which passes the torch from the old guard to the new vanguard of hip-hop music shouting out “Joey, Earl, Kendrick and Cole.” Another example of the group’s sound being perfect for 2016 is the politically charged lead single, “We The People….” With divisions between people being a huge part of the rhetoric of the last election season, this track fights back emphatically. The chorus, for example, rails against the rhetoric of people like Donald Trump who believe that black, Mexican, Muslim and gay people are “bad folks” who “must go.” A Tribe Called Quest instead sells a message of unity with the track from the opening lyric, “We don’t believe you ’cause we the people,” by drawing on the language of our constitution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the standout tracks, it’s impossible to talk about the album without mentioning the recent passing of founding member Phife Dawg in March. The group does an amazing job celebrating the life of The Five-Footer throughout the album by incorporating Phife’s raps recorded before his death and the emotionally charged tribute, “Lost Somebody.” As Tribe calls it quits with their final album, don’t feel that you’ve lost a great rap group; instead, celebrate that they went out with a banger. As for Phife Dawg, “he’s in sunshine.”</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Splendor &amp; Misery </i></b><b>by clipping</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The experimental, noise-rap trio led by 2016 Tony Award winner and frontman Daveed Diggs is back with one of the strangest releases of the year. According to their label, Sub Pop, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Splendor &amp; Misery</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an Afrofuturist, dystopian concept album that follows the sole survivor of a slave uprising on an interstellar cargo ship and the onboard computer that falls in love with him. If that doesn’t sound like a unique album, then I don’t know what does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thematically, clipping analyzes blackness in the modern age by catapulting it into the future and the past at the same time. The protagonist, the slave from the future Cargo 2311, comforts himself by rapping over the clangs and buzzes of the spaceship itself, and this is reflected beautifully by William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes’s instrumentation that transport the listener to the noisy ship perfectly. The album makes many allusions to the past through choral renditions of African-American slave spirituals and tackles universal themes of loneliness and existentialism as the main character suffers anxiety and depression as a result of constantly feeling on-the-run. These futuristic ideas have a basis in our modern age, but the Cargo 2331 passenger comforts himself by reasserting his roots through rap music and slave spirituals. This is reflected in today’s America, where black artists are reasserting their identity through their music in an environment that can feel hopeless with systemic injustices. </span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Blackstar</i></b><b> by David Bowie</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Bowie did something amazing with his final album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Of course, it is his last album because he sadly passed away in January. However, what is truly remarkable about Bowie as an artist is that he used the pain of the cancer he eventually succumbed to and awareness of his own mortality to make his art. With </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he solidifies his nearly 50-year legacy as one of the most unique artists of the last century. Not only is the subject matter innovative and unique as Bowie explores his own death, but it’s a testament to Bowie’s constant evolution as an artist that this album sounds very distinct from his previous work. He fully embraces jazz experimentalism with this album, despite being a rock legend. Additionally, with Bowie being older, he has adapted his music to highlight his weathered voice by focusing on the timbre of his vocals and the haunting mood that they create throughout the album. Overall, this album was a legendary send-off for a legendary man and artist. As Bowie tells his fans and loved ones on the song, “Dollar Days,” “Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you.” And we won’t forget you either. Rest in peace, Starman.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Blonde </i></b><b>by Frank Ocean</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most anticipated album of the year, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the follow-up to Ocean’s acclaimed 2012 debut into alternative R&amp;B stardom, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">channel ORANGE</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On this album, Ocean continues doing what we love him for: being himself. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">features Ocean bearing his heart and soul on his sleeve as he sings about unrequited love, depression and other events from his life. The project features some of the most emotionally charged vocals and lyrics of the year as Ocean’s raw humanity shines through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the intensity of emotion and imagery throughout the album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is rather minimal. So minimal, you might not notice that Beyoncé, perhaps the most well-known modern pop artist, sings background vocals on “Pink + White” or any of the other understated features including sad Swedish rapper Yung Lean on “Self Control.” And that’s without mentioning the myriad of other artists on the album including James Blake and Pharrell Williams. This style allows Ocean’s voice to take center stage without wasting any energy on superfluous instrumentation. However, there is one feature that stands out above the rest: André 3000 on “Solo (Reprise).” André 3000 brought so much energy in his one-minute-long feature that people are begging him for a new album. This is for good reason, as “Solo (Reprise)” was, in this writer’s opinion, the best guest feature of 2016. This moment of intensity does well to inject energy into the album while keeping the focus on Ocean’s minimal style that pervades the other tracks. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have taken a while to finally come out, but any Frank Ocean fan will tell you that the wait was worth it, as he released one of the best records of the year.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>ROCKISDEAD</i></b><b> by Dorothy</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They may have named their album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but in 35 minutes the members of Dorothy prove that rock remains alive and thriving. Old school without feeling overdone, the quartet’s debut record comes packed with infectious clapping beats, blues-inspired guitar riffs and even hints of country all centered around lead singer Dorothy Martin’s powerhouse vocals. Even if you can’t quite belt with the same ferocity as Martin, it’s hard to resist singing along with her hooks. So go ahead and put on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> next time you’re on a drive; wail your heart out about what a wild and reckless rock star you are. </span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Teens Of Denial</i></b><b> by Car Seat Headrest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirteen albums in, Will Toledo and the rest of Car Seat Headrest show no signs of winding down. In fact, with their latest release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they’ve only picked up speed, so buckle up and take a listen. Appearing on multiple music publications’ best-of-2016 lists, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeds in its ability to make you feel okay with not being okay. The record offers an honest take on often-heavy topics including clinical depression, but the music never strays into cynicism, maintaining positive and hopeful sounds throughout. If you’re looking for a feel-good take on the low points in life or even just some catchy lo-fi rock tunes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is waiting for you.</span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>City Club </i></b><b>by The Growlers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of the twisted beach carnival vibe created in The Growlers’ </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot Tropics, City Club</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels more like watching a five-piece downtown Vegas casino house band while peaking on acid, Raoul Duke style. In lieu of Sinatra covers, they’re playing “I’ll Be Around,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and it’s a little confusing, but there’s nothing wrong with being disoriented sometimes. That is what is so special about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to me. While 2016 has been a time of questionable changes and uncertainty, The Growlers keep it fresh while staying true to their roots. It’s fun, romantic, weird and different from anything else out there. The Growlers are a comforting reminder that all hope isn’t lost. In a genre that has become increasingly derivative, no one else can even do a quality job at ripping them off. With the aptly titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Growlers move away from the surf rock stylings that made up the bulk of their work. Tunes like “Beach Rats” and “Burden of the Captain,” which previously defined their style now morph into “Night Ride” and “Rubber and Bone.” This transition hasn’t happened all at once and doesn’t isolate die-hard Beach Goth festival fans. It’s a diversification of The Growlers, and it’s rad.</span></p>\n<p>— Sean Edwards</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>A Moon Shaped Pool </i></b><b>by Radiohead</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English alternative lords Radiohead released their ninth studio album in 2016, and it was a gentle reminder that they are still relevant and ever-powerful influencers of music culture. Entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the album is an ethereal blend of soft droning melodies and piercing lyrics that evoke such profound emotion from mundane words. Thom Yorke has always had a unique ability to speak simply but wholly capture exactly what you’re feeling. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does this just as well as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK Computer </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bends, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and worms its way into your mind. It relates itself to everything that’s been swirling around your brain, getting deeper with every play. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels like classic Radiohead: a little inaccessible, but that’s the point. There isn’t a Radiohead album that is immediately easily digestible; they all require active thought to really enjoy. Just like jogging through a museum, a half-assed listen may leave you confused and a little sweaty. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reveals something new or makes you feel something different with every listen. It becomes a distorted reflection of internal processes, and Yorke’s blunt lyrics still leave room for creation of your own context. Radiohead once again slipped under our skin and delivered 11 tracks to make us think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Sean Edwards</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Malibu</i></b><b> by Anderson .Paak</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hip hop fans have been waiting for Anderson .Paak for a long time. For years, we have been left struggling to prove the true musicality and talent required to excel in our beloved art form. We could point to Kendrick Lamar for his lyrical wizardry, or Dr. Dre and his command of modern technology in production, but there was no one with undeniable musical greatness. With the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the live shows that followed, Anderson .Paak has changed all of that. A Grammy nominated album recorded on an old laptop and dented microphone, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> features a mix of soulful singing and rapping over instrument-based beats with samples from the likes Hiatus Kaiyote or fully original tunes curated by .Paak and his longtime band, The Free Nationals. Additionally, .Paak is completely redefining the standard of hip-hop live shows. While many rappers only feature a hypeman and a DJ, .Paak’s live show is music being played almost entirely live. Paak himself brings an unmatched energy with his bold personality, quirky outfits and astounding drumming capabilities (these aren’t Bieber drum fills, they’re jazz fills!). At the end of 2016, .Paak, The Free Nationals and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have brought some much-needed funk and soul pizazz to hip hop all the while raising the bar for what it means to be a performer.</span></p>\n<p>— Daniel Carroll</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Cardinal</i></b><b> by Pinegrove</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The natural inclination of people in their late teens and early twenties is to be apathetic. Whether it’s a dead-end job, rough times in school or even a hangover, there will always be a mild feeling of dislike within close reach. Pinegrove, folk-punk’s latest prodigy, captures this feeling with both wit and self-awareness on their debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardinal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “How come every outcome is such a comedown?” lead singer Evan Stephens Hall sings in a tone both sardonic and earnest on the lead track “New Friends.” The exact genre of Pinegrove’s music is hard to pinpoint, dipping into the sensibilities of modern pop-punk, toying with elements of folk and even hinting at a country twang. Music’s current state is one that has no boundaries, and this is a band that is aware of the greatness this can bring. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p>\n<p><b><i>Holy Ghost</i></b><b> by Modern Baseball</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Split between lead singers Brendan Lukens and Jake Ewald, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an 11-track confrontation of depression, loss and past loves. If you listen to the album on shuffle, the two frontmen act as a foil to one another. Ewald’s side is bold, while Lukens’ side is dark. Ewald grew up in a religious household, so tinges of those memories appear in his lyrics at times, most apparent in his wry mention of a girl who is “sipping from that holy cup.” Lukens’ mental health battles are approached directly, “always looking back on my mistakes and others’,” he sings at one point. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the band’s third album, and their growth is clear in the way they continuously dig deeper into themselves without over-exploiting their own struggles. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p><div

artists that typically would not think to stop in the city. Thanks to the large capacity of the venue, SB is advancing on the charts as a concert city next to places like Los Angeles and San Diego and has even sparked the interest of arising hip hop legend G-Eazy. G-Eazy will be making a stop in Santa Barbara on the second leg of his “When It’s Dark Out” tour Tuesday, April 19 and, as per usual, will not make his exit without leaving his mark on the beautiful city.</p>\n<p>Young Gerald, aka G-Eazy, knew from the beginning that he was going to make it big, yet he remained humble and let other people find out for themselves just how good he is. His lyrics are often misinterpreted as being filled with the typical tangents of cockiness that rappers rant about in the midst of their fame; however, G-Eazy’s perception of himself and what he is capable of has remained constant throughout his music even as he evolves as an artist. When this is attributed to his character, it is easy to decode the messages in his music in a negative light and dislike him as a person. On the contrary, his love for his fans is monumental, and it is evident that he will not rest until he puts the Bay Area on the map. As well as repping the Bay, he is known for collaborating with a number of well-known artists like Mod Sun, Blackbear, Kehlani and Marc E. Bassy.</p>\n<p>Even with the restless back-to-back shows on his lengthy tours, G-Eazy found the time to open another leg of “When It’s Dark Out” shows after the release of the album. The album itself received an overwhelming amount of reviews from astounded critics on various social media outlets and music blogs. The first leg of the tour featured surprise guest appearances from artists like Chris Brown, YG, ASAP Ferg and Diddy, leading fans to describe his shows as something directly out of a movie. That being said, when G-Eazy books a show, he brings a show. Fans at the Santa Barbara Bowl will be in for a treat and will get to discover exactly what things happen when it’s dark out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/","id":6785,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6784,6783,6782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Maceo Parker Brings Legendary Funk to Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Maceo-Parker-1-by-Ines-Kaiser.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Maceo-Parker-1-by-Ines-Kaiser.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s own Campbell Hall hosted a performance by the legendary funk and soul jazz saxophonist Maceo Parker as a part of Arts & Lectures’ Roots Series","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p class=\"Normal1\">The dim room stirred in anticipation as nearly every seat was filled with eager bodies. The stage was brightly lit in hues of blues, red and violet. On Thursday night, UCSB’s own Campbell Hall hosted a performance by the legendary funk and soul jazz saxophonist Maceo Parker as a part of Arts &amp; Lectures’ Roots series. Parker is most known for his work alongside James Brown in the 1960s and with Parliament-Funkadelic in the ’70s. After going solo in the ’90s, he began playing alongside legends like Prince and De La Soul.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The crowd, composed of mainly older adults and a few college students, sat in the massive auditorium waiting for the first act to go on. The room was almost completely full and many were buzzing with excitement, creating a very high energy in the room.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Opening for Parker was The Jones Family Singers, a band made up of family members from Houston, Tex. Performing in the style of gospel blues and jazz, this was their Santa Barbara debut. They had amazing stage presence, directing the audience to stand up and dance along with them. Their large vocal range rang through the hall as their five vocalists filled the room with bluesy lyrics. The energy they brought to the stage was so powerful that many people stood up and jived along while clapping to the beat. One of the main vocalists then employed a call-response method, successfully engaging with the audience by transporting them back to the roots of gospel. The crowd was so high-energy and so responsive, one could feel more than just the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The screams of the crowd were almost deafening, drowning out the sounds of the announcer. The music started and the crowd went almost silent. The heavy bass and strong funky drum pattern complemented the smooth sounds of Parker’s saxophone. Add in the brass trombone, a guitar and a piano, and the blending of sounds brought you back to the funkadelic grooves of the 1970s. Parker’s music epitomizes what funk is; the rhythmic tune of the bass emphasized the down beat alongside the jazzy and soulful blues. The compilation of intricate sounds blended together so effortlessly, varying between slow jazz and a faster upbeat, funky tempo. One could hardly sit still. Many were shaking their heads, tapping their feet and swaying to the intense rhythm. At one point, many had gotten up out of their chairs to dance to the music. The entire set was accompanied by shouts of love and encouragement as well as constant clapping and whistles. The legend played well-known songs by other famous artists like Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx, Marvin Gaye and Ben E. King. Parker continually sang in his deep, throaty voice “We love you,” engaging with the audience while also showing his appreciation. He made small jokes here and there, really talking to his audience, confirming his ability to connect with the crowd. The response back to Parker was electric and almost tangible. The audience grooved to the tunes as the sharp guitar riffs and the blunt plucking sound of the bass echoed through the hall. The energy, almost as palpable as the music itself, rang through the ears of every person experiencing Parker’s talent. The show ended with a very long, rad drum solo, and Parker played the crowd out. Screams and claps reverberated through the large hall.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">UCSB alumnus Patricia Oreño said that this was a wonderful time. “As a child of the ’70s, I grew up with funk, and I’ve always been a fan. I had so much fun. I don’t come to these events as often as I should, but I’m glad I came to this one. I hope they have him back because I will be back for him.”</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/","id":6786,"author":{"id":737,"name":"Savanah Marshall"},"related":[6785,6784,6783],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
