The campaign calls for the Abrego Villas property manager Majestic Asset Management, LLC to abide by Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, stating landlords must provide relocation funds to tenants if five or more are evicted within 90 days of each other. The evicted tenants, most of who are low income Latino families, have filed a small claims lawsuit with a hearing scheduled for early March, and officials with IVTU and the Associated Students Legal Resource Center estimate the tenants are entitled to up to $10,500 each in county benefits.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60969\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60969\" data-attachment-id=\"60969\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/isla-vista-continues-tenants-rights-campaign/ivtu-march-2-13_christine-skari-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=1069%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1069,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March 2-13_Christine Skari-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60969\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8-684x1024.jpg?resize=268%2C401\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"268\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?w=1069&amp;ssl=1 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60969\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>During the event, protesters made beaded bracelets with words like “justice” and “tenants” on them and the IVTU distributed free IVTU shirts and sandwiches. Protesters then marched the streets and chanted slogans including “Tenants United, Will Never Be Divided!” and “Fight! Fight! Fight! Housing Is A Right.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major and IVTU Development Director Alejandro Sanchez said the tenants union organized the demonstration in order to bring attention to an issue that he said effects all residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“Some people might think that we’re just here for the six families, but that’s not necessarily true,” Sanchez said. “The six families are part of the community and as a whole were just trying to help them out. At the end of the day, it’s not just for them. It’s for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, who attended the march, said the evictions at Abrego Villas are the latest in a history of similar housing issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“They’ve been doing it for years now and it’s not a new thing, evicting people,” Minoiefar said. “It reflects how the landlords here feel that they can do whatever they want — in terms of rent, in terms of upkeep, everything. Housing issues here are ridiculous. And this is just one of the worst ways in which they abuse their power.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology and political science double major Cameron Schunk said outside management companies need to recognize I.V. is not a “lawless” area where tenants’ rights violations can go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>“Where I come from, if people next door were evicted en mass, there would be uproar and there would be protest,” Schunk said. “We’re coming together and saying, ‘Not in our community … You cannot just come here and take advantage of renters. That’s not how it works.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60966\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60966\" data-attachment-id=\"60966\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/isla-vista-continues-tenants-rights-campaign/ivtu-march-2-13_christine-skari-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=1069%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1069,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March 2-13_Christine Skari-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60966\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5-684x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C599\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?w=1069&amp;ssl=1 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60966\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Schunk, student and I.V. resident participation in demonstrations is vital to bringing the evicted tenant situation to justice.</p>\n<p>“Exposing the fact that these things are happening is paramount,” Schunk said. “As well as gathering community interest to fight these occurrences in the future.

Tenants Union organized a community march to Abrego Villas. They plan to do the same thing this Friday. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenant Union (IVTU) plans to lead a picket on Friday at 12 p.m. beginning at the Pardall Center as part of their “Tenants Reclaiming Isla Vista” campaign protesting the eviction of six Latino families from their homes at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road in October.</p>\n<p>IVTU’s campaign calls for Majestic Asset Management, Inc., the property management company of the Abrego Villa apartments, to abide by Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444 which states that landlords must provide relocation funds to families evicted from rental units that are deemed unsafe to occupy. The evicted tenants have filed small claims lawsuits.</p>\n<p>IVTU President Andrey Bogdanov said the aim of the march is to educate the community on the ongoing issue of mass evictions in I.V. and call on Majestic Asset Management, Inc. to grant the evicted tenants relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>“We would like to see the tenants as a united force, fighting for better housing in Isla Vista,” Bogdanov said. “These tenants were unable to defend themselves on their own because greedy out-of-town investors and the community should stand up for them because it can happen to any one of us. That is the reality.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about solidarity in Isla Vista, well this is the time to really see what that is. – Brandon Baker, I.V. resident and recent UCSB graduate</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a previous interview, President of Majestic Asset Management, Inc. Brian Lezak said Majestic complied with all the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and did not violate any laws.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak in an email. “We will defend their position in court which is the proper place.”</p>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic wants to give back to the I.V. residents by providing apartment housing that is clean and affordable, and the Abrego Villas renovations were in part made to reduce water consumption.</p>\n<p>“The management willingly made additional changes which will also allow the property to use other utilities more efficiently, which again is in support of the conservation goals of Isla Vista and Santa Barbara,” Lezak said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Andrew Prieto said he plans to participate in the picket to support the local community and “make a statement” about what kind of treatment residents are willing to accept from landlords.</p>\n<p>“Those removed from their homes will get the justice and equal treatment they deserve,” Prieto said. “The point of the rally isn’t to attack people or attack the property companies but bring attention to the injustices and hope that attention will foster a change.</p>\n<p>Brandon Baker, an I.V. resident and recent UCSB graduate, said he plans to attend the march to fulfill a desire to create positive change.</p>\n<p>“I just didn’t think it was enough to read about the eviction and sit at home,” Baker said. “I wanted to actually be a part of the movement or process to bring change. We talk about solidarity in Isla Vista, well this is the time to really see what that is.”</p>\n<p>Baker said the Abrego evictions present another example of poor treatment of resident in an environment in which students are already abused by landlords who charge too much for rent in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Rent’s already high enough and I have to buy food and gas and stuff too,” Baker said. “If we let them do this, it sets a precedent for other realtors to do the same thing. I’m already paying a lot of money to live in a shithole.

Self-Governance Bill AB 3 was written by Assemblyman Das Williams and proposes to make I.V. a community services district (CSD), which would allow I.V. to levy taxes in order to provide services such as additional lighting, parking, community maintenance and advocacy through elected board members. LAFCO has drafted a letter of concern over the bill, requiring it to pass through their jurisdiction before progressing into the state legislature.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the initial opposition to the bill stemmed from LAFCO members’ concern over not being involved and informed about the process.</p>\n<p>“I think that LAFCO members are concerned because normally when we talk about making a community services district, it would go through LAFCO, not the state legislature,” Farr said. “That’s why a special meeting has been called to decide whether to send a letter or not.”</p>\n<p>Farr said sending the bill to state legislature does not necessarily exclude LAFCO from being involved with the creation of a CSD and that after the bill is drafted in its entirety there will be a chance to determine whether LAFCO will approve it or not.</p>\n<p>“Because we don’t know what the final bill language is, it’s entirely possible LAFCO will be involved,” Farr said. “Actually when the legislature passed a similar bill to create a college district for Isla Vista 30–40 years ago, they did part of and it gave it to LAFCO to draft another part.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO’s involvement is vital in order to ensure the bill can last in the state legislature.</p>\n<p>“They have hearings here in the community: it’s easier to go than to go up to Sacramento to testify for something,” said Farr.</p>\n<p>Farr said if the city wants to change the boundaries of a district, they have to go through LAFCO, and defining a specific district for the CSD requires LAFCO’s jurisdiction. Applying for a change in boundaries or districts involves a process during which proponents must obtain a certain amount of community support via petition form, pay an application fee and submit payment for fiscal analysis. According to Farr, this process is difficult to carry out in I.V. because of the temporary nature of the residents.</p>\n<p>“In a community like IV it’s very challenging to go through this process because [the process] is designed for permanent long term residents,” Farr said. “That’s part of why something like this hasn’t happened before by being generated from within the community.”</p>\n<p>In regard to finding a solution to what Farr described as a lack of permanent resident responsibility in I.V., Farr said there has been some discussion regarding changing boundaries to include university-owned housing and involve more students and staff in the self-governance discussion.</p>\n<p>“Who would decide that is the question right now, would it be the chancellor or the county, it would work to bring the community more longevity and stability,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, LAFCO will be able to take a position on the matter when the language of the AB 3 is finalized. Farr also said it is difficult to detail specific aspects of the CSD, such as policing powers.</p>\n<p>“The CSD could have policing powers but law enforcement services are extremely expensive,” Farr said, “We would have to find more money as opposed to letting the county continue to foot that bill.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a facet of the community the CSD might be able to address is referred to as the “broken window effect,” which is when a community starts to look bad or degrade and then becomes more attractive for individuals to continue to destroy as opposed to maintain.</p>\n<p>“It kind of comes back to the built environment and having housing that’s attractive that makes students want to stay in the community after they graduate, creating a group of less temporary residents in Isla Vista,” Farr said.<br>\nAccording to Farr, I.V. requires a newly modeled CSD to address issues of public safety in the neighborhood due to its uniqueness, and there has always been student interest in the matter.</p>\n<p>“We need to address a model that is different than what we’ve done before. That’s what the committee member is working on right now,” Farr said. “There’s always been a lot of student interest from the very beginning, and ever since I’ve been in office there hasn’t been a six month period gone by when a student hasn’t brought up CSD and LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>Farr said a special meeting will be held one week from today to discuss a new draft for AB 3, and despite the fate of the letter, LAFCO and the State legislature will continue tracking the bill and making suggestions.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a new issue though. What’s happened is that incidents that occurred last spring really galvanized the community, university and trustees,” Farr said. “AB 3 came out of the trustees’ report and this was their ultimate recommendation. It is definitely time once again to explore what options are out there and make some changes,” Farr said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60868\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60868\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/farr-talks-about-lafco-i-v-self-governance/","id":4768,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4767,4766,4765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County Board of Supervisors, Sheriff’s Dept.

According to the current Facebook event, Deltopia 2015 is scheduled for Saturday April 4.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said supervisors at Tuesday’s meeting in Santa Maria granted the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department’s request to help keep everyone safe during the unsponsored event.</p>\n<p>“The changes were made at the request of the Sheriff’s department in order to assist them in managing the crowds at a Deltopia event, similar to what is already in place for the Halloween event,” Farr said. “Both Halloween and Deltopia are unsponsored events. This means no one wants to take responsibility or be liable for what happens at these events.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, supervisors felt the need to create the noise ordinances so that law enforcement could better prevent Deltopia from erupting in disorder again.</p>\n<p>“The County’s main job is to protect the public’s health and safety and the Sheriff’s department felt that this would be an important tool to assist them in doing that during Deltopia,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr and other members on the Board of Supervisors created the noise ordinances by amending Chapter 6 Article VI of Santa Barbara County Code, which governs “outdoor festivals.” According to the code, an outdoor festival is defined as “any musical festival, dance festival, ‘rock’ festival or similar music activity”. Any person violating this code by staging an “outdoor festival” between 6 p.m. of such date and 7 a.m. of the following date will be subject to a citation. Farr said the noise ordinances will be in effect April 3–5 and 10–12.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 6,036 individuals on Facebook had identified themselves as “going” to the Deltopia 2015 event. Deltopia 2014 attracted an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 partygoers.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemical engineering major Erich Brodbeck, who has lived on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive for two years, proposed a checkpoint system to curb out-of-towners from entering I.V. Brodbeck pointed out that a majority of those arrested last year were out-of-towners and insisted that they are not invited this year.</p>\n<p>“Ideally the police department should set up checkpoints around Isla Vista on the week leading up to Deltopia and on Deltopia weekend requiring people show proof of residence or some other form of identification,” Brodbeck said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department Sergeant Rob Romero said law enforcement is determined to maintain a safe environment should Deltopia take place.</p>\n<p>“We will be bringing in additional UCPD support and will be implementing safety procedures similar to what students experienced during Halloween,” Romero said in an email. “Our role is to address issues of student and community safety and help create a safe environment. We will be working closely with the Sheriff’s Department towards this goal.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">According to Brodbeck, because Deltopia is scheduled online without restrictions, stronger steps should be taken to keep too many people from attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“Since the event is openly shared on Facebook and can reach many individuals, more drastic measures need to be taken in case these out-of-towners do show up expecting to party in our community,” said </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Brodbeck</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">. “How our community handles Deltopia this year will speak volumes to all the eyes that are on us.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Yang stating: “Since the event is openly shared on Facebook and can reach many individuals, more drastic measures need to be taken in case these out-of-towners do show up expecting to party in our community…How our community handles Deltopia this year will speak volumes to all the eyes that are on us.” This statement was actually provided by Erich Brodbeck.
