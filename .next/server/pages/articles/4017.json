Within Isla Vista, restaurants like Woodstock’s and Rockfire Grill have partially reopened for dine-in meals, although public spaces within restaurants, like bars and gaming areas, must remain closed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses that are allowed to reopen in this phase will be required to make modifications to decrease the risk of coronavirus spread, including new safety training for staff and enforcement of social distancing for patrons, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses must also “review state and local guidance, complete a COVID-19 Prevention Plan, and self-certify that they can open safely,” to receive a certificate from the county and reopen legally, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This next phase of our reopening process will help get more Santa Barbara County residents back to work, while ensuring that local businesses modify operations to keep their customers and workers safe,” according to a </span><a href=\"http://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/phd/PROGRAMS/Disease_Control/Corona/HOO2020-8-2Stage2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new health order</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> issued by the County’s Public Health Department in response to the phase two approval.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The phase two reopening is part of a four-stage </span><a href=\"http://readysbc.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reopening In Safe Environment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (RISE) plan from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to safely reopen the state amidst the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 19, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors approved draft attestation to confirm that the county is meeting reopening standards. The state approved the attestation on May 20, allowing an “exciting next step for our entire community,” Van Do-Reynoso, director of the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Santa Barbara County is implementing a program to help businesses expand into “public right-of-way outdoor areas” in the county’s unincorporated regions to help advance social distancing protocols, the press release read. A second phase of the project is in development to help businesses expand onto private property, like parking lots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the evening of May 21 in Isla Vista, the Study Hall Bar and Grill was open for business in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-22/study-hall-bar-open-thursday-night-in-violation-of-county-and-state-health-order/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">direct violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the state and county stay-at-home orders — and the phase two guidelines — after it was seen serving at least 10 people without masks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Gov.

over the next days and weeks, Ansorg said.</span> <em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newest confirmed coronavirus cases are residents between 22 to 59 years of age, with four cases in South County and two cases in North County, according to Batson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the total confirmed cases, 19 are recovering from home, four have fully recovered –– and have completed 14 days of monitoring by the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department –– and only one person has been hospitalized due to the virus, Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batson said she and her team are preparing to present specific information about the locations and regions where cases have been identified in coming days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county plans to hold press conferences every day this week to update the public on the coronavirus spread and efforts to contain it, Gina DePinto, communications manager for Santa Barbara County, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the number of cases grows in the county, the department’s efforts will focus on mitigation, Batson said, adding that the department will “focus [its] investigation efforts on confirmed individuals who have had exposures in congregate settings such as health care facilities, correctional facilities, shelters, skilled nursing facilities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cases will increase and resources will be much more impacted,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Public Health Officer Henning Ansorg urged Santa Barbarans to stay at home as much as possible and to “assume the virus is in your community, assume you are at risk for contracting it and take actions to stop the spread.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant rise in cases is expected over the next days and weeks, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t really anticipate the exact numbers or over what period of time they will occur, but we are really feeling comfortable that we can meet the demand,” Ansorg said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff-Coroner Bill Brown said at the press conference that “the vast majority of people” in the county are adhering to the statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect on Thursday evening, but that repeat violators of the order could be cited, arrested and jailed, “particularly if a violator has been made aware of the order and continues to violate it.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a person or group of people willingly continues to break the public health order, they could be charged with a misdemeanor crime and they could be cited, and in certain repeated or egregious cases, they could be arrested and jailed for noncompliance,” Brown said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first tactic for officers in enforcing the stay-at-home order will be an “explanation” of the order and a “warning,” as Brown noted that some of those who have not complied with the stay-at-home order were previously unaware or confused about the restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown added that the number of law enforcement calls, medical service calls and arrests reduced significantly over the weekend, but said there has been an uptick in domestic disturbances since the stay-at-home order was placed.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emergency fund — which started with $56,250 and aims to help cover temporary housing, moving and storage costs due to the coronavirus pandemic — is being distributed through an </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQ9Qq5uclcuej1fcm9qj5nN-9Xpcb0chETLrhrUs9W42YBKQ/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to determine each student’s level of need. The maximum a single student can receive is $300. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emergency fund consists of remaining funds the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) would have spent on spring programs had the coronavirus pandemic not occurred, according to IVTU Chair Alex Young. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of April 15, the IVTU has conditionally approved $55,800, roughly 99% of its total available funds, for 186 out of 294 applicants, Young said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Moving can include gas costs for moving home, renting moving vehicles, hiring a moving company, moving supplies, and plane or train tickets to fly home; Storage costs include renting a storage unit; and Temporary Housing includes expenses such as hotel, motel, or Airbnb costs,” Young said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the conditionally approved aid is distributed, the fund will have just $450 left, but Young said he is expecting to receive additional funding over the next two weeks from the Associated Students (A.S.) External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office. He did not specify how much the IVTU expects to receive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EVPLA Christian Ornelas said in an email that his office has “set aside about $3-4k should [IVTU] need more money,” and that “The uncertainty of this whole situation has put people in a tough spot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the IVTU, institutions throughout I.V. and the UCSB community have worked to abate the economic blow that the coronavirus crisis has dealt to students. The UCSB Graduate Student Association created a coronavirus relief </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the A.S.

And there’s a lot of students; if we’ve got a lot of people [securing housing in the fall], this could get really, really complicated,” Unander said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-19/isla-vista-tenants-union-creates-emergency-coronavirus-fund/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-19/isla-vista-tenants-union-creates-emergency-coronavirus-fund/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-19/isla-vista-tenants-union-creates-emergency-coronavirus-fund/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-19/isla-vista-tenants-union-creates-emergency-coronavirus-fund/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-19/isla-vista-tenants-union-creates-emergency-coronavirus-fund/","id":4015,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4014,4013,4012],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Searching for Suspect in Isla Vista Market Robbery","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2019-03-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The suspect fled westbound down Pardall Road but was not apprehended.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police are searching for a suspect in a robbery that happened Friday evening at Isla Vista Market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 5:30 p.m., deputies from the I.V.
