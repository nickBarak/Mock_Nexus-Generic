Admittedly, the peak of indie folk has passed, but I still find myself gravitating toward the music of The Lumineers, the three-piece at the helm of the genre.</p>\n<p>The band was formed in New Jersey, where lead singer Wesley Shultz and drummer Jeremiah Fraites first bonded over music through loss. In 2002, Fraites’ brother Josh, who was Shultz’s best friend since childhood, died of a drug overdose. The two quickly decided to do music full-time and spent seven years schlepping their way around New York City’s open mic nights. However, success proved difficult to find in New York, and the band decided to relocate to Colorado. When they arrived, the duo posted a Craigslist ad for a string instrumentalist and met classically trained cellist Neyla Pekarek, who completed the band’s permanent lineup. Soon after, they signed a record deal and were slated to record their first album the next year. The self-titled debut was released in 2012, and the single “Ho Hey” immediately topped the charts. The jangly guitars, declarations of love and bombastic shouts of the nearly inescapable track were the perfect catalyst for an indie folk revival.</p>\n<p><em>Cleopatra</em>, the three piece’s sophomore effort, is centered around a more mature sound. It was penned over the course of six months in a house the band rented in Denver. However, it stays true to their confessional-narrative style of songwriting. The Lumineers decided to take a quiet approach to the album after the dizzying amount of fame they achieved following their first album. Two months ago they released a piano-driven track, “Ophelia,” to little fanfare. The mid-tempo single does not sonically stray too far from their previous songs, but lyrically Shultz alludes to his disillusionment with fame. Following the tone set by “Ophelia,” the rest of the album is notably insular, but the band uses this to their advantage, creating a world of strong women and long journeys to live in for 45 minutes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Predictably, folk purists consider indie folk a non-genre, but the music is for people that appreciate the crossover qualities that exist in virtually every modern act. The Lumineers began the same way that many folk pioneers did: young and world-wise. More importantly, they believe in their music with the same relentless energy, which is the reason they can exist on the same playlist as Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell. The Lumineers translate the passion of their music into one of the most emotional, genuine shows a band could put on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The Lumineers play at Santa Barbara Bowl on May 28th.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

Sweater weather may be over for Santa Barbara natives, but as of this Tuesday, The Neighbourhood will be bringing it back in full force to the Majestic Ventura Theater. The show was originally booked at the Santa Barbara Bowl but made a move to the Majestic Ventura Theater, where all tickets will be honored.</p>\n<p>The two EPs <em>I’m</em> <em>Sorry </em>and <em>Thank You </em>and debut album <em>I Love You</em> respectively were the building blocks for the success of the band we as they are today. They became known for their black and white aesthetic, as seen in their scenic rotating clips for songs like “Flawless” and “WDYWFM,” along with their overall social media presence. With their appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” The Neighbourhood performed a stylish live television debut in black and white. Even after the departure of their original drummer Bryan Sammis, their status as the band to be on the lookout for remained, as did their loyal fanbase dedicated to decoding their cryptic melodies. In 2014 The Neighbourhood dropped a mixtape titled <em>#000000 &amp; #FFFFFF</em>. The mixtape consisted of several singles the band had previously released along with a few new ones featuring artists like YG, Raury and French Montana.</p>\n<p>After the release of the mixtape, however, the band went off the radar for a span of time to recover from the constant shows and festivals they had booked as well as to get to the root of what their next work of art would be. Out of this brief hiatus bloomed their sophomore album<em> Wiped Out!,</em> a fiery, complex treasure that would take all of their fans and critics by surprise. Listening to the album by its lonesome is a journey, so seeing The Neighbourhood bring it to life will be a vivid experience. There is no doubt that this band aims to please, and it would be an honor for anyone to say they were in attendance when the Majestic Ventura Theater got “wiped out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Regardless of what the details consisted of, if one were to compile a soundtrack for that summer it would include Walk The Moon’s youthful tune, “Anna Sun,” crafted as if it were made for that summer. Not just because it was named song of the summer by various publications, but because it is difficult to not associate it with breathless, unscathed memories accompanied by the feeling of lightning running wild through the heart. Walk The Moon is giving fans the chance to relive those memories and obtain several more Friday, May 27 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, supported by MisterWives.</p>\n<p>Walk The Moon is the type of band to release a song that will send your emotions spiraling, yet one tends to forget to take the time to get close with their music. There are numerous releases of good music day by day, so it makes it difficult to accomplish such a task. However, when it comes to Walk The Moon, it is rewarding to be more than merely familiar with their music; those that actually take the time to immerse themselves in their sounds might just discover their new favorite song.</p>\n<p>Similar to the love they received for “Anna Sun,” Walk The Moon received overwhelming attention for “Shut Up and Dance,” an upbeat, electric single from their latest album, <em>Talking is Hard</em>. In comparison to a number of their other tracks, the song proves difficult to sit through without singing or dancing from the heart. Out of all of their songs, both “Anna Sun” and “Shut Up and Dance” are the two that the band is commonly associated with, so one could expect to experience the joy flowing off of the stage and into the crowd as people sing in unison with every ounce of love spilling from their lungs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With our hand-held slave boxes demanding our constant attention, it can be hard focusing on what really matters: beating off.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those prophetic words of wisdom come from UCSB musician Underbelly’s informative YouTube channel, which sarcastically aids viewers with making beats of their own. These blunt videos, however, are only a portion of what the young DJ has to offer the future of music. 1,436 SoundCloud followers and counting and a new EP full of futuristic vibes, the Santa Barbara prodigy is set to take the electronic scene by storm in only a matter of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timmy Linetsky, also known as Underbelly on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, is a UCSB film major from Palo Alto, California. He started producing rudimentary beats on an MPC 500 at age 14 after hearing DJ Shadow’s entirely sampled 1996 cult classic, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endtroducing…</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Since then he has switched to commonly used production software Ableton and refined his sound to the Underbelly we know today. Along with DJ Shadow, some other influences of his are Balam Acab, Clams Casino and the revolutionary jazz/hip hop instrumentalist Flying Lotus. After years of studying the greats and perfecting his own craft, the UCSB student is ready to create some classics of his own.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underbelly recently went on a european tour with Azeem Ward and just released an extremely promising 3-track EP entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on April 19.

The dauntingly strong opening track, “Breather,” captivates its listeners with a Kali Uchis vocal sample that demands a second play. “Stingray” follows, with an intimate piano sample and steadily bouncing beat that expresses raw and powerful emotion, even without any words. The ending track, appropriately titled, “the end,” closes the EP with dreamy ambient chords that shake the listener into musical oblivion. A very thick and smooth collection, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes for great study music as well as an ambitious soundtrack for the DJ’s gradual rise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mere taste of what he has to offer, Timmy commented on the work, stating “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I hope to make a splash that reverberates far and wide in today’s music world while also testing the waters before releasing my debut album later this year.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than anything, I was just tired of keeping these songs to myself for so long and was itching to put them out there. I found three tracks that I thought flowed together in a cohesive way while also being distinct enough from one another to showcase the full range of my production style.” Although dripping with potential, this album only scratches the surface of what Underbelly has in store.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with an upcoming show at SOhO on May 26, Underbelly has plans for a full length debut album with Alpha Pup records as well as an R&amp;B collaboration album, both of which are set to drop this year. Going into more detail about the R&amp;B project, Timmy entailed, “Seriously, this guy’s voice is as thick and sweet as molasses and matches my production perfectly.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, if his new endeavors resemble anything of his past work, UCSB and the rest of the world are in for a serious treat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the name of supporting local talent and, more importantly, in the name of quality art, we strongly urge all of you to check this guy out.
