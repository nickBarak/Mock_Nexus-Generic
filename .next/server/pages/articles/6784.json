And, as with any particularly tumultuous time, it left us with some amazing music. In this special end-of-year list, the Artsweek staff reflects on some of our favorites. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Emotion: Side B</i></b><b> by Carly Rae Jepsen</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “Call Me Maybe” singer shifted from guilty pleasure pop anthems to complex stories disguised in ’80s pop arrangements. Jepsen channels the complexities of a love-struck mind into song, creating a colorful haven that is welcoming to all. Although these are unused songs from Jepsen’s 2015 project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, these B-sides highlight a sincerity in modern pop music that is often diluted, or even completely lost. With the guidance of indie-heavy hitters Dev Hynes and Greg Kurstin, Jepsen made a project full of melancholic songs that could instantly become the soundtrack to the next independent coming-of-age film. The track “Cry” accentuates the downfalls of unrequited love with inviting synths, no doubt an influence from Hynes. The disco pulse radiating from the ’80s in “Body Language” had people singing the chorus in the shower in a matter of time. There is no need to put your Spotify on a private session when listening to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotion: Side B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; this is an album that no one should feel guilty about listening to. Jepsen deserves more recognition for her ability to transform from one-hit wonder status to the same realm as imaginative indie-pop artists like Sky Ferreira. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Rodriguez</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service </i></b><b>by A Tribe Called Quest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legendary jazz-rap maestros A Tribe Called Quest reunite for their swan song with their first album in 18 years, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your service</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The group’s sound has aged like a fine wine, and their influence is all over the modern rap game, which is full of jazzy beats and lyrics that celebrate blackness. The group even acknowledges this on the song “Dis Generation” which passes the torch from the old guard to the new vanguard of hip-hop music shouting out “Joey, Earl, Kendrick and Cole.” Another example of the group’s sound being perfect for 2016 is the politically charged lead single, “We The People….” With divisions between people being a huge part of the rhetoric of the last election season, this track fights back emphatically. The chorus, for example, rails against the rhetoric of people like Donald Trump who believe that black, Mexican, Muslim and gay people are “bad folks” who “must go.” A Tribe Called Quest instead sells a message of unity with the track from the opening lyric, “We don’t believe you ’cause we the people,” by drawing on the language of our constitution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the standout tracks, it’s impossible to talk about the album without mentioning the recent passing of founding member Phife Dawg in March. The group does an amazing job celebrating the life of The Five-Footer throughout the album by incorporating Phife’s raps recorded before his death and the emotionally charged tribute, “Lost Somebody.” As Tribe calls it quits with their final album, don’t feel that you’ve lost a great rap group; instead, celebrate that they went out with a banger. As for Phife Dawg, “he’s in sunshine.”</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Splendor &amp; Misery </i></b><b>by clipping</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The experimental, noise-rap trio led by 2016 Tony Award winner and frontman Daveed Diggs is back with one of the strangest releases of the year. According to their label, Sub Pop, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Splendor &amp; Misery</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an Afrofuturist, dystopian concept album that follows the sole survivor of a slave uprising on an interstellar cargo ship and the onboard computer that falls in love with him. If that doesn’t sound like a unique album, then I don’t know what does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thematically, clipping analyzes blackness in the modern age by catapulting it into the future and the past at the same time. The protagonist, the slave from the future Cargo 2311, comforts himself by rapping over the clangs and buzzes of the spaceship itself, and this is reflected beautifully by William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes’s instrumentation that transport the listener to the noisy ship perfectly. The album makes many allusions to the past through choral renditions of African-American slave spirituals and tackles universal themes of loneliness and existentialism as the main character suffers anxiety and depression as a result of constantly feeling on-the-run. These futuristic ideas have a basis in our modern age, but the Cargo 2331 passenger comforts himself by reasserting his roots through rap music and slave spirituals. This is reflected in today’s America, where black artists are reasserting their identity through their music in an environment that can feel hopeless with systemic injustices. </span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Blackstar</i></b><b> by David Bowie</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Bowie did something amazing with his final album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Of course, it is his last album because he sadly passed away in January. However, what is truly remarkable about Bowie as an artist is that he used the pain of the cancer he eventually succumbed to and awareness of his own mortality to make his art. With </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackstar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he solidifies his nearly 50-year legacy as one of the most unique artists of the last century. Not only is the subject matter innovative and unique as Bowie explores his own death, but it’s a testament to Bowie’s constant evolution as an artist that this album sounds very distinct from his previous work. He fully embraces jazz experimentalism with this album, despite being a rock legend. Additionally, with Bowie being older, he has adapted his music to highlight his weathered voice by focusing on the timbre of his vocals and the haunting mood that they create throughout the album. Overall, this album was a legendary send-off for a legendary man and artist. As Bowie tells his fans and loved ones on the song, “Dollar Days,” “Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you.” And we won’t forget you either. Rest in peace, Starman.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Blonde </i></b><b>by Frank Ocean</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most anticipated album of the year, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the follow-up to Ocean’s acclaimed 2012 debut into alternative R&amp;B stardom, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">channel ORANGE</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. On this album, Ocean continues doing what we love him for: being himself. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">features Ocean bearing his heart and soul on his sleeve as he sings about unrequited love, depression and other events from his life. The project features some of the most emotionally charged vocals and lyrics of the year as Ocean’s raw humanity shines through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the intensity of emotion and imagery throughout the album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is rather minimal. So minimal, you might not notice that Beyoncé, perhaps the most well-known modern pop artist, sings background vocals on “Pink + White” or any of the other understated features including sad Swedish rapper Yung Lean on “Self Control.” And that’s without mentioning the myriad of other artists on the album including James Blake and Pharrell Williams. This style allows Ocean’s voice to take center stage without wasting any energy on superfluous instrumentation. However, there is one feature that stands out above the rest: André 3000 on “Solo (Reprise).” André 3000 brought so much energy in his one-minute-long feature that people are begging him for a new album. This is for good reason, as “Solo (Reprise)” was, in this writer’s opinion, the best guest feature of 2016. This moment of intensity does well to inject energy into the album while keeping the focus on Ocean’s minimal style that pervades the other tracks. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have taken a while to finally come out, but any Frank Ocean fan will tell you that the wait was worth it, as he released one of the best records of the year.</span></p>\n<p>— Ryan Hykes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>ROCKISDEAD</i></b><b> by Dorothy</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They may have named their album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but in 35 minutes the members of Dorothy prove that rock remains alive and thriving. Old school without feeling overdone, the quartet’s debut record comes packed with infectious clapping beats, blues-inspired guitar riffs and even hints of country all centered around lead singer Dorothy Martin’s powerhouse vocals. Even if you can’t quite belt with the same ferocity as Martin, it’s hard to resist singing along with her hooks. So go ahead and put on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROCKISDEAD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> next time you’re on a drive; wail your heart out about what a wild and reckless rock star you are. </span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Teens Of Denial</i></b><b> by Car Seat Headrest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirteen albums in, Will Toledo and the rest of Car Seat Headrest show no signs of winding down. In fact, with their latest release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they’ve only picked up speed, so buckle up and take a listen. Appearing on multiple music publications’ best-of-2016 lists, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeds in its ability to make you feel okay with not being okay. The record offers an honest take on often-heavy topics including clinical depression, but the music never strays into cynicism, maintaining positive and hopeful sounds throughout. If you’re looking for a feel-good take on the low points in life or even just some catchy lo-fi rock tunes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teens Of Denial </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is waiting for you.</span></p>\n<p>— Melanie Voskanian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>City Club </i></b><b>by The Growlers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of the twisted beach carnival vibe created in The Growlers’ </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot Tropics, City Club</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels more like watching a five-piece downtown Vegas casino house band while peaking on acid, Raoul Duke style. In lieu of Sinatra covers, they’re playing “I’ll Be Around,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and it’s a little confusing, but there’s nothing wrong with being disoriented sometimes. That is what is so special about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to me. While 2016 has been a time of questionable changes and uncertainty, The Growlers keep it fresh while staying true to their roots. It’s fun, romantic, weird and different from anything else out there. The Growlers are a comforting reminder that all hope isn’t lost. In a genre that has become increasingly derivative, no one else can even do a quality job at ripping them off. With the aptly titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City Club,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Growlers move away from the surf rock stylings that made up the bulk of their work. Tunes like “Beach Rats” and “Burden of the Captain,” which previously defined their style now morph into “Night Ride” and “Rubber and Bone.” This transition hasn’t happened all at once and doesn’t isolate die-hard Beach Goth festival fans. It’s a diversification of The Growlers, and it’s rad.</span></p>\n<p>— Sean Edwards</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>A Moon Shaped Pool </i></b><b>by Radiohead</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English alternative lords Radiohead released their ninth studio album in 2016, and it was a gentle reminder that they are still relevant and ever-powerful influencers of music culture. Entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the album is an ethereal blend of soft droning melodies and piercing lyrics that evoke such profound emotion from mundane words. Thom Yorke has always had a unique ability to speak simply but wholly capture exactly what you’re feeling. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does this just as well as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK Computer </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bends, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and worms its way into your mind. It relates itself to everything that’s been swirling around your brain, getting deeper with every play. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels like classic Radiohead: a little inaccessible, but that’s the point. There isn’t a Radiohead album that is immediately easily digestible; they all require active thought to really enjoy. Just like jogging through a museum, a half-assed listen may leave you confused and a little sweaty. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moon Shaped Pool </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reveals something new or makes you feel something different with every listen. It becomes a distorted reflection of internal processes, and Yorke’s blunt lyrics still leave room for creation of your own context. Radiohead once again slipped under our skin and delivered 11 tracks to make us think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Sean Edwards</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Malibu</i></b><b> by Anderson .Paak</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hip hop fans have been waiting for Anderson .Paak for a long time. For years, we have been left struggling to prove the true musicality and talent required to excel in our beloved art form. We could point to Kendrick Lamar for his lyrical wizardry, or Dr. Dre and his command of modern technology in production, but there was no one with undeniable musical greatness. With the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the live shows that followed, Anderson .Paak has changed all of that. A Grammy nominated album recorded on an old laptop and dented microphone, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> features a mix of soulful singing and rapping over instrument-based beats with samples from the likes Hiatus Kaiyote or fully original tunes curated by .Paak and his longtime band, The Free Nationals. Additionally, .Paak is completely redefining the standard of hip-hop live shows. While many rappers only feature a hypeman and a DJ, .Paak’s live show is music being played almost entirely live. Paak himself brings an unmatched energy with his bold personality, quirky outfits and astounding drumming capabilities (these aren’t Bieber drum fills, they’re jazz fills!). At the end of 2016, .Paak, The Free Nationals and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malibu </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have brought some much-needed funk and soul pizazz to hip hop all the while raising the bar for what it means to be a performer.</span></p>\n<p>— Daniel Carroll</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><i>Cardinal</i></b><b> by Pinegrove</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The natural inclination of people in their late teens and early twenties is to be apathetic. Whether it’s a dead-end job, rough times in school or even a hangover, there will always be a mild feeling of dislike within close reach. Pinegrove, folk-punk’s latest prodigy, captures this feeling with both wit and self-awareness on their debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardinal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “How come every outcome is such a comedown?” lead singer Evan Stephens Hall sings in a tone both sardonic and earnest on the lead track “New Friends.” The exact genre of Pinegrove’s music is hard to pinpoint, dipping into the sensibilities of modern pop-punk, toying with elements of folk and even hinting at a country twang. Music’s current state is one that has no boundaries, and this is a band that is aware of the greatness this can bring. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p>\n<p><b><i>Holy Ghost</i></b><b> by Modern Baseball</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Split between lead singers Brendan Lukens and Jake Ewald, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an 11-track confrontation of depression, loss and past loves. If you listen to the album on shuffle, the two frontmen act as a foil to one another. Ewald’s side is bold, while Lukens’ side is dark. Ewald grew up in a religious household, so tinges of those memories appear in his lyrics at times, most apparent in his wry mention of a girl who is “sipping from that holy cup.” Lukens’ mental health battles are approached directly, “always looking back on my mistakes and others’,” he sings at one point. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the band’s third album, and their growth is clear in the way they continuously dig deeper into themselves without over-exploiting their own struggles. </span></p>\n<p>— Zoe Jones</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74665\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74665\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-04/74665/","id":6784,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6783,6782,6781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[6548,6554,6633,6642,6643,6784,6943],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Max Goldenstein Serenades Batcave","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-9.09.51-PM-e1460018142359.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-9.09.51-PM-e1460018142359.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"On the bright Sunday morning of March 6, the Daily Nexus was joined by Isla Vista musician-slash-rugged heartthrob Max Goldenstein for a session in the Batcave.

You folks may know him as the front man of local garage rock group Sun Daes, frequent headliners at the backyard parties and park concerts you know and love. Their voluptuous, groovy sound has made them one of I.V.’s most memorable bands, accommodating equal amounts of jiving and thrashing from their listeners.</p>\n<p>However, Max has a budding and ambitious solo career as well; with material up on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/max-17\">Soundcloud</a> and <a href=\"https://aqualounge.bandcamp.com/releases\">Bandcamp</a>, his extremely varied style blends elements of electro, psych, folk and lounge music into a heady brew of sonic delight. His quick wit and merry, easy-going disposition come out in his lyrics to great effect, and anyone who’s spent more than a month in I.V. should be able to relate to his words. We sat down to an interview together, after he’d finished playing:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: So, how does playing on your own differ from playing with the band? Is there one you like more than the other?</p>\n<p>Max Goldenstein: No … no, I don’t think so; they both have different things about them that are good and stuff that’s bad. We’re all great friends, so it’s amazing playing and being up there [with them] and there’s definitely a groove you can get into. When you’re in a band, though, it’s not just your sound, it’s all of yours; you have to be willing to compromise. When I’m on my own, though, there’s definitely … there’s a freedom that comes with that. I can explore my own ideas for songs and lyrics and all that.</p>\n<p>DN: Have you ever thought about picking up a backing band or something like that?</p>\n<p>MG: I have, yeah, but there are problems you run into. It basically means finding people — drums, bass, whatever — who don’t have a problem taking more of a backseat position. They have to be okay with playing <em>your</em> music. What that means, I think, is that the band probably shouldn’t be their central thing — their only thing. I’m still looking right now, actually. Can you actually put that in the article?</p>\n<p>DN: Yeah, of course.</p>\n<p>MG: Thanks.</p>\n<p>DN: Do you think you want to keep on doing music as a career?</p>\n<p>MG: Well sure, I mean, that’s the dream, right? I’d love to spend the rest of my life in the studio and playing shows and touring and shit — all that stuff’s really … I really enjoy it. But being able to share my music with other people — with the world — that’s what’s important for me. The music scene, it’s a really hard place to continuously make money in, so a lot of what I’ve been thinking about is how to make money, at least enough to live on, while I can keep writing and performing. So having a job that I like, something cool — that’s why I’m in marine bio — to pay for food and rent and all that so I can do what I really want in my own time; I think I’d be fine with that, too.</p>\n<p>DN: Definitely, yeah. I know that’s something a lot of people here are wrestling with. Taking things back into more of a local view, what do you think is unique about being a band in Isla Vista, as opposed to someplace else?</p>\n<p>MG: I think … I think it’s really unique to be in a community made up almost entirely of inspired kids who not only want to have fun, but are trying to go after their passions. The arts scene here, it’s really special. I’ve met some of my favorite people here and I’ve seen some crazy shit. I don’t think you could go anywhere else and find the same number of — and how huge they are —the parties and shows around here! It’s a fucking crazy place to be in a band. There’s always somewhere you can play.</p>\n<p>DN: And for either you yourself or the band, do you think living in I.V. has shaped your sound at all?</p>\n<p>MG: Oh definitely, yeah. It’s like I was saying: I.V.’s such a unique place that it makes for really great inspiration; there’s plenty of song material here. It’s also a brilliant place for just fucking around, and we do a lot of that and I feel like that’s reflected in the music we make.</p>\n<p>DN: Nice, nice. And now while our readers do love to hear about the music, they also want the dish. So I gotta ask, what were you listening to in middle school?</p>\n<p>MG: Oh god. Uh, gimme a sec … Avenged Sevenfold, I guess? Rise Against? All that shit … I think I had one Slipknot song at one point.</p>\n<p>DN: My Chemical Romance?</p>\n<p>MG: Hahahaha, oh sure, yeah.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/","id":6781,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6780,6779,6778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ten Songs for the Turkey Drop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/turkey.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/turkey.png?resize=724%2C609&ssl=1","description":"If you were a victim of the Turkey Drop, the excitement of seeing your significant other back home after months away at college turned to crying by a leftover turkey sandwich when they said it wasn’...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many of us return to UCSB after Thanksgiving filled with dreadful thoughts about Dead Week and looming final papers, some of us are also suffering from the all-too-common heartbreak known as the Turkey Drop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were a victim of the Turkey Drop, the excitement of seeing your significant other back home after months away at college turned to crying by a leftover turkey sandwich when they said it wasn’t working out.

If you’re one of those people that had a mutual breakup and are still getting along well with your ex, you can take comfort in the fact that things could be a lot worse for you. It’s bad enough getting broken up to face to face, but hearing about your partner cheating on you from someone else is infinitely worse. I hope you aren’t in the same situation legendary soul singer Marvin Gaye croons about in this tune, but at least when your roommates hear you blasting this song, they will know how horrible your ex was. And, they’ll probably take it easy on you if you don’t help out around the apartment for a few days.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPnZZTVp_2A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”  by Hank Williams</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the John Green quote goes, pain “demands to be felt.” Hank Williams actually wrote this song when he was having relationship troubles with his first wife, so you can tell he must’ve been in a tough place. So when your pain demands to be felt, just sing, “As I wonder where you are, I’m so lonesome I could cry,” as you actually do cry into the half-eaten pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WXYjm74WFI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Self Control” by Frank Ocean</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This standout track from Ocean’s stellar 2016 release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was written about a relationship that ended. In a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feature, he says about the relationship, “We just couldn’t really relate. We weren’t really on the same wavelength.” This song has beautiful metaphors that anyone struggling in the aftermath of the Turkey Drop can relate to. As you reflect on what could’ve been, “sometimes you’ll miss it, and the sound will make you cry,” and that’s okay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. “Roses” by OutKast and “Fuck You” by Ceelo Green</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay enough with the sad stuff! Not every good breakup song is sad! These catchy songs from Atlanta-based artists will help with that third stage of grief known as anger. “Roses” is all about how André 3000’s ex, Caroline, was not as good as she thought she was, and I have a feeling Big Boi and André 3000 got their frustrations out in the expletive-filled outro. If that wasn’t enough, there’s also the second song in this pair, “Fuck You.” Not only is this song a great breakup song, it’s also catchy as hell and will probably get you dancing enough to forget that you were sad in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWju37TZfo0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pc0mxOXbWIU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. “Flesh Without Blood” by Grimes</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amazing Canadian singer-songwriter delivers this track off of her amazing 2015 release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Art Angels</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This catchy and fun song explores a different side of breakups: not caring anymore. A fact about the track is that while it’s a great song about breakups, Grimes has said that her inspiration was about a falling out between friends, which can be just as painful as a falling out between romantic partners.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv9YoYCKNoE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. “Eventually” by Tame Impala</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is another side to the Turkey Drop: Feeling a lot of mixed emotions. This song by Australian psychedelic-genius Kevin Parker and crew is only one song from an entire concept album about the singer’s breakup with his longtime girlfriend. Take comfort in Parker’s words, “I know I’ll be happier, and I know you will, too, eventually,” because with luck and holiday leftovers, both you and your ex will be.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHe8kKO8uds?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor and “Make Your Own Kind of Music” by Mama Cass</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tracks are perfect for when you’ve finally accepted your breakup and are ready to move forward. Of course, no great list of breakup songs could exclude “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor. This iconic track is practically an anthem for the dumped masses of the world. The other track is less known, but no less powerful and possibly one of this writer’s favorite songs ever. Here, Mama Cass sings the 1969 pop version equivalent of “do you, boo boo,” and it’s amazing. At the end of the day, “there’s only one song worth singing,” and that’s your song. One day you’ll sing the lyrics to these classics and mean it and know that you’re ready to move on.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBR2G-iI3-I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbSM02_1k34?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” by The Velvet Undergound</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now that you’ve gotten through the worst of it and your friends are getting pretty annoyed with your drama, you can start looking toward the future. You may be pretty jaded after your experience with the Turkey Drop, but it’s important to remember that there’s someone out there who will recognize all the amazing things about you. This track is one of the greatest love songs ever written, because when you find someone who reflects, “the beauty you are,” you’ll realize that all the struggles of your Thanksgiving heartbreak were worth it in the end.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXETLPCogao?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ten-songs-for-the-turkey-drop/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ten-songs-for-the-turkey-drop/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ten-songs-for-the-turkey-drop/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ten-songs-for-the-turkey-drop/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/ten-songs-for-the-turkey-drop/","id":6782,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6781,6780,6779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Extravaganza 2016 Lineup Revealed","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-Reveal-ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-Reveal-ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A.S.
