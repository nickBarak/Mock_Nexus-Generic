Oh man, oh man. Not again. Drake came back with his heavily anticipated </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “playlist,” which means Twitter and Spotify may need to increase bandwidth to accommodate the massive influx of traffic for the foreseeable future. The lengthy follow-up to the 6 God’s fourth studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Views</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, features some heavy-hitters such as Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Travis Scott and more. The project is eclectic and dynamic, providing listeners with a little taste of every side of one of pop culture’s most captivating figures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank Ocean once asked, “What’s a king to a god?” Well, in 2017, content is king, and Drake is a self-proclaimed god (of the 6 variety). So to answer your question, Frank, in the context of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-era Drizzy, the king is everything to the god. Twenty-two tracks is Drake’s longest project to date. It could take months to consume all of that content. And it will. It’s all part of the plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake is a calculated artist. We must not forget that when the rest of the rap game sleeps, the 6 God schemes. And plots. All of this on the low, of course. He is a poster child for post-modernism; in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘s 80-minute lifespan, he crosses over to pop, switches back to rap, reveals insecurities, displays confidence and even borrows cultural accents. By calling the project a “playlist,” he grants himself immunity and freedom from the pressures of typical album expectations.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tsunami of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reviews will have already clogged your newsfeed by the time this is published. Don’t pay attention to most of them. Too many internet-dwellers simply turn a first impression into an arbitrary letter grade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reviewing the work of an artist as big as Drake, there is a major “micro vs. macro” distinction that must be addressed. A micro-level review pits an artist’s new release against his/her own discography, while a macro-level review compares a new project’s quality to that of recent releases from other contemporary artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the most part, today’s Drake-related micro-level reviews would suggest that he can’t win. Just take a look at the Fifth Estate’s reaction to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Views</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite its unprecedented streaming success, the album caused many to long for an earlier incarnation of the artist. Old projects like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Care</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing Was the Same</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> set the bar high and left the door open for new releases to be overly scrutinized. Yes, some nostalgia-laden Drake reviews touch on valid points, but as with any bias reporting, viewer discretion is advised, at least to some degree.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is within the macro-level arena that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> evaluations can easily garner positive acclaim. Drake has become a master recording artist as both a singer and a rapper; he delivers contagious melodies and captivating flows. His unmatched versatility as a vocalist allows him to successfully execute multiple styles. From rap to R&amp;B to dancehall, he does it all on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and he does it well. There is a track for everyone, which is a major feat in and of itself. Name another rapper who can achieve such wide-ranging appeal … Now cue the crickets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the irresistibility of Drake’s content is largely due to the holistic quality of his compositions. Executive producer and long-time collaborator 40 delivers a signature OVO sound on a handful of the project’s tracks. Boi-1da, T-Minus and Nineteen85 are a few more usual suspects on the production side of the operation. Within today’s popular music climate, an all-star caliber personnel, like the one backing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, provides the closest thing to a satisfaction guarantee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, whether or not you’re a Drake fanatic, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is certainly worth your attention. But there is a right and wrong way to consume this project. Adopt the macro-level scrutinization mindset and you will not be disappointed. Drake has delivered one of the best collections in recent memory and perhaps the most exciting release of 2017.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/","id":6696,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6695,6694,6693],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[5922,6696,6724,6772,6856,6864,6914],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Local Favorites Clean Spill Come to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12717810_936935369729500_887328006303710947_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12717810_936935369729500_887328006303710947_n.jpg?resize=960%2C639&ssl=1","description":"As Santa Barbara natives, the amount of feedback they received from the crowd was not only expected, but well-deserved.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I watched members from both Clean Spill and The Buttertones pace back and forth throughout the room, faces gleamed at the sight of their existence, and I, too, was overcome by the emotion that caused us all to gape in unison. The crowd was filled with seemingly familiar bodies all bent on making the most of their post-adolescence. From the grunge attire to the wavering course of conversation that struck the air, it was evident that this show attracted a particular scene. SOhO is home to an array of sounds, yet it often sees bands like Clean Spill leaving the comfort of Isla Vista and making a home on stage at their venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clean Spill took the stage with lead vocalist Pat Curren capturing the center of the room in a bright red turtleneck, exhibiting the sort of confidence heard in his voice. He was visibly calm and collected, projecting any amount of anxiety he could have on to the crowd through a baffling amount of talent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Santa Barbara natives, the amount of feedback they received from the crowd was not only expected, but well-deserved. As someone who has seen the band numerous times, I have yet to hear them perform an identifiably similar setlist. Aside from songs like “Sid” and “Come Around,” their music can be exceptionally challenging to find via most music streaming platforms, so it is common for people to only know those particular songs. While one may come to hear a particular song, they may not only hear it but also experience something better. The band performed a song that I had yet to hear, knocking the crowd off of their feet and into something dressed to sound a little bit like love. After closing my eyes to make the most of this feeling, I opened them to see several people in the room doing the same.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Clean Spill ended, The Buttertones began an alternative journey through the soundtrack of an aching romance for their first-ever show in Santa Barbara. Each member took the stage decked in their own twist to their stylish attire, spouting sounds of angst and words of love. Watching them perform, drenched in the colors of the disco ball that orbited the space above them, aided to the art of their melodic, hopelessly romantic appeal, which caused the couples in the room to slow dance as if their hearts were on fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They brought a bit of everything to their set with old-school harmonies, saxophone and a combination of everything in between. Although furthest from the crowd, drummer Modesto “Cobi” Cobiån was perhaps the most enjoyable to watch as he drummed like there was a world inside of him.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the sound of dueling pianos, pounding percussion and blaring horns, the rhythm of cheerful tapping feet and clapping hands filled the theatre. In the dim light of Campbell Hall, I could see smiles and mouths agape in awe and after every song or hear people gasp and whisper words of astonished praise. This kind of reaction comes from an appreciation of a time-honored American tradition: a celebration of 20th century culture and the musical legacy of people from across the nation. At the finale of UCSB’s Jazz series, artists Aaron Diehl, Adam Birnbaum and Cécile McLorin Salvant brought that musical tradition to life.</p>\n<p>UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures concluded a collection of jazz performances on Tuesday night with “Jelly and George: Celebrating the Music of Jelly Roll Morton &amp; George Gershwin.” The event featured a group of prominent contemporary jazz musicians, including Diehl and Birnbaum on the piano and Salvant as the ensemble’s vocalist. The performance showcased some of Morton and Gershwin’s more obscure jazz compositions, written at the beginning of the jazz age in the 1910s and 1920s.</p>\n<p>“These are two very important American composers,” Diehl explained, “but they never knew each other. I imagine if they did, they would be what we would call ‘frenemies.’”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The “Jelly Roll Blues” demonstrated the dynamics of Morton’s music with growing volume and complexity throughout the piece. The song began with the dual pianos, Diehl and Birnbaum, joining in counter melody. Birnbaum’s hands flowed down the keys, creating a sound effect like something falling. Diehl countered the other pianist’s flair with high, magical-sounding trills. The song transitioned to a steadier, more forceful rhythm as Paul Sikivie increased his volume on the bass.</p>\n<p>Lawrence Leathers on the drums gave the song a New Orleans vibe with heavy use of the snare. The southern jazz style was complete as three other musicians on trombone, trumpet and clarinet emerged from backstage, playing with clear, bright tones.</p>\n<p>The next Morton song, “Sidewalk Blues,” used the full ensemble to create a different musical atmosphere. The song began with Leathers blowing a train whistle and honking a car horn, while the rest of the musicians shouted and called to each other from across the stage. The cacophony of noise mimicked the soundscape of a downtown city street. The song transitioned from a steady beat that built with the whine of the trumpet to a peaceful, lulling duet between trumpet and clarinet, like a leisurely stroll. The soothing melody was continuously interrupted, however, by the train and car sounds. Through music, the band was able to recreate the environment of urban 20th century America.</p>\n<p>As Salvant took the stage, the audience roared with excitement, signifying her presence and success within the jazz community. Low, pounding piano began the song “I Hate A Man Like You,” creating a dark, angry tone. Salvant’s vocals started off slow and sassy, getting higher and more nasal, as though mocking someone. As the song continued, her voice grew louder and deeper with stylishly retro vibrato and rich, full low notes. She grinded her voice fiercely at the beginning of the third verse, mirroring the song’s spiteful lyrics. Her vocals carried the emotional weight of the song and told its story through inflection.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76321\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"495809154\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76320\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76321\" data-attachment-id=\"76321\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/aarondiehl_cecilemcloransalvant_930x400/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=930%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"930,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?fit=888%2C382&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76321\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400-250x108.jpg?resize=250%2C108\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"108\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AaronDiehl_CecileMcLoranSalvant_930x400.jpg?w=930&amp;ssl=1 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Kuumbwa Jazz</p></div>\n<p>The tone of the performance changed completely with the next number, “Black Bottom Stomp.” Diehl felt that the piece “combines the best of New Orleans and Chicago jazz.” The clip-clopping percussion complimented the upbeat and cheery melody with Brandon Lee blasting high notes on the trumpet. Diehl and Birnbaum’s piano solos recalled the ragtime style with energetic and quick piano chords and a mixture of both high and low notes.</p>\n<p>After the whirlwind of the upbeat tune, Corey Wilcox thrilled the audience with an elaborate trombone solo. The number was filled with anticipation as Wilcox began with low, vibrating tones and slowly began to climb to higher notes. The other band members began clapping along and shouting words of encouragement as the trombone wailed through clear, high notes. Wilcox demonstrated his control of the sound with trills and stylistic wavering in the notes. After each sustained wail, audience members gasped and a few even hooted with approval. When the piece ended, the crowd went wild with applause and whistles.</p>\n<p>The final song, “I Got Rhythm,” served as a reminder of jazz’s role in American popular culture. The number started with a deconstructed melody, with each instrument playing a fragment of the familiar tune. The band members comically interacted with each other, Leathers using his train whistle and car horn again, while Evan Christopher squeaked out high notes on his clarinet. The musicians hollered and shouted at one another and began the upbeat, catchy tempo with heavy percussion and a steady baseline. Salvant returned to the stage with a clear, sweet voice as she sang the nostalgic lyrics with a friendly smile. The entire band finished together with one final appreciation for jazz music and jazz culture.</p>\n<p>The show inspired both admiration and awe in audience members as the crowd leapt up in an immediate standing ovation after the finale. Music lovers of all ages buzzed with excitement and words of praise as they left the theatre, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of jazz on the entire country. This final installment of the Jazz series represented the legacy of musical talent: combining classic music with new prominent artists.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76320\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76320\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/diehl-and-salvant-conclude-ucsbs-jazz-revival/","id":6694,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6693,6692,6691],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rising Duo Joyzu Bring Bright Sounds to SB","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103725_1871483653063170_206836207472671305_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103725_1871483653063170_206836207472671305_n.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While witnessing Joyzu play live at M8TRX nightclub, the one thing that stood out most was the joy they shared on stage, which their stage name aptly foreshadows.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a cold Thursday night, a packed crowd filled the dimly lit dance floor at M8TRX nightclub in downtown Santa Barbara. The club goers were rowdy and ready for Joyzu to play their set. Many were there because they were familiar with the duo’s name but weren’t sure how they would perform live. As the two small-town kids took over the reins, a Joyzu remix of “We Will Rock You” by Queen started to play. With heavy themes centered around trap styles, the build up to the song established high-tension energy in the room. Suddenly, the carbon dioxide cannons filled with cold air fired off on the dance floor as the drop hit. The lights, lasers and specially made Joyzu graphics danced and supplemented the beat and drops in breathtaking fashion: they came to rock the people of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joyzu, an EDM music group from the small town of El Dorado Hills, Calif., features two young producers, Carson Willms and Quinton Pope. At the respective ages of 22 and 21 years old, the two small-town kids have already built an impressive résumé that is making big-city crowds take notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After releasing their hit single “Hear You Say,” the group gained momentum, even garnering major-label attention. Willms and Pope, as you know now, are not your typical college DJs, but are your common college students. Willms and Pope attend college, work jobs, occasionally talk to girls and are busy making their way through the EDM music scene.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been best friends ever since middle school, but got into dance music around the beginning of high school,” Willms and Pope said in a joint interview.  “We fell in love with the genre so much that is pushed us to pursue production and DJing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The love and passion they share for the music definitely shows in their product. While witnessing Joyzu play live at M8TRX nightclub, the one thing that stood out most was the joy they shared on stage, which their stage name aptly foreshadows. The duo danced around on stage, head banged and threw their hands up and down as epic beats dropped on their audience in epic fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Joyzu had so much fun with their music, the crowd responded with relentless energy. Of course the music itself was incredible, but the true difference was the distinct feel in the crowd once Joyzu took the stage and started playing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are many inspirations that inspire us to keep pursuing music. One being our favorite artists that we look up to who continue to push boundaries, such as Porter Robinson, Skrillex, Zeds Dead, What so Not, Chance the Rapper and Childish Gambino, just to name a few,” they said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of their artistic influences can be heard in their music. Still, the music Joyzu produces maintains a unique sound that must be heard to fully understand. As someone who admittedly does not listen to much EDM music, their music can best be described as high energy, with amazing drops that are not too over the top — a nice change of pace from the music of most electronic duos. The music is also complemented with precise vocals and lyrics that extend the energy of the music even further. The music itself, let alone the incredibly fun atmosphere the two producers create, will leave you wondering how these guys get paid to have this much fun. Next time they are in town, which may be sooner than you think, do not miss the opportunity to see two young kids from a small town in California live out their dreams.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76489\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76489\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-15/rising-duo-joyzu-bring-bright-sounds-to-sb/","id":6695,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.
