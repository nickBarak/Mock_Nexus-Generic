Really, I am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those people had to suffer through 52 years of brutal heartache and 147 seasons played in professional baseball, basketball, football and even hockey since winning their last title. Hell, the last time they won a trophy was when the Browns took the victory in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, two years before it became known as the Super Bowl. It was about time they have something to celebrate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And celebrate they have, after the Cavs, led by superstar LeBron James, won their first NBA title in NBA history. Riots in the streets; fights breaking out; people jumping up and down on cars, hanging on streetlights and lampposts, breaking bar windows, climbing responding fire engines and ambulances, stealing road signs and traffic cones, etc. etc. A lifetime of anguish for many Clevelanders was let loose in one night in a fit of terror on their own city. But, hey, they needed this.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a San Diego sports fan, I can relate.

Neither has won their current league’s title, with the Padres only appearing in the World Series twice, while the Chargers have appeared in only one Super Bowl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Padres made it to the World Series in 1984 and 1998 and got destroyed both times. In their first appearance against Detroit, the Padres stood no chance, losing the series 4-1. Their second time around they did even worse as they were swept by the Yankees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers one appearance in the Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger was an absolute blowout as Steve Young, who threw for 325 and a still-NFL-record six touchdown passes, and the 49ers cruised to an easy 49-26 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three of these championship appearances are from either before I was born or at least before I can remember. But the strongest memories I do have about the two teams I’ve loved my whole life involve similar heartache in which I witness them get close to a chance at a title and then watch that opportunity wash away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most striking and lasting impression I have of my Chargers is from the 2006 season, when the team finished with the best record in the NFL at 14-2. They were the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and primed for Super Bowl contention led by stars such as Philip Rivers and Ladainian Tomlinson and looks forward to home field advantage secured throughout the playoffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite all the hype and excitement, they then collapsed in their first game of the postseason. A startling 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots in which they committed four turnovers, three of which led to Patriots scoring drives. Despite outgaining their opponent in rushing yards and total yards as well as intercepting opposing quarterback Tom Brady three times, the Chargers’ season was cut short in catastrophic fashion.</span></p>\n<p>Not to be outdone by their football counterpart, the Padres had a heartbreaking season of their own in 2010, a year in which they were predicted to finish last in the NL West but shocked the sports world by holding strong atop the division for most of the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71846\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71846\" data-attachment-id=\"71846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/san-diego-padres-ballpark/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"645,340\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"san diego padres ballpark\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71846\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?resize=365%2C192\" alt=\"Petco Park, the home of the San Diego Padres who have two world series appearances, both losses, in team history.

It would take a monumental collapse for the Padres to blow a chance at the postseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And that is exactly what happened. The Padres proceeded to lose ten straight games into the month of September, a historic collapse that left them clinging to the top of the division by a thread.</p>\n<p>After leading the NL West for 148 days of the season, the Padres officially relinquished a playoff spot for good to the Giants with a loss on the very last day of the season. San Francisco went on to win the World Series while the Padres went home and haven’t had a winning season since.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these finishes left me reeling from a combination of grief and rage that lasted intensely for a minimum of weeks and then slowly worked into my overall emotional impression of San Diego pro sports. It’s memories like these that have left me cynical and demoralized regarding the topic, but not without hope.</span></p>\n<p>No, never without hope. The hope is what keeps me alive. Every new season without fail brings fresh dreams that maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that everything changes. Maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that America’s finest city captures its first-ever modern pro sports title.</p>\n<p>2016 probably isn’t that year. Seeing as the 2015-16 NFL season already concluded with the Chargers well out of playoff contention and the 2016 MLB season is about halfway done with the Padres mired in a sixth straight losing season, the title drought is almost assuredly extending to an extraordinary 54 years.=</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, hey, if Cleveland can finally get theirs, maybe our time is coming soon, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or maybe not.</span></p>\n<p>Just give me one before I die, San Diego.

[Tuesday’s] report by the NCAA Committee on Infractions is the result of an investigation that was conducted cooperatively by the NCAA enforcement staff and the university,” Bill Mahoney, associate athletics director of communications, said in a statement on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Barbara is disappointed that the violations happened. The University is committed to learning from the process and continuing to promote student-athlete welfare and competition with integrity as core values of the university’s athletics department.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the track program, a former head coach, who was with the program for over 30 years and is not named in the decision, was found to have violated restrictions on “countable athletically related activities,” otherwise known as CARA. The only head coach who was with UCSB during this time was the former Head Coach Pete Dolan, according to UCSB’s website. Dolan was fired from the position in June 2018 and later filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the decision, the head coach expected student athletes to “log their training activity” during “summer months outside of the playing season and the required weekly day off during the season</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hich is prohibited under NCAA rules, according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He actively monitored these logs, provided feedback on the student-athletes’ training, and in some instances admonished or otherwise disciplined student-athletes who did not complete their logs,” the decision states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the head coach was actively involved in the logs, and the training activity was “not initiated or requested solely by the student-athletes,” the NCAA considered his activities “impermissible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the men’s water polo team, the head water polo coach “impermissibly facilitated housing for one of the student-athletes who wanted to come to Santa Barbara prior to his enrollment and compete on a local water polo club team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach during that time was Wolf Wigo, who is currently employed by the university, according to UCSB’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NCAA committee found that this led to other restricted recruiting inducements, including free meals and transportation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach were found to have improperly compensated two international student-athletes, who are not named in the decision, with “a monthly stipend that equaled the exact amount of their rent and transferred the payment directly to the student-athletes’ landlord.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two student-athletes were employed at a water polo club co-owned by the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach, and were paid “significantly higher” rates compared to the hourly rates of other student-athletes working in similar positions at the club, according to the decision. The two student-athletes were also found to have been occasionally paid for “work not actually performed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Tuesday’s decision, the head track coach involved is now subject to a one-year show-cause order, which follows him to any NCAA institution that he may be employed by or affiliated with between Nov. 5, 2019 and Nov. 4, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Should the head track coach become employed in an athletically related position at an NCAA member institution during the one-year show-cause period, the head track coach shall be suspended from 30 percent of the season’s contests,” the decision writes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the NCAA decision, the head and assistant water polo coaches are subject to two-year and one-year show-cause orders respectively, which prohibit them from a number of coaching duties during their show-cause order time periods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach, who was found to be “personally involved in arranging a recruiting inducement and providing extra benefits in the form of improper compensation and pay for work not performed,” is prohibited from all off-campus recruiting activities during this two-year period, which is applied to any NCAA-affiliated institution that they may be employed by during the period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head coach is also suspended from the first 30% of the season’s contests during the first year of the show-cause period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The provisions of this suspension require that the head water polo coach not be present in the facility where contests are held and have no contact or communication with men’s water polo coaching staff members or student-athletes during the suspension dates,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The prohibition includes all coaching activities for the period of time that begins at 12:01 a.m. on the day of the contest and ends at 11:59 p.m. that day. During that period, the head coach may not participate in any coaching activities, including, but not limited to, team travel, practice, video study, recruiting and team meetings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the results of any contests during this suspension will not count for the head coach’s coaching record.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the assistant water polo coach’s show-cause period, they are to be suspended from 30% of the season’s contests, a suspension that will be served after the head water polo coach’s  suspension from the first 30% of the contests is served. The provisions of the assistant coach’s show-cause period are the same as the head coach’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the penalties on the coaches, UCSB is placed on probation for two years, beginning Nov. 5, 2019, and ending Nov. 4, 2021, and is required to pay a fine of $5,000 “plus one percent of each of the budgets for the men’s water polo, men’s cross country and women’s cross country programs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track and men’s water polo programs are also required to put limitations on their recruiting visits and reduce the scholarships they give out, based on previous self-imposed restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of the penalties listed in the decision are self-imposed, including the men’s water polo team abstaining from participating in post-season conference and NCAA tournament competition during the 2018 season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since two student-athletes involved in the water polo program violations are now considered ineligible, UCSB is required to vacate all “regular season and conference tournament records and participation in which the two ineligible student-athletes competed from the time they became ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Further, UCSB’s records regarding its men’s water polo program, as well as the records of the head men’s water polo coach, shall reflect the vacated records,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the other self-imposed restrictions, which occurred while the NCAA investigation was occuring, included the men’s water polo coaching staff being barred from recruiting communication with prospective international student-athletes from April 1, 2018, through Dec. 31, 2018, other than the student-athletes who had already verbally committed to or been signed by UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with the track program, “UCSB reduced CARA by four hours per week for cross country student-athletes and track and field student-athletes who are also on the cross country squad list.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also required track program athletes to take two days off per week from CARA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During UCSB’s probation period, the university is required to “develop and implement a comprehensive educational program on NCAA legislation to instruct coaches, the faculty athletics representative, all athletics department personnel and all institutional staff members with responsibility for recruiting and certification legislation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, they must submit a report to the NCAA committee by Jan. 15, 2020, informing them of their implementation plan and schedule. They must also file annual compliance reports by Aug. 30 of each year of probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Particular emphasis shall be placed on rules education and monitoring related to CARA and student-athlete employment,” according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All student-athletes prospects must also be informed of UCSB’s probation status, and UCSB must “publicize specific and understandable information” about the infractions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once UCSB submits its final compliance report, and before the probation period is concluded, Chancellor Yang must also send a letter to the NCAA “affirming that UCSB’s current athletics policies and practices conform to all requirements of NCAA regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omar Hernandez contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

We all know the greatness of Duncan. We know about the five rings, three Finals MVPs, 15 all-star appearances, two league MVP awards and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of such a decorated and honored career most people, including myself, can also come to the conclusion that Duncan is the greatest power forward to ever live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He was the star of a team that, for 19 years, displayed constant greatness year in and year out. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spurs never missed a playoff series during his 19-year career and have maintained a winning percentage never less than .610. Duncan is also only one of two players in NBA history to win an NBA title in three different decades (the ’90s, ’00s, ’10s).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Duncan a true superstar is the fact that he never acted like or was treated like one. He never caused controversy — except for when it came to his disdain over his favorite referee, Joey Crawford — and never wanted to be in the spotlight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duncan wasn’t “sexy” like these other superstars. I mean, seriously, what’s sexy about the nickname “The Big Fundamental.” It’s no “King James” and it certainly is no “Black Mamba,” but it’s representative of him, and that’s what makes it special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was only one thing he cared about: winning. And in this day and age in which loyalty has become overrated and players are constantly seeking a bigger market to expand their brand, it’s refreshing to know that there was a player who truly looked beyond superficiality and simply wanted to play the sport he loves with his beloved teammates, coaches, and city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Kobe Bryant had to make his exit from the NBA known to the world by jacking up 50 shots and scoring 60 points — that’s why we love you, Kobe — it was fitting that Duncan’s way of leaving was to make a quiet exit toward stage right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Clipper fan, I know Duncan will always have a special place in my heart, seeing as how he constantly used to rip it out in the pre-Chris Paul days. From 2003-2010, the Spurs and The Big Fundamental beat the Clippers in 26 of 27 match-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ups including an 18-game winning streak from 2006-2010.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard being a Clipper fan — trust me, I can attest — but it’s only made harder when there’s one team and one guy in particular who continually beat your team quite handily.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71892\" style=\"width: 287px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71892\" data-attachment-id=\"71892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-12/farewell-to-a-big-fundamental/29906170001_3624585928001_screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"539,374\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=277%2C192\" alt=\"Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of Associated Press\" width=\"277\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?w=539&amp;ssl=1 539w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of <em>Associated Press</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why when the Clippers beat the Spurs in that playoff series in 2015 and Chris Paul made that game-winning shot in game seven over Duncan, my life as an NBA fan was, in a way, complete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know it’s not the same as winning a championship — and believe me, the next round is still painful to talk about to this day — but finally seeing the team I love to get over the hump against the team I despised most was truly satisfying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My hate for Duncan was simply out of respect for the man and his craft. I hated that he wasn’t a Clipper, winning all those games and championships for us, but I loved the man he was on the court and respected the man off of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching Duncan lose that series against the Clippers was like seeing my favorite cartoon hero defeat his enemy for the first time. And yet, watching Duncan retire is like watching the final episode of that cartoon; it really feels like my childhood is over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess that’s why No. 21’s decision to retire really gets me at an emotional level. But as the other constantly heard cliché goes, all good things must come to an end. Just like every great player that has walked away from the game during my lifetime, I’ll get over it. But I’ll never forget the greatness that is known as Tim Duncan aka the Big Fundamental.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks for the memories, Tim, and I can’t wait to watch that Hall of Fame induction speech in 2021.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
