With 40 seconds left in the game and UCSB up by a point against Hawaii, nine seconds remained on the shot clock. Vincent knew he had to gamble.</p>\n<p>Guarded man-to-man, he saw a lane, zoomed past his defender, split past two more defenders and set his feet at the top of the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Then he rose up with two guys on his grill, threw up the shot falling away and banked it in. He did it with grace and ease despite all that could have gone wrong.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The bucket was the game-winner in the Gauchos’ 75-74 victory that marked a turning point in the season. UCSB would go on to win six of its next seven games after that to put the team where it is now, a half game behind UC Irvine for second place in league.</p>\n<p>In the postgame press conference afterward, he spoke with ease not seen in most 18-year-old freshmen that have just won the game for their team. He made light of the magnitude of the discombobulated play with teammate Zalmico Harmon.</p>\n<p>“That’s what [Harmon and I] run before practice,” he joked.</p>\n<p>Listed at 6’3” and 190 lbs., Vincent has the physique of any normal Division I basketball player, though his talent is far above that. Becoming the first true freshman to start a season opener for UCSB since 2008, Vincent’s sharp shooting and all-around facets of his game have made him an instant-impact freshman on a team in position to win the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I can do a little bit of everything, but shooting is probably my best attribute,” Vincent said. “I try to facilitate, I try to do all those little things, so my game is pretty rounded, but it could definitely get better without a doubt.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58751\" style=\"width: 346px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1592021322\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61585\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58751\" data-attachment-id=\"58751\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/ucsbs-shooting-overwhelms-mustangs/cameryn-brockdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?fit=1145%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1145,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3100\",\"caption\":\"(Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus)\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415608129\",\"copyright\":\"Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"(Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus)\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"(Cameryn Brock/Daily Nexus)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?fit=179%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?fit=733%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58751\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?resize=336%2C469\" alt=\"The son of two psychologists, Vincent did not begin to take basketball seriously until the sixth grade.

Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Vincent will need to get better when — not if — he becomes the best player on the team in the years to come. He’s only a few months removed from his senior year of high school, yet he plays like a senior with plenty of poise. He’s had to: to handle the pressure of making a game-winning shot, to have made his collegiate debut on the road against college basketball powerhouse Kansas, to start right away at the off-guard position on a team loaded with veterans.</p>\n<p>The youngest of three siblings, he grew up with parents that sometimes brought their work back home. Both his parents are psychologists, an experience Vincent described as “different”.</p>\n<p>“They’re in my head constantly without me even knowing it,” Vincent said. “… They know the answer before I can even answer it most of the times.”</p>\n<p>His parents had the right read on their son’s talent for basketball as well. Since he was in the sixth grade, Vincent began playing AAU ball, travelling to play in competitions.</p>\n<p>He split time playing for St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif. and the Oakland Soldiers on the AAU circuit. It was with the Soldiers that Vincent took the next step to improving his game, playing alongside another talented freshman this year, Arizona’s Stanley Johnson, and against players such as Duke’s Tyus Jones.</p>\n<p>Vincent’s place as the starting shooting guard was cemented before he even committed to Santa Barbara, according to Head Coach Bob Williams. He impressed the coaching staff that much. The problem was convincing him UCSB was the right place.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t really interested in Santa Barbara at first because I heard about the whole party scene,” Vincent said. “It didn’t seem businesslike at first.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were lobbying hard for him, he was wielding offers up and down the West Coast his junior year of high school. Offers from the University of Portland, Pacific and Utah State came in. In total, he was offered scholarships from 10 different schools, but not until he visited UCSB did his perspective on the campus change.</p>\n<p>“I just fell in love,” Vincent said. “As soon as I took my visit I said this is where I wanted to be.”</p>\n<p>With persistence from Assistant Coach Ryan Madry, Vincent signed in late September 2013 and proceeded to average 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.1 steals as a high school senior.</p>\n<p>Now with only Saturday’s game against Cal Poly left in the regular season, Vincent has for the most part shed the mistakes he was committing early in the season. What has helped his transition is how quickly he’s gelled with the team. In the season opener against Kansas in front of 16,300 screaming Jayhawks fans, it was just him and his teammates on the court.</p>\n<p>“I was still able to understand everyone on my team. It was almost as if I had been around them enough to that they were the only voices I heard,” Vincent said. “… The crowd just seemed like white noise.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60650\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1591443251\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61585\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60650\" data-attachment-id=\"60650\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-09/late-run-gives-ucsb-thrilling-win-over-hawaii/the-gaucho-defense-holds-back-hawaii-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"The Gaucho defense holds back Hawaii.

Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>This season has seen him demonstrate his future potential. Against No. 22 Southern Methodist University in Dec., he knocked down the game-tying three pointer that sent the game into overtime. His best game offensively came Wednesday night at Hawaii, where he scored a career-high 25 points on 8-13 shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>It is not surprising to hear how Vincent talks about his role as the team gets ready for the Big West Tournament next week. He knows the one-and-done nature of postseason play and realizes he needs be ready when the time comes.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing for something else, so it makes everything more important. It raises the stakes,” Vincent said. “I just think it’s import for everyone to embrace their role and not fight it.”</p>\n<p>So what keeps one of the frontrunners to the conference’s Freshman of the Year honor grounded? <em>Eyes to the sky</em>. That’s Vincent’s motto to remind him how he got here. He anticipates he might be the future of UCSB men’s basketball.

The six rebounds were a season-high for Jemerigbe to go along with 11 points and six assists. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler posted career-high totals with 17 points and two three-point makes.</p>\n<p>It was all UCSB to open the first quarter as the Gauchos shot 69.2 percent from the field and 4-for-5 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>The inside-outside game of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter was in full effect. Porter continued her hot shooting from the last two games, starting 3-for-3 from behind the perimeter. She would end the game 3-for-4 from the field and play just 10 minutes after enduring an apparent shoulder injury.</p>\n<p>Playing a major role in the Gauchos’ commanding start was their defense as Hawaii ended the period with five turnovers, in which UCSB capitalized off of with 11 points.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing by double-figures 23-9, it was the shooting of junior guard Sarah Toeaina that kept Hawaii within range of reducing its deficit all game. She went 3-for-6 in the first period, signaling the start of her finishing with a game-high 22 points on a 10-for-19 shooting afternoon.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second period, no basket was made by either team until the 6:41 mark for UCSB on a jumpshot by Toler to give UCSB a 25-15 lead.</p>\n<p>She was the Gauchos’ most active player in the period, scoring another basket as a result of a quick stop and go move to surpass the defender for a go-ahead layup and later earned a chase down block before eventually being subbed out.</p>\n<p>Toeaina remained the Rainbow Wahine’s primary source of offense with a jumpshot to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 27-21.</p>\n<p>With under two minutes remaining in the period, the Gauchos got back to feeding Edelman down low as she scored layups in the team’s last two possessions.</p>\n<p>A crucial three-pointer by sophomore forward Lahnia Salanoa brought Hawaii to its lowest first half deficit of five points, 31-26, to go into halftime.</p>\n<p>Jumpstarting Hawaii’s offense to its 7-2 run to open the second half was freshman guard Julissa Tago with a three-pointer and midrange jumpshot along the baseline. Tying the game at 33 apiece was Toeaina’s layup with 8:06 left in the third.</p>\n<p>Despite her reduced role this season, junior guard Makala Roper provided a quick surge off the bench with a three-pointer to end the tie and put UCSB up 36-33.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB maintained a lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Roper’s shot ignited the Gauchos’ 12-4 run that led to Hawaii calling a 20 second timeout.</p>\n<p>Providing a scoring outburst during the run was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez which included back-to-back three-pointers, increasing UCSB’s lead to 45-37, she scored all eight of her points in the quarter while shooting 3-for-5 and 2-for-4 from deep.</p>\n<p>Hawaii took advantage of UCSB’s scoreless play in the final 3:54 of the third as Toeaina would score two consecutive layups to help the Rainbow Wahine enter the game’s final period down 50-45.</p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, UCSB looked like the team it was to open the game as its grittiness was on full display as it embarked on an 8-0 run. Its offense was most efficient in the period, shooting 72.7 percent and 50 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>An offensive charge led to the Gauchos’ first possession. Scoring five of the eight was Edelman, putting her pivot foot to work and posting up for a turnaround AND-1 layup in which she converted at the foul line.</p>\n<p>Scoring the other three in the team’s next possession was Jemerigbe’s drive and circus layup that fell as she drew a foul that led to her making a free-throw to increase Santa Barbara’s lead to 58-45.</p>\n<p>A three-point make by Toler extended UCSB’s run to 11-3, but responding with a three of her own was senior guard Briana Harris to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 61-51.</p>\n<p>But the three-point shot wouldn’t be Toler’s last as she scored 10 points straight to give UCSB a 68-57 advantage.</p>\n<p>A quick jumpshot by Toeaina trimmed Santa Barbara’s lead to 66-57, but the Rainbow Wahine were unable to draw any closer as time continued to expire.</p>\n<p>With a 10-point lead of 68-58, helping secure the Gauchos’ 74-62 win was the veteran leadership of Jemerigbe. With the ball at the top of the key as time went by, Jemerigbe drove the right lane for a layup, came up with a steal in the game’s lasting seconds, and was clutch with a 4-for-7 finish at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>With its three-game home stand now over, UCSB will be on the road at Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, Jan. 25. The game will begin at  7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-wins-fourth-straight-tied-for-first-in-conf/","id":408,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[407,406,405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fall Season Continues With ITA West Regional Championships in San Diego","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The top four players on the UCSB women’s tennis team competed in the 2010 ITA Southwest Regional hosted in San Diego, Calif. this weekend.

Due to poor weather conditions in San Diego, the final was moved to Los Angeles and played at USC Marks Stadium.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB failed to advance far in the tournament, the Gauchos scraped a couple wins against the best competition they will see all season. In the opening round of the singles bracket, freshman Kiersten Meehan didn’t allow her opponent to score in the first set, defeating Pepperdine sophomore Tara Panu in straight sets 6-0; 6-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Pepperdine usually has a good team, it was good to beat one of their girls,” Meehan said. “Regionals are a big deal.

If they all do that they’ll get a chance to make the NCAA singles.”</p>\n<p>One Gaucho in particular will be looking to continue to build his name up on the national stage. Sophomore Ben Recknagel made it to the Round of 16 a week ago at the ITA Regionals, beating USC’s 90th-ranked Peter Lucassen, along the way. If he continues to play well against nationally ranked players, he will earn a ranking of his own and a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We know he’s going to play one of the [players who makes it past the qualifiers] on Thursday,” Davis said. “That’s always tough because they have already played a couple games. If he wins that he then has a rematch with Peter Lucassen, who he beat at Regionals. It’s a tough draw psychologically, but we’re looking for him to win this thing.”</p>\n<p>Despite the implications of the potential match, Recknagel is not concerned.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously going to be tougher to beat him a second time around,” Recknagel said. “He’s going to prepare for me differently now that he knows I’m good. I know how to play him so I just hope I can beat him again.”</p>\n<p>The tournament will consist of 32 players from schools including UCLA, USC, UCI, UCSB, Denver, Loyola Marymount, BYU and UCSD. USC’s Daniel Nguyen, the #1 seed and runner-up of the ITA Regionals, will also be participating. Sixteen players, including Recknagel and senior Alex Konigsfeldt, will automatically be accepted into the main draw, while the others, including senior Evan Jurgensen and junior Alexander Johnson, will play qualifying matches on Wednesday to determine if they will make the main draw.</p>\n<p>“The level of competitions in the qualifiers is going to be high,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>There will also be a doubles bracket, Recknagel pairing up with Konigsfeldt and Johnson with Jurgensen. Doubles play was a weak point for the Gauchos in the ITA regionals, and they need to step up this week if they want to hold on to a chance to make the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to see somebody pop,” Davis said. “We’re going to continue to experiment with pairings and hopefully we’ll find somebody this week. We think that Alex and Evan could be a good pair.”</p>\n<p>This five-day tournament comes just a week after the grueling, six-day-long ITA Regionals, and some people might be worried that fatigue would be a problem for the Gauchos. However, neither Davis nor Recknagel are worried, and both are certain that it won’t be a problem.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody’s feeling a lot better,” Davis said. “The guys made it and survived midterms. I think we’ll feel a lot better psychologically this time.”</p>\n<p>The first matches for the Gauchos will be Jurgensen’s and Johnson’s qualifying matches Wednesday morning. Johnson will face UC Irvine’s Steven Henderson while Jurgensen faces Tyler Loong of BYU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/","id":410,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[409,408,407],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
