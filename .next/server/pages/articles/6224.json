What I mean by that is that we tend to define moments in our lives not by some sort of objective measure of exactly what happened, but by the way we felt while we were doing it. Instead of remembering the exact details of shows like “Ben 10,” “Johnny Test” or “iCarly,” I tend to remember the way they made me feel: safe and happy, with my bowl of Cocoa Puffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on those shows today, I still feel nostalgic about them, but it’s hard for my adult(ish) eyes to appreciate them as deeply as I did then. A lot of these shows are racked with cheesy villains, bleh dialogue and boring, predictable plots </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— so </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s hard for me to muster up the same suspension of belief I once so easily could and hop back into a world like that. The nostalgia I feel now just isn’t enough to fill the gap left by this newfound lack of substance, at least for most shows. But there happens to be a very notable exception to this: “Avatar: The Last Airbender.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I finished rewatching the whole series after many years, and I found myself experiencing many of the same emotions I felt when I first watched it almost 13 years ago: a deep, breathless fascination with the world of the Four Nations and an authentic emotional connection with each of the thoughtful and multifaceted characters. And now, as a semi-adult, I realize just how brilliantly this so-called “kids show” told a compelling and deeply moving story about war, genocide, conquest, honor and most of all, redemption without taking itself too seriously or relying on blood and gore. I truly think it’s one of the best animated shows ever made and a shining example of what great storytelling looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story is set in a world in which the people use martial arts to “bend” the four elements: water, earth, fire and air. (In story writing terms, this is a fairly “hard” magic system, in which the rules and costs of using magic are pretty tightly and explicitly defined. Compare this to a “soft” magic system, like the Lord of the Rings universe, in which magic is a mysterious force used by equally mysterious characters with few explicit rules. More on this </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVrnfniQiS8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each group of benders formed a nation around the art of bending their element. Each nation, in a pretty slick story writing move, is designed with characteristics, a value system and culture that centers around the traits of their element. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Avatar, in this world, serves as a guiding force. He/she is the only person with the ability to master all four elements and is tasked with using this immense power to maintain peace in the world. Yet the Avatar mysteriously disappears, and in his absence, an increasingly militant Fire Nation decides to “share their prosperity” with the rest of the world and sets its sights on total world domination. Without seeing any blood or gore, we are shown the results of the ensuing genocide: the entirety of the Air Nomads have been wiped out, the Water Tribe has been crippled and the Earth Kingdom is under heavy siege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been a hundred years since the war began and the Fire Nation is close to victory, until two siblings, Katara and Sokka, discover Aang, who is revealed to be the Avatar. After seeing what the world has become in the Avatar’s absence and what happened to his friends and teachers, Aang vows to learn the other three elements, take on the Fire Nation and restore balance to the world. Katara and Sokka join Aang on his quest and are pursued all around the world by Prince Zuko: a relentless, arrogant and banished prince from the Fire Nation who’s been told that the only way he’s going to be welcomed home is if he captures the Avatar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In building these characters, the show gives a deeply personal account to the consequences of war: the shattering of lives, the depth of the human capacity for evil and the ability of a humble and courageous individual to find hope. I could spend hours talking about all the brilliant characters in this series, but I want to focus on two in particular that created one of the most satisfying redemption stories I’ve ever seen: Prince Zuko and his uncle Iroh.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning of the show, Prince Zuko is exactly what he sounds like: a complete asshole. He’s callous, rude and reckless, often willing to cross any lines necessary (including endangering the lives of his ship’s soldiers) to have his royalty restored. He has a completely backwards sense of right and wrong, and on first glance, he seems… boring. Just a typical cynical bad guy with a bone to pick. But the show provides us with flashbacks and tells us Zuko’s heart-wrenching story.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89291\" style=\"width: 665px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2053533590\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89289\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89291\" data-attachment-id=\"89291\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/zuko/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"655,486\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"zuko\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89291\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=655%2C486\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Nickelodeon</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are taken back to a war strategy meeting in which Zuko, as the Crown Prince, sits next to his father Fire Lord Ozai. One of the generals suggests a strategy that purposely sacrifices Fire Nation soldiers to gain an edge in a battle. Without waiting for his turn to speak, Zuko angrily protests, asking how they can consider themselves leaders of the Fire Nation when they are willing to throw away civilian lives for next to nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By speaking out, Zuko is accused of being disrespectful not only to the general, but to the person who called the meeting: his own father, Fire Lord Ozai. To teach Zuko “respect,” Ozai challenges him to an Agni Kai, a ritualistic duel between two firebenders to resolve a fight. At the arena, Zuko realizes who he has to battle and breaks down in tears, refusing to fight his own father. His father sees this as an act of weakness and burns Zuko, permanently scarring his face, as well as banishing him from the Fire Nation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is here that we realize that Zuko’s arrogance comes from a deep sense of shame within him: his whole life, he was told by the world that he wasn’t enough. He is disrespectful because no one ever showed him respect or treated him like a human being. He disregards his soldiers’ lives because he was made an outcast for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to care for them</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That’s why his sense of right and wrong is so backwards: he lost his family, honor, nation and life for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to be good</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always found that the most compelling villains are the ones who you understand. You don’t need to agree with them or endorse their end goal, but if you experience their journey, you can’t help but empathize with them on some level, and both them and the story feel much more real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, Zuko finds his way back to the Fire Nation as Crown Prince, back by his father’s side. He has everything he thought he wanted: a home, a family and a nation, but he feels distressed and unsatisfied. To get here, he betrayed his uncle Iroh, the only real father figure in his life, who had begged him to look inside himself and ask if this was what he really wanted. These feelings of guilt and unhappiness overwhelm Zuko. After learning of the terrible devastation his father plans to wreak on the world, Zuko realized that this identity of a fierce, proud and loyal Fire Nation prince was an identity that was handed to him and not his own. In pursuing his redemption, Zuko never stopped to consider if the future he was fighting for was a good one, or if he </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even really wanted it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Zuko went on his hunt for the Avatar, he journeyed across the Four Nations. He didn’t see a world grateful and awed by the Fire Nation; he saw a world terrified by it. He saw the consequences of his terrible actions and the harm they had caused. Zuko decides that no matter his past, it’s his duty to do whatever he can to end the war. In a jaw-dropping turn, he asks Aang for forgiveness and asks to teach him firebending and help him defeat his father. He finds his uncle, and in one of the most emotional scenes in the show, begs for his forgiveness. Iroh, teary eyed, hugs him, saying, “I was never angry with you. I was just sad because I thought you had lost your way. But you found it again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most beautiful messages in “Avatar: The Last Airbender” is this: making mistakes doesn’t mean you’re an unworthy or bad human being. It just means you’re a human being. Instead of continuing to lie to himself and the rest of the world about who he was, Zuko decided to own his mistakes and use the strengths he had to humbly guide the world in a better direction. He wasn’t a hero in spite of his mistakes; he was a hero </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because of</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his mistakes, and what he learned from them. In doing so, he became greater than any of us could have ever imagined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its beautiful animation style to its inspiring story, this show presents to us the brutal consequences of war and ideology, the capacity of humans to do great good as well as great evil and the importance of mistakes and humility. This could have been a much, much longer review, but suffice it to say that “Avatar: The Last Airbender” has a message many of us could really use right now. It asks us to make a genuine effort to understand each other’s stories and not hate others (and perhaps more crucially, ourselves) because of mistakes that are made. Yes, there are awful people in the world, but refusing to let contempt cloud our emotions can be the difference between a broken and a healing society. Overall, I love this show with all my heart, and I’m a better person because of the lessons it taught me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10/10 – Masterpiece</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89289\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89289\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/","id":6224,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[6223,6222,6221],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit","biography":"Not available","articles":[4113,5725,5735,6224,6262,6573,6588],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Measure S Raises Taxes, Creates Slush Fund","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So just what is Measure S for?

The present budget would be divided according to the number of prisoners in North County so the county would not need to have a sales tax increase.  The buses carrying those prisoners to North County courts every day will not be needed.  The county general fund can cover any added expenses.</p>\n<p>The proposed Measure S is supposed to be “protected” by an “Oversight Committee.” However, as with Measure A, the committee is loaded with people selected by the supervisors of like mind, so the members of the committee will just stamp everything as “OK.”  On balance, there is no need for Measure S if our elected officials would get off their hands and make an effort for the taxpayers instead of giving us “the sky is falling” routine.</p>\n<p>NO!

I am not going to bother</div>\n<div>explaining why such a statement is implicitly racist; rather, I</div>\n<div>will move on to explain why Palestinians in Gaza do not have</div>\n<div>access to proper medical services.</div>\n<div>You see, Gaza has been subjected to a siege imposed on</div>\n<div>Gazans by both the former Egyptian government (thus,</div>\n<div>Israel’s staunch support for its now-ousted dictator) as well</div>\n<div>as by the Israeli government; both Egypt and Israel “share”</div>\n<div>(a characterization not at all appropriate given that the</div>\n<div>Palestinians are completely left out of the equation) borders</div>\n<div>with Gaza. From 2005 until now — as well as during</div>\n<div>Operation Cast Lead, which killed 1,400 Palestinians and</div>\n<div>injured around 5,000 — Gazans have been denied freedom</div>\n<div>of mobility to cross these borders. Medical equipment has</div>\n<div>also been barred from entering Gaza; in effect, infringing</div>\n<div>upon the right of Palestinians to maintain their hospitals and,</div>\n<div>thus, their health and livelihoods.</div>\n<div>On Feb. 10 of this year, Israeli strikes destroyed a medical</div>\n<div>storage building as well as damaged a school in Gaza. This</div>\n<div>is just one instance of a consistent attempt on the part of the</div>\n<div>Israelis to hinder development and undermine the building</div>\n<div>of infrastructure in Palestine (Gaza included) to aid the wellbeing</div>\n<div>of those who are essentially living in an open-air prison</div>\n<div>facility. It is one of many instances that demonstrates the</div>\n<div>perpetuation of an environment where the needed resources</div>\n<div>to create self-sustainability and an economy on which they</div>\n<div>are able to thrive is denied</div>\n<div>to them. The Palestinians are</div>\n<div>unwanted, as their existence</div>\n<div>makes evident the nature of</div>\n<div>the Israeli state as a colonizing</div>\n<div>entity carrying out an ethnic</div>\n<div>cleansing of the indigenous</div>\n<div>people whose lands they have</div>\n<div>stolen.</div>\n<div>As Laila el-Haddad puts it,</div>\n<div>“So long as those in power in</div>\n<div>Palestine are not willing collaborators</div>\n<div>in their own imprisonment,</div>\n<div>the consequences will</div>\n<div>be fierce: Institutions will be</div>\n<div>destroyed, development and</div>\n<div>prosperity will be blocked</div>\n<div>and the pretext will always be</div>\n<div>security.” To elaborate, Time</div>\n<div>magazine’s Tim McGirk</div>\n<div>reported that Israel was blocking</div>\n<div>medical aid from reaching</div>\n<div>Gaza and shed light on the</div>\n<div>case of Bassam al-Wahedi,</div>\n<div>who was in need of serious eye</div>\n<div>care. The equipment needed</div>\n<div>to conduct “complicated surgeries”</div>\n<div>was and continues to</div>\n<div>be barred from entering Gaza.</div>\n<div>Al-Wahedi was offered medical treatment by Israel if he</div>\n<div>agreed to work for the Israelis. Collaborate with us for two</div>\n<div>weeks, they told him, and we’ll get you the best Israeli doctor</div>\n<div>out there. If he refused to collaborate, he would be denied</div>\n<div>access. Al-Wahedi could not bring himself to collaborate</div>\n<div>with the Israeli state to aid his people’s oppression. He</div>\n<div>recounted that “his father, an ambulance driver, was clearing</div>\n<div>away wounded Palestinians after a battle when he was shot</div>\n<div>dead by an Israeli sniper.” This is yet another example as to</div>\n<div>why Palestinian medical services are “inferior” to those of</div>\n<div>their colonizer, the Israeli state.</div>\n<div>The bombing of Palestinian hospitals by the Israeli</div>\n<div>Defense Force during Operation Cast Lead contributed to</div>\n<div>the lack of available medical care within Gaza; this should</div>\n<div>go without saying. Of course, all this contradicts the pretty</div>\n<div>portrait of the Israeli state painted by the various authors of</div>\n<div>the many pro-Israel pieces that have been published by the</div>\n<div>Nexus; there is an assumption within all these pieces that</div>\n<div>Palestinians are to be blamed for their suffering; that their</div>\n<div>suffering is somehow warranted by the fact that Israel is</div>\n<div>an ally of the U.S. and an example of “Western progress”</div>\n<div>and “civilization.” One of the founders of Zionist thought,</div>\n<div>Theodor Herzl, would have been proud. He, too, asserted</div>\n<div>that Israel would act as “a rampart of Europe against Asia,</div>\n<div>an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism.” It is telling</div>\n<div>to know that many supporters of Israel have followed the</div>\n<div>racist tradition of Zionism, as they use Eurocentric concepts</div>\n<div>of industrial “progress” and technological innovations to justify</div>\n<div>a massacre. God help us in a world where massacres are</div>\n<div>embraced as civil and ethnic cleansing is considered an act of</div>\n<div>progress.</div>\n<div><em>Noor Aljawad is a second-year Middle East studies and feminist</em></div>\n<div><em>studies double major.</em></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/","id":6222,"author":{"id":591,"name":"Noor Aljawad"},"related":[6221,6220,6219],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Call to Action: Let’s Win Back Our Floatopia From Santa Barbara County","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hey, what a surprise, another Santa Barbara tradition is going down the toilet: Floatopia.

We lost Halloween to the cops and out-of-towners; it seems terrifying to even try to leave your house that week. And now it looks like we are going to lose Floatopia to the Santa Barbara county. Pity. But here are the facts: We destroy the beach, invite way too many people from out of town, get hammered and have the GREATEST FUCKING TIME OF OUR LIVES.</p>\n<p>Last year’s “Floatopia,” if I can even call it that, was a bust. But I learned something very important I would like to share with all of you UCSB students. I talked to someone who enjoyed Floatopia as much as I used to: a police officer. Yes, a cop. I was as shocked as you are now.</p>\n<p>“The reason Floatopia was not a go this year was because you were unable to get a permit from the county,” the officer said to me. “They are trying to play hardball with you students, and shut down the event forever. They are trying to control [students] and what you wish to do.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The next thing he said to me is what I wish to pass on to all of you students.</p>\n<p>“If you want to have Floatopia, your [A.S. Program Board] needs to talk to the county of Santa Barbara and say this: We are going to have Floatopia on the first week of April, or every weekend of April and May if we have to. You choose,” he said. The police officer went on to explain if we can annually get the permit for one day a year (not two or more) we will be able to have the event. But, if the county officials keep playing hardball with us students, like they did last year, we will have Floatopia every weekend until they give in. And I’ll tell you the reason why: MONEY.</p>\n<p>The county cannot afford to pay police officers and coast guards for overtime on this event multiple times a year. It is way too expensive. That being said, if the A.S. Program Board threatens this, we can have our Floatopia. If the county still refuses, we rally the troops, as they say. If they don’t give in, we will have Floatopia (or last year’s Streetopia equivalent) for a full month, even two if we have to. What else are we doing on Saturdays, drinking at home? This will stretch the county budget thin and they will give in, unable to afford the cost of keeping up with us. It is very simple, and I doubt many people would object to doing what Santa Barbara students do best: party.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/","id":6223,"author":{"id":596,"name":"Bobby Henry"},"related":[6222,6221,6220],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
