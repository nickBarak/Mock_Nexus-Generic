In just his second season as head coach, Andrew Checketts has guided his team into the playoffs. The Gauchos made a major push in the final two months of the regular season to capture a tie for second place in the Big West and earn a bid in the 64-team NCAA Baseball Championship.</p>\n<p>“This is kind of like a dream come true,” senior third baseman Marc Venning said. “I transferred from University of Arizona two years ago and they won the National Championship the year after I left, so I’ve had to live with that. I’ve always wanted a taste of Regionals, so this is like a dream come true and I wouldn’t go back and change this for anything.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who enter the tournament at 34-23, received an at-large selection to participate in the Corvallis Regional hosted by the Pac-12 winner Oregon State, who finished the year 45-10. On the road in neutral ground, UCSB will take on Texas A&amp;M in the first game of the round.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We are just going to get ready to play like we would any other weekend and get ready for Texas A&amp;M,” Checketts said. “This should be fun because going up there is my alma mater and my boss Mark Massari’s last job was with Oregon State, so this should be a lot of fun; there is a lot of family up there.”</p>\n<p>At 32-27 and 13-16 in the SEC, the Aggies enter the regional as the second-seeded team behind Oregon State. The Gauchos are the third-seeded team above University of Texas at San Antonio from the Western Athletic Conference.</p>\n<p>The Regional will take place in double elimination format, with games ending June 3 before the Super Regional hosts are announced.</p>\n<p>The two teams head into this regional tournament riding very different ends to their seasons. The Gauchos have won their last six weekend series in a row with the last being a sweep of UC Davis to help push them into the postseason.</p>\n<p>The Aggies, however, scuffled with the end of their schedule losing five straight games from April 20-27. However, a 7-3 record in May gave them the final push they would need.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M heads to Oregon having just played in their first ever SEC Tournament. The Aggies went 2-2 over their four games in Alabama, starting off hot with two wins, including one against No. 1 seeded Vanderbilt, but eventually dropped two in a row for elimination.</p>\n<p>The two teams are likely to throw their aces at one another to take game one of the tournament. That means UCSB will put sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone on the bump. Pettibone has been the workhorse of the Gaucho staff and of the Big West conference. He has thrown 110 innings this season, the most in the Big West, and has a 9-3 record. The right hander has thrown at least eight innings in his last three starts.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M is likely to throw sophomore Daniel Mengden on Friday. The right-hander from Houston holds an 8-4 record on the season with a 1.84 ERA in 15 starts this year. Mengden has thrown nearly 50 more innings than any other pitcher on the Aggies staff, as he too has cleared the 100 innings pitched plateau.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies are set to kick off the Corvallis Regional with a noon game scheduled at Goss Stadium, the home of Oregon State in Corvallis. Following their game will be UT San Antonio and Oregon State at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version o this article appeared on page 1 of May 30, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.<br>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/","id":4688,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4687,4686,4685],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Falls in Close Game to No. 8 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8441.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8441.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team’s prospects of making the postseason have seemingly disappeared with Tuesday night’s loss to No. 8 UCLA, 2-1.

Junior left fielder Joey Epperson led off the game by getting hit by a pitch. With the leadoff man aboard, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon executed a sacrifice bunt to move the base runner into scoring position with just one out.</p>\n<p>Number three hitter sophomore Woody Woodward had a productive out as his ground ball to third still managed to advance Epperson to third on the play. With two outs and a runner on third base, sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa did what he does best and drove in the go-ahead run with a base hit into left-center field.</p>\n<p>Before the Gauchos could attempt a two-out rally, however, Kuresa was caught stealing second base to end the inning, and about all the offense the Gauchos would muster all night.</p>\n<p>“We were trying to trick them with a delayed steal,” Checketts said. “We actually had them and it would have worked, but the pitcher missed and the throw was up almost like a pitchout and the catcher was able to see it. I think if it was a different pitch he would have been safe at second.”</p>\n<p>The Bruins would come back to tie the game in the bottom half of the second inning. Junior shortstop Pat Valaika led off the inning with a triple into right-center field. A follow-up single by junior second baseman Kevin Williams would score Valaika and tie the score 1-1.</p>\n<p>Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome worked his way out of the second-inning jam thanks to an inning-ending double play and eventually got locked up in a pitchers duel as both starters settled down after shaky early innings.</p>\n<p>The Bruins freshman starting pitcher Cody Poteet was able to shut down the surging Gaucho offense Tuesday evening. Poteet went six strong innings, allowing just one run on one hit with just one walk and three strikeouts. Jacome pitched strong as well, but was not quite as stellar as he allowed two runs through five and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t get a lot of hits and we didn’t execute,” Checketts said. “We knew it was going to be a low-scoring and detailed game but we weren’t able to get an out on a bunt and that hurt us. We had a chance to win 2-1 or 1-0 but we didn’t get an out on a bunt play.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will finish up the regular season this weekend with a three-game series on the road at UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51517\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51517\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/","id":4685,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4684,4683,4682],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Davis, Secures NCAA Tournament Bid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_Magali-Gauthier_05.28.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_Magali-Gauthier_05.28.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the final series of the 2013 regular season, the UCSB baseball team executed exactly what was needed to make their final playoff push.

The Gauchos secured a sweep of UC Davis winning 10-5, 8-1 and 5-3. The sweep secured the Gauchos second place in the Big West Conference and on Monday morning, they were voted into the NCAA Baseball Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We are excited about the playoffs,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We were on pins and needles going into the selection show. It didn’t go quite how we expected. It felt like we were deserving and a team that could do some damage. It felt like we should get in there but with our RPI so low we were nervous.”</p>\n<p>The sweep moved the Gauchos to 34-23 overall and into a tie for second place in the Big West Conference with Cal Poly at 17-10 in conference play. UC Davis fell to 19-37 and 5-22 in the Big West, finishing in last place this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In game one of the three game series on Thursday against the Aggies, the Gaucho offense exploded for 10 runs and 14 hits to defeat Davis 10-5. Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward had himself a day as he led the charge, going 4-4 with four runs batted in and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Senior third baseman Marc Venning and freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic each had a couple hits and had two RBI each in the 10 run outburst.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been hitting the ball real well the last couple of weeks in my opinion,” Venning said. “We had a lot of runners on base but we didn’t always score them but we just kept pounding away and eventually we ended up scoring some runs. We executed a lot better in the first two games which led to us putting up a bunch of runs.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone completed his final start of the regular season by throwing eight innings. He earned his ninth win as he allowed four runs and struck out four. Pettibone ends the regular season as the Big West Conference leader in innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Game two of the weekend series was another trouncing of the Aggies as the Gaucho offense continued to fire on all cylinders. UCSB scored eight runs on 15 hits in the 8-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Joey Epperson was the spark plug from the leadoff position, reaching base five times as he went 4-4 on the day with a hit by pitch, two doubles, an RBI, three runs scored and two stolen bases.</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa took advantage of the teams on base ability as they each drove in two runs.</p>\n<p>Woodward left game two with a knee injury and sat out of Saturday’s finale but should be able to play going forward.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Davis slowed down the Gaucho high flying offense but was unable to stop them from completing the three-game sweep. Sophomore Andrew Vasquez pitched just two and two thirds innings before being relieved by sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle, who earned his seventh win of the year with his five and a third shutout innings.</p>\n<p>Filling in for the injured Woodward, freshman second baseman Ryan Clark made sure there was nothing lost as he drove in three runs on Saturday, a career-high.</p>\n<p>After five innings, the two teams were tied 3-3, but Kuresa put the Gauchos on top with a solo home run, his fifth of the year, to give his team a lead that would be held by freshman pitcher Dylan Hecht‘s eighth and final save of the regular season.</p>\n<p>This will be the Gauchos’ first postseason since 2001. The postseason will begin on Friday, May 31, as UCSB will take on Texas A&amp;M in the Corvallis Regional, hosted by Oregon State.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 28, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51579\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51579\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/","id":4686,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4685,4684,4683],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pushing For The Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2632.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2632.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Heading into the season’s end, every game for the UCSB baseball team is incredibly important.

Cal Poly takes on a struggling Pacific team that was able to edge a win from UCSB last week, so if the Tigers can do the same this weekend, a sweep of Davis will set the Gauchos for a playoff chance.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will rely on the strength of their starting pitchers. In seven of the last nine games, UCSB starters have thrown quality starts, which is six innings of allowing just three earned runs or less. Tuesday’s starter, freshman Justin Jacome, just missed qualifying as he needed one more out. He still pitched five-and-two-thirds innings, allowing just two runs to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“Everything is going to stay the same,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We have had a lot of really good starts in a row going back with like six or seven quality starts in a row, so hopefully those guys continue to do that.”</p>\n<p>The weekend starters for the Gauchos have been stellar lately. Friday’s starter sophomore Austin Pettibone has thrown 17 innings over his last two starts and has allowed just two runs in that period.</p>\n<p>On the year, Pettibone sits with an 8-3 record and 3.00 ERA. He leads the Big West Conference with 102 innings pitched and is the only pitcher to have reached the 100 inning plateau so far this season.</p>\n<p>Through the struggles this season, Davis has had some players stand out this year. Sophomore designated hitter Nick Lynch ranks third in the Big West with a .361 batting average this season. Thanks to his high average and knack for getting hit by pitches, a Big West-high 20, Lynch is also third in the conference with an on-base percentage of .444.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outfielder Tino Lipson has scored the second-most runs for the Aggies with 30, thanks to his .340 batting average. Lipson also boasts an OBP of over .400. With runners aboard quite often, sophomore John Williams finds himself in very productive positions and ranks eighth in the Big West with his 38 RBI on the season.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Aggies have the highest batting average and the second-most runs scored in the Big West; however, the reason the team finds itself in the cellar of the conference is due to their inability to pitch effectively.</p>\n<p>The UC Davis pitching staff has given up the second-most hits, the second-most runs and allowed the most walks.
