This documentary has won 14 awards and has been screened worldwide. After the film ended there was a panel of five others to discuss the issues brought up during the screening. Those five panelists are: Cornelia Davis, Karen K. Myers, Maria Charles, Amr El Abbadi and Cynthia Stool (the moderator, so-to-speak).</p>\n<p>“Code” discusses women in S.T.E.M. — specifically women who are coders. The documentary sheds light on how women are brought up differently from men and are automatically deterred from S.T.E.M. Growing up, women are often told that they won’t like math, science or coding — or perhaps they are told that they aren’t good enough. When people are told something enough they start to believe it. The difference between men and women here is that men aren’t told that they aren’t good enough at math while women, generally, deal with that on a frequent basis.</p>\n<p>Reynolds interviewed several groups that promote women to engage in coding. Several of the groups focus on women of color or young children. According to “Code,” several countries have already made it mandatory to incorporate coding into the curriculum for children at a young age — while here, in the U.S., it isn’t even available at all schools. Availability of these types of courses greatly effect who can get into the field at a young age.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was interesting to find out how universal a skill like coding is. It is not just a tool strictly for S.T.E.M. majors — it can be used in artistic fields as well. One person interviewed in “Code,” Danielle Feinberg, expressed her love for both art and coding. Feinberg is a visual effects artist for Pixar; she showed how coding was used to animate Merida’s hair in the movie “Brave<em>.</em>” On top of animation, coding can be used for web design, video games, etc. The people interviewed all emphasized the need for more women in the field.</p>\n<p>Something that came up during the panelists’ discussion was the lack of availability of coding courses. There were a few professors and students in the audience from S.T.E.M. departments at UCSB that had a few words to say on this issue — including Professor Amr El Abbadi. The issue is that the class sizes for coding courses at UCSB are too small; they are filled up mostly by incoming freshmen, and primarily male ones at that. Several professors agree that women usually find interest after taking an intro course in the field once in college, but are unable to get into the major due to the lack of space. This created a large discussion in which no answers or possible solutions were found other than sustaining funding.</p>\n<p>A student brought up the fact that there are approximately 20 spots for new majors to transfer into the field after already having started college. Professor Amr El Abbadi expressed his frustration with the school assigning coding classes extremely small classrooms. He said that he can fit about 30-38 students in one room, but then there are another 30-38 students on the waitlist that cannot get in.</p>\n<p>Reynolds really made an eye-opening documentary. She even brought up the fact that it’s hard to get women to join the field especially when they become likely to be sexually harassed. She interviewed one women in particular who shared her story about being sexualized in the workplace. It got to the point where it was so bad that she left her job — and even then she was cyber-bullied/sexually harassed by her ex-co-workers.</p>\n<p>I barely scratched the surface of “Code: Debugging the Gender Gap<em>.</em>” One major issue the film covers is the issue of not having a diverse team. Not having a diverse team (i.e. just having men) can lead to accidents or certain issues getting overlooked. So if you ever have the opportunity to watch it, take it. It is really enlightening and educational. It sheds light on how important it is to diversify the coding institution and to include more women.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70964\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/debugging-the-gender-gap-with-code/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70964\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/debugging-the-gender-gap-with-code/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/debugging-the-gender-gap-with-code/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/debugging-the-gender-gap-with-code/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/debugging-the-gender-gap-with-code/","id":5875,"author":{"id":775,"name":"Taylor Sezen"},"related":[5874,5873,5872],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":775,"name":"Taylor Sezen","biography":"Not available","articles":[5873,5875,7985,7992,8051,7985,8051,7992],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Bare Necessities are All Here","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jungle-book-2016-posters-mowgli-baloo-e1461196787874.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jungle-book-2016-posters-mowgli-baloo-e1461196787874.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1","description":" If anything can be said about this film (the latest in Disney's pantheon of live-action remakes of their own animated classics), it's that it's probably the first live-action animated film.

Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a boy who lives in a world populated by talking animals. Raised by wolves, he must leave the pack when the ferocious tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) decides to eat him. Along his journey, Mowgli is escorted by his friend Bagheera the panther (Ben Kingsley) and the easy-going bear Baloo (Bill Murray).</p>\n<p>If you’re wondering why I even bothered explaining the plot to a remake, it’s because I am hoping that, like me, there are others out there who didn’t see the original Disney cartoon (runs for the hills).</p>\n<p>Seriously, though. If anything can be said about this film (the latest in Disney’s pantheon of live-action remakes of their own animated classics), it’s that it’s probably the first live-action animated film. Besides Mowgli, almost all of the characters in “The Jungle Book” have been constructed with computers. The same goes for, one can imagine, the vast majority of the environments. In a landscape where CGI has become a divisive aspect of the medium, if it’s not done right, it can cripple the viewer’s immersion.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Now that I’ve thoroughly teased the movie’s appearance, I will say that it, of course, looks absolutely astonishing. The jungle is colorful, vivid, bright and most certainly beautiful. But it pales in comparison to the animals. The last movie to make real-life creatures so convincing was “Life of Pi,” but here not only are there dozens more animals, but they talk.</p>\n<p>And, thankfully, these creatures do not dwell within the uncanny valley. Each animal is performed and animated to near-perfection. Bill Murray is rib-ticklingly funny as the big-hearted Baloo, providing some surprisingly grown-up jokes children are unlikely to understand. “That’s not a song, kid. That’s propaganda,” he tells Mowgli after he has finished reciting the code of the jungle. Sir Ben Kingsley gives Bagheera a certain majestic grace, yet he never overtakes his fellow actors while he’s on the screen.</p>\n<p>Idris Elba will probably haunt the dreams of the small children dragged to this movie as the genuinely menacing Shere Khan. And when he’s not snarling and providing jump-scares, he also taps into a fear that will strike at the hearts of adults; in one scene, he tells a cleverly metaphorical story to the pups of Raksha the wolf. As she calls to them to go to bed, Khan holds one back, subtly showing her the power he holds over her and the rest of the pack. “I think they like me,” he tells her once he lets the pup go. Golly, what a terrific villain (and, yes, I did just use golly).</p>\n<p>There is, however, a small problem with King Louie, which is probably the film’s only flaw. While he looks and sounds fine (Christopher Walken lends his stuttering tones to the massive ape) and remains relevant to the plot, he starts singing “I Wanna Be Like You” from the original “Jungle Book” movie. <em>This</em> movie is not a musical, so to have this character suddenly sing this song in what was initially a serious, straightforward film takes the sense of immersion and crushes it with a spiked boot. Then again, this is a movie about talking animals, so who am I to complain about immersion?</p>\n<p>When you get down to it, though, this is still a straightforward Disney film, plot tropes and all. Villains are bad, protagonists are good and the plot beats happen just how you think they would. This is absolutely not a bad thing, not in the slightest. If anything, it shows that the director is respectful toward the legacy of the original film. “The Jungle Book” is a labor of love, full of whimsy and wonderment, with amazing special effects and fun characters. Go see it if you need a good dose of childhood in your life.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung will return for “Captain America: Civil War”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70179\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/the-bare-necessities-are-all-here/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70179\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/the-bare-necessities-are-all-here/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/the-bare-necessities-are-all-here/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/the-bare-necessities-are-all-here/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/the-bare-necessities-are-all-here/","id":5872,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5871,5870,5869],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jaws Script-to-Screen Takes a Bite out of Pollock","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaws.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaws.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Gottlieb sat down for a Q&A session with Matthew Ryan, the director of Pollock Theater.

Their most recent event was the screening of “Jaws” and a Q&amp;A with one of the screenwriters, Carl Gottlieb. Whether you’ve seen “Jaws” before or not, it was breathtaking to see it once again on the big screen, this time in HD on Blu-ray!</p>\n<p>After the screening, Gottlieb sat down for a Q&amp;A session with Matthew Ryan, the director of Pollock Theater. Ryan asked Gottlieb several questions about the filming and recruitment process. Gottlieb gave some insight on how his personal experience was in dealing with “Jaws.” He had dropped everything in order to start the script for the film<em>. </em>Previously, Gottlieb had been working as a writer for a television series. When he got the job offer to work on “Jaws,” he quit his job, because writing for films was much more prestigious than writing for television.</p>\n<p>Gottlieb discussed the adaptation difficulties when writing the script for “Jaws.” It was difficult, he said, because in the original novel there were subplots dealing with the mayor and the mafia, Brody’s wife having an affair with Hooper and more. In order to get the film to what we know today, Gottlieb and others had to essentially prune the story to its basic structure. When the roles were cast, it became apparent that there was a different dynamic than the original story portrayed. For example, Brody’s wife would not be having an affair with Hooper in the film, because the actor was entirely different than the original character.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He told director Steven Spielberg, “I think we’re onto something here with this.”</p>\n<p>It was very much a communal effort to get this film to come to life. Of course, there was Spielberg as the director and Gottlieb as the writer, but everyone had to work together. There was a specific scene where Brody, Hooper and Quint were talking around the table aboard the Orca, and Quint gave a monologue. Gottlieb said that that was one of the more difficult scenes to get right. He and Spielberg passed the scene around to other writers to see if they could fix it up, but that didn’t help. It was Robert Shaw, Quint’s actor, who came up with the version that is seen in the final production of the film. Gottlieb said that he and Spielberg knew that that was the perfect version to use. According to Gottlieb, Shaw himself was a writer who “knows which end of the pencil is which.”</p>\n<p>Carl Gottlieb always made sure to give credit where credit was due, especially during the Q&amp;A. He mentioned how other writers tried to take credit for Shaw’s adaptation of the monologue, and some people even think he wrote it himself. Gottlieb apparently wishes he could take the credit for it, but that the monologue was all Shaw. There were other instances where Gottlieb would forget he wrote something and then would assume it was improvised. Brody’s line, “you’re gonna need a bigger boat,” is an example of that.</p>\n<p>After an hour of Q&amp;A, Matthew Ryan dismissed everyone to go enjoy snacks in the lobby. The snacks were somewhat “Jaws” themed: shark gummies and “the snack that smiles back” were two clever choices. Gottlieb could be seen wandering around the lobby, mingling with fans and UCSB students. The Carsey-Wolf center will be having more Script to Screen events in the future, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for them!</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Way to kick off Phase three, guys.</p>\n<p>What they did is nothing short of remarkable: They managed to make a film that, character-wise, is even larger in scale than “The Avengers,” and it works. There are more heroes, more motivations and more stories to tell than ever before, yet it never feels overstuffed or forced. “Civil War” puts Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in opposite ideological seats and sets them against each other. Each man comes up with valid points to back up their arguments, giving them motivation and lending actual believability to why they are fighting each other. Too bad it ended when Iron Man found out he and Cap’s mothers have the same name (I apologize to those who have heard that joke already ad nauseam).</p>\n<p>These two leading men predominantly take up the screen, but they also share it with oh so many welcome returns, the highlights being the wry Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who drops some dead-on one-liners on the members of Team Iron Man. Some character development is hinted at with Vision (Paul Bettany), ripe for growth in further sequels. Scarlett Witch also gets a really good mini-arc, but Elizabeth Olson apparently couldn’t decide between an American or Russian accent. When these guys all throw down, it’s absolutely glorious. It also speaks to the strength of the writing by showing that, despite their conflict, the Avengers don’t suddenly all hate each other. They’re still friends with different ideas, and you know what? That’s usually why friends fight. Bravo to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Also on the character front, some welcome fresh blood gets added to the mix. Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther couldn’t have been brought into the fold better, even if he had debuted in his own solo origin film (which is coming in 2018). Developed, badass and quick-witted, he’s an awesome new addition to the lineup. Same for Tom Holland’s Spider-Man (whose solo arrives 2017). Unlike Maguire and Garfield, Holland actually feels like a high-schooler. That’s not just because the actor is younger; he has actual concerns and personality traits beholden to a teen. And he’s fun! Spider-Man is fun again! And funny too! Boy, way to stick it to Sony. And to Joss Whedon, showing how not to overdo it on the quips.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the villain, Zemo. Although I am still a little confused about how he managed to do what he did, in retrospect (five hours post screening, to be precise), I am particularly impressed with the character. Unlike previous Marvel big bads, he’s not a dark mirror of the protagonist or a warlord commanding vast armies. Defying expectations even for the characters, he’s just a normal, albeit clever man out for sweet revenge. Yet he is able to set the Avengers against each other and have them dance in the palm of his hand. Hope Loki’s taking notes.</p>\n<p>As much as I would prefer not to do this, I have to directly compare <em>“</em>Civil War<em>” </em>to “Age of Ultron” here for a moment. A major reason why “Age of Ultron,” while not a complete failure, was a disappointment in the fact that it felt completely bereft of character development (stupid shoehorned romances aside). At no point was I convinced to give a shit about what was happening to the Avengers. I found myself much more invested in the personal conflicts of “Civil War,” which besides still being a frenetic and fun action romp tells a really good story about strained friendships. There’s actual heart here. So Russos? Markus? McFeely? Thank you. Don’t fuck up the “Infinity Wars.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/","id":5874,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5873,5872,5871],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
