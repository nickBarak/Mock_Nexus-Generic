Fellowship Program and changing the dynamic of the senate through the implementation of i&gt;clickers in the voting process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said IVP is “kind of a silent, behind-the-scenes job” because the primary functions of the position are to run senate meetings, maintain the internal functions of the association and work on its own projects.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She is most proud of her work to expand the A.S. Fellowship, which allows students to become fellows to A.S. senators and executives and learn about the inner workings of the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, 100 students applied to be fellows and 66 were chosen. She added that many fellows are running for A.S. positions in this election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is what I wanted it to be,” Jordan said. “I wanted it to be somewhere people could actually learn about the internal functions of the association before diving into a role.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her campaign for IVP, Jordan stressed her interest in working with freshmen to increase their engagement with A.S. While she does not know how to gauge the effectiveness of her efforts, Jordan said she tabled in residence halls and reached out to freshmen in the Summer Start Program and during Week of Welcome. She hopes the work she did encouraged freshmen to join A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her time as IVP, Jordan was charged with leading senate meetings, which at times could become disorderly when senators disagreed on issues or when controversial topics were discussed at public forum.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In November, the senate moved its meeting into Corwin Pavilion from its normal Flying A Room in the UCen as it planned to vote on a resolution that would allow conservative orator Ben Shapiro to speak on campus. The meeting lasted six hours, and the senate voted to approve the resolution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, she was able to maintain a stable climate during the meeting because she established agreements and rules everyone had to adhere to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also said while public forums can cause tensions to run high and extend senate meetings, she thinks it is “really beautiful” when so many students come to voice their concerns to the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The biggest part about that is when someone comes to talk to the senators, I think as an exec or as a senator, people forget that these people are taking time out of their day-to-day schedules to come and speak,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Whatever they’re talking about is a part of their reality, so in a situation where a senate meeting goes for six hours, it’s not something people can see as something bad, but in reality more students are engaged in the issues,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nushi Yapabandara, a third-year philosophy major, ran against Jordan for IVP in the A.S. election last spring. She said she “commends” Jordan for the way she has handled the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara said she hopes next year’s IVP is “able to maintain the level of strictness and discipline and respect that Natalie has … made a standard in senate meetings.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said many unexpected projects arose during her term that were not on her campaign platform, including the creation of an A.S. orientation program, which acts as a guide to those first introduced to the association, as well as the projects that fellows in the fellowship program took on themselves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She was most excited about the designation of an A.S. liaison from Counseling and Psychological Services to be available with students who work within A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, A.S. is a “lifestyle” and students make choices and sacrifices based on their involvement in the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of students, because of how taxing it can be, were experiencing a lot of mental health stresses,” Jordan said. “And I can totally understand that; I’ve been there.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said the designated liaison has done group sessions with the senate, attends senate meetings and has been involved in the current elections by checking in with the candidates’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also reflected on the projects she hoped to do but was unable to complete, including bringing food trucks in the Arbor during finals week and using i&gt;clickers during senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, university administrations halted the plan for food trucks. She said when she realized her i&gt;clicker plan would not work, she altered the goal to eventually attain a more permanent space for senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVP said that at the beginning of her term, she was “so bad at delegating,” which posed a learning curve for her as she settled into IVP.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’m kind of a controlling person and I want things to go my way … because I think sometimes I understand the greater picture, and it’s very naive of me to think that and I realize that,” Jordan said. “Sometimes I realize that instead of controlling a situation, it’s better to let others take a shot at it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara, who worked as Jordan’s director of programming during Fall Quarter, said she recognized Jordan’s struggle to give other staff members tasks as she “gunned through” and tried to do everything herself.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Yapabandara, this hindered Jordan’s ability to complete all the projects she wanted to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like she could have been a lot more transparent and accessible to everyone,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said that after her time as IVP, she has realized that the position is “experiential learning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No matter how much preparation you’ve had before or experience with this community, there’s really no way to learn how to manage an association of over 800 students overnight,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, the next elected IVP needs to focus on preserving a stable environment at senate meetings. She attributes her ability to handle the senate to the fact that she was an independent executive and “never had to play any games with anyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the next IVP needs to make sure they’re maintaining an unbiased viewpoint and also [make] sure that they’re really checking in with everyone and maintaining a really positive climate,” Jordan said. “You can only do so much, but trying at least matters.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As her time as IVP comes to an end and A.S. election season is almost over, Jordan said she loved the chance to be a “change-maker” in the association and now understands more about herself and her capabilities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sleep is way overrated,” Jordan said. “Four hours a night is the slumber of champions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said after her term is complete, she will continue her position as vice president of the Isla Vista Community Service District as well as her full-time job as the senior event coordinator at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/","id":3955,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3954,3953,3952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: EVPLA Ashcon Minoiefar","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-29-at-9.53.18-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-29-at-9.53.18-AM.png?resize=714%2C599&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

Its purpose was to serve as an alternative to what Schunk called “over-policing.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A.S. Public Safety Commission (ASPSC) later took charge of UCIV, and the program only operated during Deltopia and Halloween in the years to follow. When Minoiefar entered the office, he intended to work alongside ASPSC to make the program a weekly operation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Expansion of the program had a “slower start,” he said, because ASPSC relied mostly on their hired staff. They later found more success when they were able to “build more of a volunteer pool.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he assisted ASPSC in marketing for volunteers, suggesting to the UCIV organizers that they open the opportunity for different student groups to “sponsor a weekend.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One student group that did this recently, Minoiefar said, was Campus Democrats, which provided “a bunch of volunteers” for the weekend they sponsored.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[UCIV] is headed in the right direction, and I’m really happy to know that it’s going to stay here after I leave,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another goal for Minoiefar was to implement a policy of medical amnesty, which would protect UCSB students from legal charges if they are hospitalized while committing unlawful activities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar had been working with A.S. President Austin Hechler for over a year to regulate medical amnesty. Hechler said they came up with the idea after the university held a fraternity chapter liable for an unconscious partygoer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the problem exists outside this specific incident as well, saying students in residence halls and other groups, like sports teams, are often afraid to call 911 during parties.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Medical amnesty is state law, but it is not currently part of university policy. Minoiefar and Hechler have, for the past year, been drafting a new campus regulation called “the responsible action protocol.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said the draft passed a UCSB Campus Regulation committee “at the very beginning of this quarter,” and it now awaits approval by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar will soon be meeting with officials from UCSB Judicial Affairs to discuss implementation of the responsible action protocol, which he said is “really, really important.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’ve seen it work with student groups a lot … Students know that they can call [911] and be safe,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar also set out this year to decrease police presence at Deltopia, I.V.’s annual Spring Break celebration along Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Both UCPD and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) sent fewer police officers to Isla Vista this Deltopia, anticipating smaller crowds than in years prior. UCPD deployed approximately 70 officers for Deltopia this year, down from approximately 100 in 2016. SBSO did not want to disclose the number of officers it assigned.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Attendance increased to approximately 8,000 people this year, up from approximately 3,500 in 2016. Police made 42 different arrests this year, which is slightly more than last year but significantly lower than the number of arrests made the previous year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There were a total of 14 medical transports this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think Deltopia was a good enough of an event,” Minoiefar said. “I really wish that the [number of] medical transports could have been a lot lower. That, for me, is a benchmark of a successful day: making sure people are safe.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said several factors played into the decreased police presence at Deltopia this year. For one, he said police have “caught on” to public perceptions of having law enforcement at the event. He said having Spring Insight on the same weekend also helped.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“[Deltopia] being on Spring Insight kinda helped because the school wanted a good image there and was obviously concerned with how parents see this campus,” he said. “I wish we would have gotten on that train a little faster.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he sees Deltopia 2016 as a “measuring point” for what police presence during Deltopia could look like in future years.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would argue that I think it was a manageable day,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar said he came into the EVPLA “pretty aware of what it’s like,” having for years prior been involved in I.V.’s political scene.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I guess one thing that kind of surprised me was the degree of the kind of power that student leadership has,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The EVPLA really can establish himself as a mobilizer of student interests and a representative of student interests,” he said. “They are really heeded and looked to for a lot of answers, which was very … enlightening.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In his year serving in the position, Minoiefar said he has grown to be more of a delegator in his leadership style, whereas he said he used to be “kind of a micromanager.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristen Armellini, Minoiefar’s deputy chief of staff, said she has also saw this growth in Minoiefar, especially when it came to sending representatives to meetings on his behalf.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was going to meetings for him, and he really wanted to make sure I knew the position through and through,” she said. “He would let me go to meetings for him [and] would make sure we were educated on everything.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Madison Hechler, the EVPLA chief of staff, said Minoiefar teaching her was “an opportunity for him to share his passion for Isla Vista” and not a “chore.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Minoiefar plans to receive his degree in history of public policy in June. He will be starting an internship with the San Francisco District Attorney’s office, which he said is along the line of work that he hopes to go into.</p>\n<p>“I’ve really taken interest in law,” he said. “Public safety has always been a big part of what I do. I’ve always been keen on public service, and being a district attorney seems like a very engaging experience.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-evpla-ashcon-minoiefar/","id":3956,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3955,3954,3953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: Student Advocate General Josephine Ampaw","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-02-at-12.25.09-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-05-02-at-12.25.09-AM.png?resize=736%2C639&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

One year later, she reflects on her time in office.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) acts as a nonpartisan voice for students in the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA).

She said despite being “tough” and “blunt,” her emotional involvement in many issues guided her in the advocacy for students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“When I was running, my goal was to be the person that listened, and I actually feel like I did that,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Ampaw communicated with other students who did not always share her</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was definitely forced to shut up a lot, [and] I was forced to listen,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Ampaw, her biggest accomplishment was “opening the space” of the S.A.G. to women of color.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As the first black woman in the position, I didn’t realize how big of an impact that would be and how I would be able to be a strong voice for those communities and the diaspora,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I know I could have been a much stronger voice, and I would say that’s one of my biggest regrets, but I feel like I was able to pave a way,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When running for the position, Ampaw’s platform included increasing student awareness of the A.S. budget and creating a counselor in OSA for students accused of plagiarism.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said while she was unable to push A.S. budget transparency as much as she had wanted, she did improve the visibility of OSA finances.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Students have been able to come to me and ask me what I am doing with my money, and I am able to tell them very transparently and honestly,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her plan to create a counselor for students accused of plagiarism was ultimately carried out by the Office of Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said prior to starting her term as S.A.G., she thought she would be “fighting alone” on behalf of students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I thought it was going to be me against A.S.,” Ampaw said. “Sometimes it was definitely me versus A.S. … but in a lot of moments, I realized that my staff had my back.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw’s staff included Catt Phan, her deputy chief of staff and a third-year global studies major. Phan said she loved working with Ampaw because she “never [lost] humor and resilience and compassion.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I have had a lot of faith in Josephine,” Phan said, “not only as a person but as someone who is in an exec position for the student government. Josephine just wants to serve the students.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Phan, the large OSA staff was “a lot to handle,” and it was oftentimes difficult to get the entire staff together for meetings. Phan said, however, the OSA office is “very sensitive” due to the types of student cases it addresses, and believes Ampaw was an experienced and qualified person to serve as S.A.G.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she has personally changed throughout her term as S.A.G., having become more of an introvert and now finding less solace being with other people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I used to find so much rest from being around other people, but since being in this office, I find so much peace in being alone,” Ampaw said. “I thought I’d be a lot better being around other people.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her term as S.A.G. has inspired her to become a social worker in the future. Additionally, after she graduates, Ampaw will travel to Colorado for a fellowship with AmeriCorps where she will help students who struggled in traditional school with their public speaking skills.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Looking toward next year, Ampaw said the next elected S.A.G. cannot be swayed by partisanship and must stay true to the nonpartisan nature of the office.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I also expect this person to have goals and to have aspirations for this office and really be able to express those to the entire association and entire campus,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she is “really grateful” for the opportunity to have served as S.A.G. and wants to remind current A.S. candidates they hold an important place on campus.</p>\n<p>“For the people who are running, I would just want to say to them that the work is hard, but the work is totally worth it in the end,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/","id":3957,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3956,3955,3954],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
