Nevertheless, the two 19-year-olds have collaborated and delivered the five-track EP, <em>Crush. </em>On <em>Crush, </em>Lenae and Lacy, on the cusp of adulthood, come together to deliver an unorthodox yet soulful EP filled with a desire to remember past lovers and to feel wanted.</p>\n<p>Despite being young, the phenomenal duo have each had their fair share of experiences in the music industry. Lacy, a star from the band The Internet has ingrained his funky, tight beats into the ears of Kendrick Lamar listeners with his production on the inimitable track, “LUST” from Lamar’s <em>DAMN</em>. When he is not busy making beats on his iPhone, Lacy can also be heard accompanying artists such as Tyler, The Creator or Goldink, laying out some passionate vocals on songs like “911/Mr. Lonely” or “Some Girl.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lenae has released two EPs prior to <em>Crush</em>. On each she takes similar approaches to some funky instrumentals as she does on her project with Lacy. Her dreamy voice shines on her collaboration with Mick Jenkins, the bouncy, club-like banger “Communicate.” Lenae has also made appearances on albums like <em>blkswn</em> by Smino and <em>Telefone</em> by Noname in which she complements her peers to create passionate lyricism. But each of these seem to pale in comparison to the alliance which is Lenae and Lacy.</p>\n<p>Lenae’s voice is versatile as we receive what sounds like an attempt to escape the boundaries of her own vocal capacities. Her shrill singing on the EP single and opening track, “Sticky,” is reminiscent of the way Frank Ocean experiments with high pitched vocals on songs like “Ivy” or “Pretty Sweet” off of <em>Blonde</em>. Nonetheless, this is where Lenae finds power in testing the limitation of her vocal prowess. She gives Erykah Badu-esque vocals as she induces a dreamlike environment for her listeners when singing, “Slipping ‘til you let me drown; Hate me then you love me now.”</p>\n<p>Not a single moment does Lacy allow us to forget about his psychedelic guitar. On “Closer (Ode 2 U)” the groovy producer makes his presence known through consistently sexy instrumentation. Toward the back end of the track, the lush bass transcends Lenae into a falsetto over Lacy’s faint voice singing “Baby pull me closer, you should let me love you.” With “Computer Luv,” Lacy proves that he can provide a backdrop for Lenae with not only decorative guitar patterns but also through vocal elements as he accompanies her on the song’s hook.</p>\n<p>But really, where the two stand out is with their ability to make use of simplistic instrumentals. This is where Lacy finds success most: in his combination of seemingly effortless but unique guitar chords and synths. Like in his aforementioned standout production on Kendrick Lamar’s “LUST,” Lacy gives a repetitive, unconventional guitar riff on “4 Leaf Clover.” However, this is arguably the standout track of the five-song project. The R&amp;B singers bounce off of one another in synchronization to create a pretty, elegant blend. The duet combines to share their fear of commitment, uncertainty and taking the next step in a relationship.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, <em>Crush</em> is a modern take on old school R&amp;B. Each song is perfect for laying back, plugging in your headphones and lighting a candle to embrace the sensuality that Lenae and Lacy provide. It is clear that the young duo rely heavily on their predecessors. In <em>Crush</em>, Lacy and Lenae travel together through lingering compositions, unraveling one another’s potential as musicians. When asked about his opinion on the collaboration, Lacy looked at it as his “Pharrell/Kelis” or “Timbaland/Aaliyah” moment. Although the two have not quite reached such a level, the young virtuosos have created a more than exceptional collection of sensational, romantic ballads.</p><div

seven, I realized something was wrong with me. The unfaithful ending to my parents’ marriage as a result of my cheating father disintegrated my perception of my favorite human and what semblance I had of a nuclear family. At the time I couldn’t process all of this, and I didn’t know how to feel or what I was feeling. I was sad, I felt empty, I felt alone, I felt misguided, I felt angry. My mother had to take up two jobs to keep us afloat, and with no guidance on what to do with my emotions, I ate. I gained more weight, and I grew sadder as my confidence plummeted and my perception of myself was low. By age eight, I had come to terms that whatever fate lay ahead wasn’t going to be better than what I was living through. But my sister stopped me from committing suicide. I don’t know at what point things started to get better, but I do remember at the same time there was Bob.</p>\n<p>The sweet drums that began every song woke me up each morning, and the next thing I heard was the sweet voice and redeeming lyrics of reggae legend Bob Marley. After discovering his discography in the rom-com “50 First Dates,” I was hooked. His lyrics about the struggle of love, freedom, redemption, peace and life filled the emptiness I felt. Simultaneously, life was improving. I began to do soccer and lose the weight that had crippled my happiness, and I got to see my mom more.</p>\n<p>However, the feelings of emptiness and sadness still haunted the back of my head. That’s when I discovered System of a Down in the fifth grade. I can remember the first time I heard “Lonely Day.” It struck me to my roots; a counter to Bob’s positive rhythms, it helped soothe the anger and sadness that I did not understand. After this, I began to look more into the lyrics of other System of a Down songs and learned about things like the Prison Industrial Complex, Armenian Genocide, drug addiction, Tiananmen Square and American global militarization. I began to question the significance of my issues and began to focus on the struggles that communities across the world face.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As I grow older, I have begun to unpack the emotions I’ve suppressed and grown with, and how it has made me who I am. I continue to deal with my depression, but music continues to put melodies and words to emotions that I cannot. It continuously shows me that I’m not alone and helps me put a skip to my step on the mornings when I don’t want get up.</p>\n<p>–– Ivan Gonzalez</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most common form of music celebrated in America today is recorded music played from a phone or laptop. Recorded music is a valuable tool that can guide you out of one mindset and into another. Some songs are so intimate that they have the ability to validate your emotions with their lyricism. Songs that echo your emotions can be an incredible source of comfort in times of distress. Both a good friend and I each have our own Spotify playlists following the theme “comfort music.” These playlists are filled with songs from artists like Keaton Henson, The Smiths, Daughter, Chad VanGaalen and Sufjan Stevens. For an old friend of mine, listening to Sufjan Stevens was the only way to guide him out of a panic attack.</p>\n<p>An incredibly unifying form of music is live music. Live music not only has the power to bring groups of otherwise incompatible people together, but it also possesses the ability make people dance. Dancing is a way to find peace of mind; when moving my body in synchronicity to music I find it hard to have a stream of thoughts. To dance is to be expressionistic and aerobic at once, blending athleticism and artistry. I once attended a House Music concert and danced for nearly eight hours straight, completely absorbed in the beat, sound and the moment. I believe it’s really important for people to find time to silence their mind and be present with their bodies and live music provides an excellent opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>Creating music, though, has to be my favorite way to find either calmness or expression. I feel in this way you can really feel the energy of the music flowing through you. Writing a song allows me to transpose my own emotions into a set of chords or a melody. If I am feeling especially expressive, I might add lyrics to fit the song. I find that I am able to express myself more completely in song than I would be able to on paper or in conversation. Articulating how I’m feeling in such an engaging way is incredibly healing.</p>\n<p>Creating music with other people is also so important when it comes to mental wellness. Entering an intimate space with a group of other people, even strangers, is unifying. Harmonizing with other people, especially in singing, has always been an absolutely connecting dynamic for me. In times of loneliness and despondency, a person or group of people that can harmonize together can be incredibly uplifting. Music in its many forms provides a gateway to mental wellness. A reason why music can make you feel good is partially because of the way it resonates with you — both physically in the form of sound waves and mentally in terms of melody, chord progression and lyricism. Sound waves themselves are incredibly healing agents which, when used with the right skill, can bring people out of moments of incredible emotional trauma.</p>\n<p>–– Melody Pezeshkian</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One notable part of my childhood was the fact that it was literally accompanied by constant background music. My parents’ massive CD collection, which took up an entire wall of shelves in my house, was taken advantage of to the fullest –– our house was never silent except during the depths of the late night and early morning. Hours of subconscious listening to great musical geniuses from Miles Davis to Beethoven to Brian Eno created the template that shaped my childhood and cemented music into my very existence.</p>\n<p>This subconscious appreciation and gravitation toward music as a necessity rather than an embellishment offered itself as a revitalizing force when my personal struggles with anxiety peaked and pummeled me to the ground. Whether by offering analog nostalgia –– or rather the grounding sense of relatability –– music was, above all, a consistency. A consistency in times where I was drowning in sea of inconsistency. Regardless of where I was, what I was doing or how I was feeling, I could always turn to the euphoria and consolation that music provided me.</p>\n<p>Having a very broad taste in music, it is interesting to look back on playlists and albums that I wore out during times of significant personal mental-health struggles. Songs varied from sappy Frank Sinatra love songs to the most aggressive tunes that Death Grips has to offer. In these difficult periods of my life, my subconscious gravitated toward music that I could (even if entirely unknowingly) relate to. As the styles and artists that I indulged in changed, one thing stayed the same: I never stopped listening to music.</p>\n<p>Music is the most reliable, most adaptable and possibly most entertaining companion to have when dealing with mental health problems. Although others may not have the same childhood experience as me, music is a universal force that shapes many people’s lives. In times where stress, anxiety or depression are controlling you in every sense, music can be the light at the end of the tunnel, an element of consistency and the companion that always appeals to what you truly need the most.</p>\n<p>–– Sonya Sherman</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I am a person who hides things. All my life, especially throughout high school and the beginning of college, I have always hidden things from my friends, parents and, to some extent, also from myself. It took me about three years to admit to myself that I was not okay in the normal sense, and when my C.A.P.S. counselor told me I had depression, I wasn’t shocked in the slightest.</p>\n<p>The same day I had my first C.A.P.S. appointment, I bought Spotify premium. I didn’t plan this; it was just something that happened. I had been using regular Spotify for a while, and the ad interruptions just weren’t cutting it for me anymore. I started making playlists and, like almost everyone else, I created one playlist full of sad songs. I called this playlist “Happy Music” because sharing emotions still wasn’t my forte. As I added more music to this playlist, it slowly became a soundtrack to my feelings. This soundtrack was the only way I felt comfortable externalizing the inner goings of my mind.</p>\n<p>In denying my depression from myself, I had never let myself be sad. I couldn’t allow myself to feel down on the weekends because those were the days I volunteered. Forget Mondays and Thursdays from 9-12; that was when I had dance practice. In this fashion, I gave myself very limited time periods during which I let myself stop hiding my emotions. It was at these times that I listened to my “Happy Music” playlist. The music let me just sit with myself and take a deep breath. Yeah, it’s cliché, but it was when I was listening to music that I wasn’t forcing myself to put up a façade to the outside world.</p>\n<p>Music didn’t help me by making me happier all of a sudden; music helped me take the first step in letting myself accept that I was depressed. I still have depression. The numb feeling that I’ve associated with almost everything hasn’t disappeared. However, I’ve taught myself that it’s okay to listen to my “Happy Music” playlist between classes, when I’m doing homework or just working out. Music brought my out of hiding and taught me that my depression isn’t who I am, but it is currently a part of me, and that’s okay.</p>\n<p>–– Anushna Patel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anxiety. It’s the toughest feeling to pinpoint and gives the most bizarre sensations throughout my body, whether that be pains in my head or shortness of my breath. For years, I have set out to discover personal temporary cures to my anxiety, and one of the most crucial, consistently useful tools is music. Music possesses a power like no other, brandishing the ability to influence our heart and breathing rates. As the perfect tool to combat anxiety, it’s unbelievably reassuring that putting my earphones on and listening to music can soothe unwanted anxious feelings.</p>\n<p>Years ago, I experienced a panic attack so severe that I was positive I was going to die. Despite the shortness of breath and heart palpitations, I decided to sit on the couch, take deep breaths and turn on the TV to distract myself. Thankfully, I somehow came across a channel playing bits of Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac and James Taylor concerts. Enveloping my attention in the tranquil, simplistic beauty of these songs immediately soothed my anxious thoughts, compelling me to understand life’s underlying simplicity and the sense that everyone else possesses uncertainties in their lives, just as I do.</p>\n<p>Certain artists such as The National, Billy Joel, The Smiths and Van Morrison hold immense power in helping me pinpoint the core of my anxious feelings considering that at times, I feel as if they’re writing songs about my life instead of theirs. I personally believe that it’s insanely important for people (especially those suffering from anxiety) to identify the artists that move them and influence their emotions in a way that makes them feel less alone. My anxiety always fades away when I realize that I’m not alone in feeling the way I do, and what better way is there to feel this way than to simply listen to music?</p>\n<p>–– Sam Sakamoto</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Music has helped me live for at least the past ten years. It’s a medium that’s unique in its promise of total privacy; when you’re walking alone with headphones in, there is no one in the world who knows what’s in your mind. This escape saved my life as a kid, as a teenager and as a young adult  more times than I can count.</p>\n<p>When I was little, five or six, I would bury my face in the pillow upon waking and mash my closed eyes into the fabric, seeing which shapes I could make. I don’t do this anymore, but I listen to music. It is very much a pillow. It has a way of making the pit inside you seem scalable, realer and therefore less scary. It helps the <em>you</em> part feel real, too. Stronger. More there<em>.</em></p>\n<p>I’ve struggled with depression on and off since I was 12. Depression — it’s part of a conversation now and more accepted than ever before. But it wasn’t back then. Depression had nothing to do with neglect and serotonin and cycles and medicine, but it did have everything to do with Thom Yorke moaning, “I’m not here / This isn’t happening.” When you have nothing to hold onto, the voice in your ear becomes your world. Everything after that was colored by the strange richness I felt knowing that someone else shared that feeling of dissociation. I felt the words and sounds inside my brain: they were mine. I carried them into the day.</p>\n<p>A couple months ago, during spring break, I went to a U.S. Girls concert in San Francisco. It was at a tiny club — Rickshaw Stop. By the time Meg Remy took the stage, it was packed. For over an hour, she wove a stratosphere of feeling. The place was purple with love. I don’t know how she did it, and I don’t remember every song. What I do remember is the final 10-minute jam, when she kneeled at the edge of the stage and put her hand out into the void, looking at everyone at once, saying, “I love you. I care about you. I love you.”</p>\n<p>–– Andre Bouyssounouse</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

abundance of glimmering lights and filled by a majority of middle-aged fans, the Santa Barbara Bowl was blessed with an outrageously effervescent performance by LCD Soundsystem. Despite likely having outgrown the post-punk sound that influenced the early releases of LCD Soundsystem’s music, those in attendance did not fail to immerse themselves in the show.</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, the legendary, genre-bending group made a stop at the SB Bowl to put on a life-altering performance. LCD Soundsystem proved to continue maintaining a legacy which has earned itself a victory lap once it comes to a gut-wrenching end.</p>\n<p>Prior to LCD Soundsystem gracing the stage, electronic duo Poolside kept the rhythm up for the few in attendance during the event’s beginning moments. A large disco ball hovered graciously above the stage, which suited the performance — Poolside labels their music as “Daytime Disco.” But as the sun began to set and the clock on the edge of the stage ticked, the audience became more and more anxious for LCD Soundsystem’s appearance. The groovy ballads could not contain the excitement lingering through everyone waiting.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lights dimmed and frontman James Murphy approached the mic, accompanied by his seven bandmates, and thus, the mayhem commenced. As he stood there intensely, clad in messy scruff, unkempt hair, suit jacket and all, bodies swarmed and Murphy prepared to make the stadium his playhouse.</p>\n<p>The band prepped the audience with an opening performance of “Yr City’s A Sucker,” a song which on the surface could pass as a track that is too downtempo to be an opener. LCD Soundsystem proved otherwise. And they continued to do so with each song, progressively captivating those in attendance more and more.</p>\n<p>“Get your drinks from the beer garden and get the hell over here!” Murphy yelled at the crowd testing them as if to see whether or not they were up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>Throughout the show, each song was more enticing than the last. The grandeur of their discography is remarkable as is, yet they managed to elevate each song to completely new levels by putting on phenomenal live rhythms. With a career that has endured since 2002, the years can reflect in one of two ways: the time can take a toll or their experience makes their performance even more efficient. Luckily, the latter seems to be the case. Murphy is relentless in his delivery, and with the support of immaculate instrumentals, his voice is carried swiftly through crowds. The impact of his vocals vibrated the audience and the slick guitar riffs intertwined with jam-packed drums to induce a head-bobbing atmosphere which resonated throughout the venue.</p>\n<p>The presentation of LCD Soundsystem’s live display was mesmerizing. With each thump from the drums and each wave from the synth, a different colored light shot from the massive hovering disco ball out into the crowd and all over the trees. The backdrop was dreamlike, switching from a sheet of red to galactic patterns, both outlining Murphy’s silhouette perfectly. Coupled with ultra-danceable instrumentation, the beams of light created a fascinating atmosphere, overlaying the crowd’s lively, spirited fist pumps.</p>\n<p>Up until a brief pause between two of their songs, nothing interrupted their elegant transition from track to track. This break was only made in order for Murphy to inform the crowd that the band would stop for a bathroom break very soon. “Don’t worry we’ll come back,” he said. “No need for all the encore chants.”</p>\n<p>Aside from this, the only other time that their seamlessly pinpointed performance paused was for Murphy to announce the rest of the members’ names. He went through in an orderly fashion, naming off Tyler Pope, Pat Mahoney, Nancy Whang, Korey Richey, Matt Thornley, Gavin Rayna Russom and Al Doyle.</p>\n<p>Shiny lights glistened as Murphy’s powerful voice sorrowfully begged in deep cut “I Can Change” off of <em>This Is Happening.</em> The crowd burst as Murphy bellowed, “We won’t be your babies anymore / We won’t be your babies ’til you take us home” during “You Wanted A Hit,” and they welcomed electrifying guitar riffs. In these moments, I could not help but realize how overlooked Murphy’s vocals are.</p>\n<p>LCD Soundsystem played a number of songs, flipping through the plethora of hits which they have created. The band tapped into some of the new contemporary highlights from their catalog such as “I Used To” and “Tonite” from <em>American Dream</em>, in which Murphy’s voice continued to pierce through the bodies that stood in amazement. “Get Innocuous!” from <em>Sound Of Silver </em>was a standout moment. The live interpretation of this song was enthralling as Whang chanted, “You can normalize. Don’t it make you feel alive?” and lights flashed on and off. When the stadium turned black for almost a split second, one could feel the intensity of the crowd’s desire for more.</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, LCD Soundsystem had proven that my expectations paled in comparison to what was to come. A wonderful setting with incredible music was the perfect combination. At the SB Bowl, the stakes weren’t high for an audience filled with fans, but Murphy remained consistent and demonstrated the mastery which deems LCD Soundsystem as a legendary band — proving that they can probably do this forever.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83046\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83046\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/","id":6644,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6643,6642,6641],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Pride Month Bangers","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-06-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rainbow-149485_640.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rainbow-149485_640.png?resize=640%2C320&ssl=1","description":"Musicians and artists have always been at the forefront of social change, and a recent wave of confident queer artists have helped usher in a new era of Pride Month jams.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, June. The beautiful summer month in which corporate logos begin their annual wardrobe change from monochrome mundaneness to rainbow realness. While in recent years corporations have welcomed Pride Month and inclusion with open arms, Pride marches and movements stem from a history of struggle, as queer people battled for representation and acceptance in all arenas of life. While many battles may appear to be definitively won, recent moves by the current presidential administration to stifle LGBTQ+ rights signal the ever-growing importance of Pride Month and LGBTQ+ representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how many rainbow scarves Tony the Tiger wears, the spirit of inclusion, self-acceptance and equality that Pride represents will remain important. Musicians and artists have always been at the forefront of social change, and a recent wave of confident queer artists have helped usher in a new era of Pride Month jams. In honor of the month of the Gays, below is a definitive list of new and old Pride Month Bangers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. “Bloom”- Troye Sivan</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Troye Sivan, the sweet prince of pop, has been delivering danceable summer jams since his early days as a teen Youtuber. His 2015 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighbourhood </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gave us his first exploration of queer identity as a coming-to-age and coming out album, in which he explored the struggles of discovering and shaping one’s identity. However, “Bloom,” the title track off his upcoming album, finds a much more confident and self-assured Sivan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bright pop song follows Sivan into a field of flower fueled metaphors, allusions and innuendos as he tackles the previously unexplored and unmentionable topic of gay sex. His sweet melodies and smooth voice take listeners on an intimate yet euphoric journey on a topic which has previously been ushered into the shadows. A music video, which matches the bright, colorful vibe of the track, explores both Sivan’s masculinity and femininity and questions the lines drawn between the two. The song and video shine the vibrant hues of Pride by turning a fun dance track into a vehicle for representation.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41PTANtZFW0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “Pynk (feat. Grimes)” – Janelle Monae</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monae, a multifaceted talent, has been nominated for Grammys, has appeared in Oscar-winning films and has been deemed a fashion icon. Her decision to come out as openly pansexual this year on her album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirty Computer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allows her to add “LGBTQ+ Icon” to that impressive list. Monae’s confident attitude and charismatic charm endows each track of the album with energy. However, “Pynk”’s artful celebration of the female existence seems especially important after Monae’s recent powerful statement of truth. Monae, a protégé of the purple man, Prince, finds her own color by imbuing pink as the color of feminine sexuality, power and desire. The romantic song manages to sound both upbeat and tender as Monae expresses desire and appreciation for women. Monae’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics create a playful dimension to this feminine, queer anthem. The song’s video, which features Monae and backup dancers dressed in what can only be described as “vagina pants,” perfectly accompanies the song’s sweet, funky vibes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PaYvlVR_BEc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Supermodel” – RuPaul</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before RuPaul had “Drag Race” glued to his last name and an entire empire, he was simply America’s most famous drag queen. Oh, yeah, and a bigtime recording artist. “Supermodel,” one of the most-fun songs ever to be recorded, imbues joy into the ears of anyone who hears its banging beat. As RuPaul commands his listeners to, “Work it, covergirl,” “Give us a twirl” and “Do your thing on the runway,” his listeners actually transform into runway models, equipped with fierce poses and sickening faces. After listening to this song maybe 500 times this month, the Hadids better watch out because this writer is ready for his Vogue debut. The song preaches the same self-acceptance and confidence which the ever popular reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” evokes in its viewers, allowing Supermodel to be a Pride Month dancefloor staple. This irresistible track captures the energy, confidence and love Pride pushes forward.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vw9LOrHU8JI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>4. “Chanel” – Frank Ocean</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Way back in 2012, Frank Ocean became the first openly-gay major hip hop artist after he released his landmark album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Channel Orange</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While Ocean’s dreamy, velvety vocals launched him into musical stardom, his idiosyncratic lyrics have pushed him among contemporary legends. On “Chanel,” a single from 2017, Ocean is in top form, delivering verse after verse that challenges and questions societal norms of gender, sexuality and success. Ocean’s lines flow and build upon each other, creating layers of meaning culminating in heart-wrenching croons. Ocean “sees both sides like Chanel,” and can “see on both sides like Chanel,” referencing both the fashion brand’s crossed “C” logo and his appreciation for his lover’s feminine and masculine sides. The quality of art delivered by Ocean makes him the queer icon we need and deserve. Chanel gives us an opportunity to appreciate all of Ocean’s talents, and that’s something we can all be proud of.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnbsIl2BnWw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>5. “I Don’t Want It at All” – Kim Petras</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Petras’ sugary-pop sound can only be described as a lollipop covered completely in Fun Dip. On her breakthrough single, “I Don’t Want It at All</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Petras is at maximum exuberance demanding — not asking — for all her wants and needs to be answered. If not delivered with Petras’ signature sweet and fun charisma, the song could sound flat and shallow. But with Petras in the driver’s seat, the song steers into the lane of colorful pop perfection. Petras first launched into international awareness as a young German teen fighting the German government for the right to receive sex reassignment surgery. After becoming the youngest person to ever undergo the surgery, Petras began writing songs and pursuing her dream of pop stardom. Petras’ mastery of pop signals that being trans and a popstar are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, her talent, charm and ambition proves her place in the future of pop and as a prominent figure of Pride.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC9FA8lZRy8</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83617\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83617\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/","id":6645,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6644,6643,6642],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
