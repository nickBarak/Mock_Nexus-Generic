He began his career in law enforcement in the Bay Area, later transferring to Inglewood and becoming a police chief for Moscow, Idaho, where he oversaw the city and the University of Idaho. He was also the chief of police for the City of Lompoc in 1995.</li>\n<li>Lt. Hsueh has worked in SBSO for 31 years. He’s led initiatives to provide officers trainings on responding to people with mental illness and trained over 700 officers in two years. Hsueh said he wants to improve training to teach officers to use less force and implement more crisis de-escalation training.</li>\n<li>Lt. Olmstead has worked in SBSO for 28 years and has worked in every division in the department, including the narcotics and human trafficking units.

Eddie Hsueh and Lt. Brian Olmstead discuss police-resident relations and sexual assault policies in Isla Vista. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Responding to Cases of Sexual Assault in I.V.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said officers should treat survivors with dignity and compassion, as if they were members of their own family. The department does not have a single rape kit that has not been processed, Brown said.</li>\n<li>Hsueh said SBSO could benefit from referring victims to both Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, formerly the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, and UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education, as well as implementing green dot and implicit bias training. Green dot training teaches people to be an active bystander in preventing sexual assault.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said he believes law enforcement could provide more education to the public about where victims can report sexual assault cases, as jurisdictional issues can be confusing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Police-Resident Relations During Large Events in I.V. </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said future large events in I.V. such as Deltopia should only be for local community members because the majority of crime and citations during these events are linked to people from out of town.</li>\n<li>Hsueh suggested SBSO work with the CSD to create sanctioned events that minimize crime through crisis stabilization units and through triaging those suffering from alcohol and drug abuse. Hsueh has been on the “front lines” of riots and said police often did not act in accordance with their training because they did not give ample notice before using their weapons.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said more alcohol-free daytime events could decrease the rates of crime and medical transports because alcohol is a main source of problems during I.V. events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All three candidates unanimously expressed support for medical amnesty for overdose victims and those suffering from alcohol and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Hsueh, in particular, expressed support for written policies that would show the public that the department’s emphasis is to protect their lives. Under these new policies, those seeking medical attention for illegal activities like drug use or underage drinking would not be arrested.</p>\n<p><strong>Candidates’ Perspective on I.C.E. Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown, who has previously complied with I.C.E.’s requests, said he would continue to comply with requests to give the agency the release dates of violent criminals.</li>\n<li>Hsueh was the only of three candidates to state that he would stop complying with I.C.E.’s orders, which he said was necessary to improve “public trust.”</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the immigration system currently needs “comprehensive reform” but said the department needs to follow the law and focus on removing violent people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concerns Over SBSO Lack of Personnel</strong></p>\n<p>The three candidates said one of the department’s pressing needs is its lack of personnel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said the department has lost approximately 90 positions funded through the county’s general fund since 2008. He said the department has cut programs in non-emergency areas and lost several specialized units and crime prevention programs, but he hopes to bring back those programs incrementally.</li>\n<li>Hsueh agreed with Brown’s position.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the county has paid $4.5 million in overtime as a result of vacancies. He said SBSO currently needs to fill 50 funded positions, including approximately 30 sworn officers. He said the department currently lacks a recruitment plan for completing the new hirings.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83342\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83342\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/","id":3756,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3755,3754,3753],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How Much Are SB County Sheriff Candidates Spending for Your Vote?","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-27-at-5.37.16-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-27-at-5.37.16-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sheriff Bill Brown leads the fundraising effort comfortably with $251,364, as of May 25 — the last date on file that Brown reported finances — ahead of Lt.
