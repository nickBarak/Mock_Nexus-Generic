Though highly anticipated, the artist’s set provoked polarizing responses from attendees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ScHoolboy kicked off his performance with the track “Gangsta” from his 2014 LP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oxymoron</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The crowd collectively jumped in relief after a suspenseful intermission as Q infiltrated the stage. Midway through the track, ScHoolboy reached his microphone out toward the crowd, seemingly under the impression that the audience would recite lyrics back to him. </span></p>\n<p>Despite the artist’s expectations, the crowd didn’t reciprocate, and instead, ScHoolboy suffered an awkward lapse of silence. Q was visibly dissatisfied with this outcome, judging by the swift rate at which his facial expression and body movement fell flat. After closing the track out, the rapper expressed his feelings about UCSB’s presence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“UC Santa Barbara, what the fuck is up right now?” he exclaimed. “So look, I’mma let the record reflect right now, I done did mad college shows. And this is by far, one song already in, this is already the most boringest college show I done all year.” It isn’t too often that an audience gets directly confronted about being boring, and the gesture certainly invoked the crowd’s attention.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The startled audience reacted to ScHoolboy’s anecdote with more energy, but, a quiet crowd does somewhat make sense. ScHoolboy Q is popular, but not necessarily a household name like his TDE counterpart Kendrick Lamar, for example. Most attendees didn’t know every lyric and detail of his music, and the event had elapsed for north of five hours prior to his set. Hence, a fatigued crowd is understandable, and an audience that lacks familiarity with the event’s headliner isn’t catastrophic. So, is ScHoolboy’s response justified? </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78109\" style=\"width: 1375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1913049339\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78143\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78109\" data-attachment-id=\"78109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3354-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3354\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78109\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1332\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought ScHoolboy Q was good because he tried to get us [the crowd] more involved when he saw that our involvement wasn’t at the level it could have been.” Carlos Ruvalcaba, a first-year Communication major on Q’s performance. Although some may have found ScHoolboy’s demeanor to be insulting, there are positive aspects at hand. </span></p>\n<p>His approach surely energized the crowd, at least to a degree. And at the end of the show the rapper expressed a change in opinion. Wrapping up the set, ScHoolboy gestured to the crowd and revised his previous position. “Yo, actually it wasn’t the worst college show I done, I done way worse than this. This shit was kind of fun.”</p>\n<p>His compliment, if one could call it that, was back-handed–but this is who ScHoolboy Q is. His behavior isn’t out of character, and it certainly plays into the persona that has been crafted over the artist’s career. That is, ScHoolboy Q portrays himself as gritty, intoxicated, and carefree. Perhaps the negative response he garnered derives from unfamiliarity with his persona, or maybe the artist is genuinely blunt to the extent at which it diminished the experience for those who attended the show.</p>\n<p>In any event, ScHoolboy Q’s polarizing performance, accompanied by a breadth of student reactions inarguably made for a provocative act at Extravaganza. To some, his set was a source of dissatisfaction; though, considering ScHoolboy’s words, these feelings may be mutual.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gorillaz, the critically acclaimed virtual rock band and brainchild of musician Damon Albarn and comic artist Jamie Hewlett, released their fifth studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The band consists of virtual members 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle and Russel Hobbs. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the first Gorillaz album released since 2010, and it seemed to be on the right track with five solid promotional singles. However, the full project generally failed to live up the high expectations that long-time fans have for Gorillaz.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 20-song album (26 if you get the deluxe version) certainly delivers a high quantity of tracks that Gorillaz fans have been desperate for over the past few years, but at times, it feels bloated and disjointed as an album. It starts with a magnificent intro that sets up the themes of post-apocalyptic technology, which permeates the album and smoothly transitions to perhaps the most exciting song on the album, “Ascension.” Featuring stellar verses by Vince Staples over a manic beat, this starts the album with a punch to the face in the best way possible. However, the next track, “Strobelite,” leaves much to be desired. While the song itself isn’t bad, it sounds like an incredibly generic house track featuring singer Peven Everett. There is almost no trace of Gorillaz in this song, and this is only the second real song of the album. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, “Strobelite” is indicative of the album as a whole, as many of the songs feel like frontman Albarn’s excuse to produce tracks for his favorite artists. This would be fine if this was one of Albarn’s solo projects, but Gorillaz carries with it an expectation to play into the unique aspect of a virtual band with an interesting cast of characters — a feature sorely lacking on most of the tracks here.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is a plethora of missteps and questionable decisions on this album (don’t even get me started on the bizarre and boring “Hallelujah Money” or SoundCloud quality “Sex Murder Party”), there are also quite a few highlights. “Charger” actually sounds like a true Gorillaz track and has a nasty driving guitar groove that adds a lot of grit to the track. The Grace Jones feature is one of the few features on the album that doesn’t completely dominate the track, as she contributes otherworldly ad-libs that compliment 2-D’s vocals. The middle of the album proves to be the best section and, not coincidently, is the section that feels less overpowering — including the only featureless song on the album, “Busted and Blue.” The melancholy, space-themed ballad brings a moment of genuine emotion in a largely overproduced tracklist and actually brings that fantasy of a virtual band with fictional characters that makes Gorillaz so special. A highlight in the last half of the album is “She’s My Collar,” with the stunning vocals of Kali Uchis brings energy and steadies the album a bit after the rocky “Sex Murder Party.” Other tracks to check out include “Andromeda,” which brings a similar house style as “Strobelite” but maintains the Gorillaz flavor and “We Got the Power,” the catchy, though a bit simple, closer to the album.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz  </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turned out to be an overall disappointment compared to the band’s previous work. It is very hard to come back after seven years and still maintain the consistency that fans have come to expect from Gorillaz throughout their career. However, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">definitely has some highlights that recapture the magic that made the band’s previous work so engaging with fans. Fans expect a Gorillaz album to play into the idea of the virtual band, and this album did not have that level of immersion that previous projects did. One can sense the lack of creative impact Hewlett had on the album. Going forward, if they release another album under the Gorillaz moniker, they should play into the unique aspect of the band that fans love. You should give this album a listen, especially the highlight tracks, but don’t expect the grand return of Gorillaz. For that, we just might have to wait some more.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77847\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77847\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/","id":6684,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6683,6682,6681],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Extravaganza ’17 Rocks the Masses","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite insistent cries from the audience, Schoolboy left the Extravaganza stage as he had found it, with no want for enthusiasm.

The singer thanked UCSB profusely over an ocean of anxious noise before beginning with a rendition of her Schoolboy collab, “2 On.”</p>\n<p>SB was easily enthralled by the pop star’s performance. The force of her stage presence introduced an energy unlike anything UCSB’s concert scene has provided in the past year: the playful, in-your-face excitement of pop-diva stardom. All of her typical hits, including “Superlove,” “Flame” and “Company,” as well as songs off her 2016 studio album, <em>Nightride</em>, made appearances in Tinashe’s set. Longtime fans found no disappointment, while those unfamiliar with her work found enthusiasm in the vivacity of her act.</p>\n<p>Through her performance, Tinashe best connected with the crowd in a moment toward the end of her set. The line between the scheduled songs and the encore had blurred beyond haze-filled recognition, while the blaring brightness and scorch of the day drowned the better part of the crowd’s concentration. Tinashe finally paused. The singer visibly caught her breath as she addressed the crowd with “a special song, one close to my heart,” a song meant for all those who “understand why I’m here.” Channeling the anticipation felt in waiting on a lover, the performer had the crowd transfixed at the song’s opening line.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78107\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1361077705\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78107\" data-attachment-id=\"78107\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_2599/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_2599\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78107\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78107\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Tinashe at last completed her marathon, finishing her final song with a noticeable pant.

With one last blown kiss, the once ecstatic stadium reverted to its strange liminal state of void noise.</p>\n<p>Tasked with picking up the quieted slack, Michigan-born electronica artist GRiZ snuck onstage to surprise the growing mass of college students. Reminiscent of RL Grime’s intensity, GRiZ’s set was much better suited for the outdoor air of UCSB’s signature nonchalant attitude. He recaptured the enthusiasm of the somewhat fizzled concert, becoming a stunning success from relative obscurity. GRiZ opened his set with some festive, chill swells. However, he quickly ascended into liveliness, invigorating Extravaganza with jazzy beats.</p>\n<p>GRiZ was accompanied onstage by his brass-playing companion, a trumpeter recalling the funky live sets of Big Gigantic. The Michigan performer himself wielded an impressive tenor sax. Yet the two musicians’ onstage vivacity was subdued by the striking quality of GRiZ’s visuals: a series of abstract animations reported to be of the artist’s own production. Images included a silhouetted head opening to release swirling streamers of color. Many were amazed by the unexpected detail of the set and the passionate simplicity of GRiZ’s performance. The duo brought an infusion of authentic excitement to a genre so unfamiliar with live instrumental performance.</p>\n<p>“The trumpet was <em>really</em> good,” screamed bubbly first-year Marissa Erese, “probably my favorite part.”</p>\n<p>GRiZ’s set offered some original work as well as mixes of well-received pop culture classics. The EDM artist raised Harder with a brass-infused performance of The Isley Brothers’ “Shout.” The chant of the song’s iconic lyrics resounded even when GRiZ turned the chorus momentarily off.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78108\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1767386801\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78108\" data-attachment-id=\"78108\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3035-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3035\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78108\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78108\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Again, the rush of sound and energy followed the performer off the stage. The babble of the crowd returned as concertgoers staked their claim on the floor or saddled for the arduous voyage to Harder’s rear in search of water. A stream of dead-eyed Extravaganzees could be seen clutching complementary water bottles as they queued at the cluster of administrative tents.</p>\n<p>Back onstage, in the heated haze of the festival’s waning hours, an enthusiastic, not entirely out-of-place twentysomething strode to the stage’s front.</p>\n<p>“Y’all need more energy before I can let Schoolboy come out here,” he taunted, priming the Extravaganza crowd for their headliner.</p>\n<p>Schoolboy Q entered Isla Vista with much anticipation. Sizing up the crowd with his characteristically smirky grin, Q yelled Extravaganza to life. Accusations of UCSB’s lacking level of energy prompted a fanatic series of screams from his audience.</p>\n<p>Extravaganza was only realized at the sound of the jingling opening of “Collard Greens.” The crowd chanted unanimously alongside the heavily panting rapper as a chasm of mosh enveloped the field’s center. Schoolboy ran through the list of his classic hits including “Studio” and “Break the Bank,” carried by the weight of his status as rap kingpin. The characteristic sharpness of his post-gangsta rap, South Central attitude shone in the casual nature of his crowd-mocking. Though rarely melodic, with discombobulated verses and a heavy dependence on freestyle, Schoolboy managed to provide a cohesive performance. The rapper’s set played well to Extravaganza’s atmosphere (contrary to the performer’s original beliefs), a release of scholastic pressure for a Sunday afternoon rush of music, raging and sweaty bodies. However, Schoolboy did incite some of his back-home, Flog-Gnaw rawness with the enormous mosh pit that slowly developed in the center of the field.</p>\n<p>Q paused to taunt the crowd, demanding everyone unready for part two of his performance, “Go back to your dorm rooms.” The rapper took his challenge a step further by denigrating the supposed lack of UCSB energy. “They were better at UCSD,” smirked the rapper. This served only to reinvigorate the crowd through chants of <em>olé, olé, olé, olé</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78109\" style=\"width: 1375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1140110231\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78109\" data-attachment-id=\"78109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3354-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3354\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78109\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1332\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Schoolboy finished with a performance of Kendrick’s “M.A.A.D.

Succumbing to the chants of “one more song,” Schoolboy riled the crowd with an improvised rendition of his most anticipated song, “THat Part.” Despite insistent cries from the audience, Schoolboy left the Extravaganza stage as he had found it, with no want for enthusiasm. The mass of concertgoers slid to the exits with the Santa Barbara sunset materializing over their exhausted heads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/","id":6685,"author":{"id":699,"name":"Daniel Gitlin"},"related":[6684,6683,6682],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Smino to Bring Soulful Sounds to the Hub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Smino-Graphic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Smino-Graphic.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The rapper’s words rebound off the bouncing melodies of each track in a way that keeps the album’s sonic momentum moving at a steady yet nonchalant pace.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>St. Louis rapper Smino is slated to perform in the Hub at UCSB on Thursday, Jan. 25 at 8 p.m. The artist has spent the past year touring with artists like T-Pain and Top Dawg Entertainment’s SZA in the wake of the release of his debut album, <em>blkswn.</em></p>\n<p>Over the years, the Hub has been host to numerous live outings at UCSB.

Smino has garnered attention from a handful of his contemporaries, even securing collaborations with artists such as Noname and Bari. At age 14, Smino met Bari, a local Missouri rapper, after it was suggested that the two collaborate together.

American DJ Sango, who, like Booker, belongs to the Soulection record label, is also credited with production on numerous Smino projects.</p>\n<p><em>Blkswn </em>opens up with a smooth, sensual cut, “Wild Irish Roses,” which sets a warm tone for following tracks. Smino’s vocal performances and verses marry perfectly with Monte Booker’s production over the record. The rapper’s words rebound off the bouncing melodies of each track in a way that keeps the album’s sonic momentum moving at a steady yet nonchalant pace. “Glass Flows” has a flowery vocal feature from Ravyn Lenae that sounds entirely akin to its title: glassy and flowy. Some of my favorite tracks are found later on <em>blkswn</em>. “Netflix &amp; Dusse” and “Father Son, Holy Smoke” showcase some of Smino’s best lyrical and tactical abilities.</p>\n<p>Smino’s true musical prowess is exhibited on tracks like “Kolors,” which was featured on Soulection’s White Label record. On the track, the rapper weaves in and out of a variety of tones and volumes as he depicts a scene of himself dancing with a girl who was just heartbroken by a significant other, leaving her nestled within a mosaic of different feelings.</p>\n<p>Smino’s character is elevating. The artist is keen on promoting his community as well as the black community around the world, often speaking publicly about his experiences as a black man. His politics are progressive; he dismantles common conservative notions of gender and race in his music and interviews. On Real Late with Peter Rosenberg, the artist commented on derogatory figures in music who spread messages that are oppressive to particular groups and how he and his contemporaries combat those sentiments. “There are just a bunch of kids that are non-judgemental, period… It’s not even about the music. We’re humans out here. Anything you’re talking about, it’s cool,” he said.</p>\n<p>It is of my opinion that Smino’s character and music mutually enhance the quality of each other. The Hub will likely provide the artist with an intimate space in which he can share his thoughtful, eccentric personality and craft with fans.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.
