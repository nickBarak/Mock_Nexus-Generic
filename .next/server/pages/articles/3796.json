Crimes occurring later in the week included an arrest for unlicensed marijuana possession and the usual distribution of citations for minors in possession of alcohol.</p>\n<p>According to Sergeant Rob Plastino, officers received a call early morning last Monday on March 24 from an individual reporting that a masked man went into his home and assaulted him with a machete. The suspect, Plastino said, was wearing a mask, hoodie and all black clothing.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was in his residence and while there, someone entered his house,” Plastino said. “The victim received a wound that was two inches deep and two inches long on his arm. It seems that he raised his arms to defend himself from the assailant’s attack.”</p>\n<p>The victim then fled to I.V. Food Coop where he contacted the police. Plastino said the victim was transported to the hospital shortly after, and now the incident is facing investigation.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call from a victim that stated his roommate punched him several times in the head. According to Plastino, deputies who arrived at the victim’s residence observed that he had “a large welt on the backside of his head,” although the man refused medical attention.</p>\n<p>“The suspect states that the victim was being disrespectful because he was having sex with his [the suspect’s] girlfriend in front of him,” Plastino said. “Because the victim wanted to press charges, the suspect was arrested and booked into jail.”</p>\n<p>Also on Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call that there was a large in-progress fight outside 6776 Del Playa Drive. When officers arrived, most of the crowd scattered except for one individual, whom deputies approached.</p>\n<p>“The suspect was found to be drunk in public and while being arrested, he started a fight with deputies and kicked a police sergeant several times,” Plastino said. “He was booked with multiple charges, including public intoxication and assault on a police officer.”</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies on patrol near Del Playa and Camino Majorca contacted four people sitting inside a car, smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol. According to Plastino, when an officer approached the vehicle and the driver rolled down the window, marijuana smoke emanated from the car.</p>\n<p>“The suspect had no marijuana license and the deputies determined that the passengers consisted of a 19-year-old male driver, a 23-year-old male sitting in the passenger seat and two 15-year-old females sitting in the back seat,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino stated that the 23-year old male was cited for multiple charges, including providing alcohol to minors. The 19-year-old male was cited with minor in possession of alcohol as well as other charges.</p>\n<p>“The two juvenile girls initially lied about their identity when contacted. Being fifteen, they had no driver licenses, but officers eventually discovered who they were … they are being charged with minor in possession and false representation.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, a victim called 9-11 reporting that a 40-year-old man threw a rock at him, but missed.</p>\n<p>“When officers arrived at the scene, the suspect threw the rock behind a building where it could not be located,” Plastino said. “However, when officers made contact with the suspect, they discovered he was in possession of a stolen bike and a cell phone that was not his. He was arrested for assault and the possession of stolen property.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Wednesday, April 2, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54554\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54554\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/","id":3796,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3795,3794,3793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang","biography":"Not available","articles":[227,3070,3785,3787,3788,3790,3793,3796,3798,3799,3819],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up (5-2 to 5-5 2014)","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to the discovery of a dead female body on the beach as well as an occurrence of shoplifting, among other minor incidents.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to the discovery of a dead female body on the beach as well as an occurrence of shoplifting, among other minor incidents.</p>\n<p>According IVFP Station Lieutenant Robert Plastino, deputies responded following a call by a cyclist at approximately 7:00 a.m. on Sunday to report a female body lying on the beach. Police and fire officials determined that the female was deceased and later identified the female as second-year junior and double major in language, culture and society and philosophy Sierra Markee-Winkler.</p>\n<p>Plastino said police were able to determine the body as Markee-Winkler due to help from her roommate and forensic evidence.</p>\n<p>“During an area canvas, IVFP was approached by a female subject, who observed us carrying the decedent from the beach and was concerned that it may have been her missing roommate,” Plastino said. “Using forensics and a lead provided by [Winkler’s] roommate, the decedent’s identity was verified.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said investigation into the circumstances surrounding Markee-Winkler’s death are ongoing and that although a cause of death has not yet been determined, Markee-Winkler was missing the night before.</p>\n<p>“Preliminary investigation revealed that Markee-Winkler was involved in an argument with one of her roommates at her residence,” Plastino said. “Markee-Winkler, who had been drinking and was upset, left the residence and headed toward the 6800 block of Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>However, Plastino said that while Markee-Winkler was reported to be emotional when she left the scene, there was no sign of foul play and no one had followed her.</p>\n<p>“[The] Sheriff’s, Coroner’s and forensic team are working to determine the cause of death,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Until a full autopsy is completed, Plastino said, there are several possible causes of death, including a fall from the cliff. But Plastino said it is likely Markee-Winkler died from other causes due to her experience living in I.V. and the fact that her phone and sandals were found neatly placed behind the residence located at 6865 Del Playa.</p>\n<p>“Initially, we were thinking she accidentally fell off, but then we realized this is not the typical fall from the cliff. Unlike other victims, who are usually out-of-towners or [freshmen], she was a junior and knew the area well,” Plastino said. “But there is nothing to indicate that she threw herself off on purpose.”</p>\n<p>Plastino also said it was possible Markee-Winkler had gone down to the beach and fallen asleep on the sand when the waves were at low tide and was later unable to escape the high tide currents.</p>\n<p>“Remember, it is pitch black down there at night and the water is freezing. In that water, she wouldn’t have lasted 15 minutes,” Plastino said. “We have a lot of questions that still need to be answered.”</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, deputies also responded to a call on Saturday afternoon at approximately 1:05 p.m. from the Movement Ink store on 6556 Pardall Road. The store’s owner had detained an individual suspected of shoplifting.</p>\n<p>“The owner of the store was standing inside the shop detaining [the suspect]. The shop owner signed a citizen’s arrest form and stated [the suspect] walked out of the store with a hat worth $40 concealed under his shirt,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The owner confronted the suspect outside, Plastino said, which is when the suspect revealed the hat. After performing a background check on the suspect, officers discovered he had committed other acts of theft in the past.</p>\n<p>“[The suspect] admitted to law enforcement that he hid the hat under his shirt,” Plastino said. “A record check showed [the suspect] had been arrested less than a month prior for shoplifting at 7-Eleven and was a person of interest in a residential burglary in 2013.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested and eventually released with a citation for theft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, May 7, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/","id":3793,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3792,3791,3790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Arrest Salinas Man on Rape Charges","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies arrested a man yesterday on charges of raping a 19-year-old female UCSB student.
