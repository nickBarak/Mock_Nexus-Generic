I hope you were all sufficiently sloshed on New Years. As I shamefully wasted an opportunity to make countless “Santa’s sack” jokes for the Christmas holiday, and instead chose to rant about tits, I feel I must take this opportunity to respectfully nod in the direction of the new year and, by default, resolutions.</p>\n<p>Obviously there is the standard of “lose weight,” and “eat right,” which we all know only last for the first week of January. Mine personally is to become a Renaissance woman (start beekeeping, own a motorcycle, have an appreciation for opera). But on top of our personal resolutions, let’s take a moment to make a resolution or two for our sex lives. There is always room for improvement! Without further adieu, I present to you your sexual resolutions for 2013 (*waves hand grandly in arc*).</p>\n<p>1. Have Sex:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>These are your college years; the years that you should be looking back on with a wince and excusing them with, “it was college.” When else can you be sexually inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” start rubbing your nipples and bang your incredibly bemused (yet utterly compliant) study partner? You would think never, but hey, as I said, that’s college for you. Don’t look back on your college days without anything wild and crazy to show for. Eventually your firm skin and taught bellies will degrade into soft decline (depending whether or not you make it past the first week of January). Better get it while it’s hot.</p>\n<p>2. Not With Your Ex:</p>\n<p>Come on. It’s a new year, new conquests! Christmas break is for what I like to call “The Great Purge.” No, this is not in reference to consuming mass quantities of food, becoming shamefully opulent and then attempting to rid thyself of all the late night feasting. By this I mean you have three weeks to submerge yourself in your friends and family, and all that is most important. During this time, you utterly ignore thoughts of any member of the opposite sex who has been getting your panties in a bunch. You may find, as I have, that a number of people who have been occupying your romantic sphere are tolerated rather than actually liked. So purge them out of your system and enjoy the other flavors.</p>\n<p>3. Be Kinkier:</p>\n<p>I am the fondest spokeswoman of this cause. What I love about kinky sex is that it takes sex and makes it new again. What happened to that breathless thrill, that burning feeling of sex being delightfully taboo? Due to its rampant nature in Isla Vista, often the act becomes the norm, the everyday, typical. Spontaneously nip their shoulder. Cover her mouth when she gets loud while simultaneously licking her ear. Tug on his hair. Order them around. Tie her up. See? Feeling the burn already.</p>\n<p>4. Don’t be afraid to ask:</p>\n<p>This, above all else, baffles me. Why would you not want to get what you want? By guiding them you are almost guaranteed your proper pleasure. And lord knows they appreciate it. Insert Helen Keller joke here. Many are afraid to say what they want because they don’t know want to ruin the moment. Depending on what appeals more to you, your options are as such: a) physical cues (put their hands where you want them and move them as you desire) b) turn your breathy moan into purring instruction or c) deliver a dominant command: if not properly carried out, punishment is in store.</p>\n<p>5. Get flexible:</p>\n<p>I was stretching at the gym today when it occurred to me: many people lack the ability to touch their toes. And if they can’t touch their toes, I’m going to follow the logical flow of progression in that they can’t put aforementioned toes behind their head. Which is a shame, as it is a personal favorite of mine. By lacking a limber body, you may be more limited in the things you can try. You might also suffer as I have and get awful sex cramps in a tight muscle. Fight the battle before it comes to your door. Weeping is generally a turn off.</p>\n<p>6. Do it in new fun places:</p>\n<p>Out of all places, I mean the library. I want to shag amongst the shelves of academia, toppling tomes in frenzied passion. You’d be lying if you said you hadn’t thought about it. Now, unfortunately, my fantasies always end in the shelves toppling over and resulting in the ultimate ruin of the sixth floor, but that’s just my thought process. There are boundless nooks and crannies to explore your companion’s nooks and crannies. In general, don’t limit yourself to the bed; it’s so… white bread. Take your Lusty Lewis on an expedition into the world of sexual locale (yes I am trying to turn Lewis and Clarke into a sexual metaphor. The break was too long). Fond examples of mine, proven to be delightful: the shower, the floor, the dresser, the kitchen island, the ledge next to my sink, the beach, in a parking structure… you understand. It imbues your actions with a restless sense of desperation; you must have them on the closest available surface at this very moment. Focusing specifically on shower sex, this is a unanimous favorite. Hot water pouring down your body, you’re both wet and instead of cuddling after you connect via loofa.</p>\n<p>7. Try new positions:</p>\n<p>Missionary is a safe, successful position, but please do not only use the missionary position. Other positions can boast better angles, sensations or visuals. Try something new. Just don’t be that guy who has to pull out every move to show he knows where the clitoris is.</p>\n<p>8. Learn where the clitoris is.</p>\n<p>9. Have sex with the lights on:</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to see the person you’ve gone home with, you shouldn’t be going home with them. Look at your shame. Besides, much of arousal comes from visual cues. Not getting to see all the little details like lip biting or eyes squeezed closed detracts from the experience.</p>\n<p>10. Demand your orgasms:</p>\n<p>For too long, women have dealt with not getting theirs. Just because women don’t shoot fireworks from their hoo-ha to let you know the deed has been done, doesn’t mean that you’re free to stop whenever. If we can breathe through our noses while resisting the urge to gag, in the name of reciprocity, we should at least get our fair share. I’ll admit, I’ll often just deal because I don’t want to turn the sexual experience into a tyrannical affair, but no longer! A solid way to ensure this is to enforce a strict “ladies first” policy.</p>\n<p>All right, there’s your list! Apply as one would a soothing balm to the wounds of your sexual past. Happy Humping and bang in the New Year right!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. often thinks about sex at the gym – she’s the one with her feet behind her head and a smirk on her face.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49247\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49247\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/","id":6381,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6380,6379,6378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E.","biography":"Not available","articles":[6320,6325,6328,6347,6349,6351,6353,6356,6359,6361,6363,6368,6371,6372,6374,6376,6377,6381,6408],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Definition of Virginity is Unqueer","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2018-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_3274.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_3274.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Anabel Costa challenges the heteronormative cultural parameters for intimacy.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to talk about sex, and growing up, virginity always seemed to take the spotlight. Sleepovers are riddled with questions like, “When will I lose my virginity?” or, “How did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lose your virginity?” These questions always plagued me, yet at the same time, they brought immense curiosity. As a queer woman, I have a lot of confusion and frustration with the word itself. Over time I’ve come to realize that virginity doesn’t even exist; by definition, it refers to the first time someone has sex, but sex can mean different things to different people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the occasions that I have found myself in a circle of friends, talking about virginity or how we lost it, more than one of the stories always seem to end with some statement like, “It went in and out like three times and then we were done.” Now, there is nothing wrong with this, and if both members felt like it was sex, then it was, because sex should be defined by the individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My issues with this only come in when queer women who have had sex with other women are considered virgins simply because they’ve never been penetrated. My girlfriend has been called a virgin by our friends because they don’t readily accept what we do as sex. So if my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.” Ultimately, sex is culturally defined by the presence of a penis, or at least some form of penetration, and this is just wrong.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

We often miss out on having those stories about our “first time,” because no one ever talks about what that would even look like. One of the things I heard about while I was growing up was “scissoring,” and I thought, “So, are we just supposed to smash our labia together until we both come in one simultaneous moment of bliss?” No, young Anabel, nobody does that. The next thing you might learn is that lesbians lose their virginity when they are eaten out. This sounds great, except men can eat out girls as well, so why are straight women who have only been eaten out still considered virgins?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s almost as if we’re agreeing that gay women really only get half the experience that straight women get, and as someone who has had sex with both men and women, that just doesn’t feel like the truth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what’s next? The strap-on. If you have just been fucked with a strap-on for the first time, most people would argue you have lost your virginity. But what about the person who wore it? I doubt that many people would consider that a loss of virginity for the giver. Truth be told, I don’t know how queer women lose their virginity with the cultural definition we currently hold, and that’s why the definition must change.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stated earlier that losing your virginity is defined by the first time a person has sex. This implies that in order to understand what that means, we must first decide what it means to have sex. My definition of sex is that it must be a consensual, intimate, vulnerable and, of course, sexual act. That’s it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my straight friends, after having sex for the first time, reported that they didn’t feel any different. I myself reported the same thing after having sex with a man. This is probably because we had already had milestone-like experiences that were consensual, intimate, vulnerable and sexual that did make us feel different or changed. At least, I know this is the case for myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can pinpoint a couple times when I actually felt like I lost my virginity that don’t match the classic definition. It wasn’t the first time I had sex with a man, or the first time a girl ate me out, or even the first time I was fucked with a strap-on. I would say I lost my virginity the first time my girlfriend saw me naked and I felt my most vulnerable — but also my most beautiful. I could also say it was the first time I gave my girlfriend an orgasm, even if it was only with my hands. I could even argue that with each new partner I am losing my virginity over and over again, because I am learning to be vulnerable with someone new — just like how every kiss with a new person feels like my first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your moment is, the point is that it doesn’t matter. Sex is whatever it feels like it should be to you and your partner. Plus, virginity is made up anyway, so who really cares?       </span></p>\n<p><em>Anabel Costa wants Gauchos to define their own intimate experiences as they see fit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Our instructors have excellent interpersonal skills. They like to wait a few minutes before officially starting a lecture: greeting students, oversharing or sitting in charming silence. I also certainly respect how our instructors have transitioned their lectures to be Zoom-friendly. No more iClicker questions. No more class readers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe in freedom of expression, allowing our students to demonstrate their individuality through their nicknames and chat room conversations. However, if a neighbor’s lawn mower roars, if your sister decides to blast reggae music or if your dog demonstrates their yearn for your attention through intense barking in the middle of a lecture, we expect you to mute yourself. Effective communication is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to turn on your camera, so the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawthorne effect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensures that you are not goofing off.

If you are a little bit shy or you have just woken up from a fat nap, or are in the process of diving back into a fat nap, nobody will be offended if you turn off your camera. But imagine your professor speaking to named black screens. Think of how lonely and awkward they must feel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We trust that you are capable of taking care of your own wellness.

I apologize in advance, dear readers, for the lack of witty one-liners.</p>\n<p>I tend to get irritated by the amount of labels that people put on each other; among them, “gay” and “straight” are pretty high up on the list, but the highest on the list? “Bisexual.” But not for the reason you think.</p>\n<p>Before we continue, let’s get something straight here (pun intended). I am not in any way trying to bash those who may identify with any of the labels that I am about to unleash a torrent of hate on. I am merely commenting on the absurdity of trying to place the inhabitants of this planet into a few (quite a few, actually) stringently defined categories.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the few things I know for certain after having lived my short 20 years on this planet is that nobody is definable; nobody fits into a category, and even if they did, the range of categories certainly wouldn’t consist solely of the three that people commonly associate today with sexuality. If we’re going to continue with our maniacal categorization of people, then we need to create a separate category for every single member of the human race.</p>\n<p>Much like every other aspect of human nature, sexuality can be fluid. At any one time somebody might find themselves on a different point on the sexual spectrum than when they checked the day before. Just as there are infinite decimal numbers between zero and one, there are infinite points on the sexual spectrum that can be felt by any one individual, and whatever point you find yourself resting on might not be the point your circumstances leave you standing on when your life ends.</p>\n<p>I never thought I’d find an example case in a modern hip-hop artist, but Frank Ocean’s coming out a few months ago yields a perfect one.</p>\n<p>NPR published an article on the importance of his letter, in which he details his romance with a man from his young adulthood. In his letter, addressed to the world, Ocean doesn’t label himself as gay or even as bisexual. He instead allows the nature of his sexuality to remain malleable and indefinable as far as the reader is concerned, and that’s exactly the way it should be. The NPR article states, in a way I find appropriately succinct:</p>\n<p>“Ocean’s [letter] presented sexuality as something that arises within particular circumstances, defined by shifting desire and individual encounters rather than solidifying as an identity.”</p>\n<p>So I guess the next time somebody asks me if I’m gay, I’ll just smile at them and tell them that the nature of my sexuality is in a constant state of flux and I resist the urge to label myself as anything definite. Or maybe I’ll just tell them I’m human. Or maybe I’ll just tell them it doesn’t matter because who I fall in love with or who I take to bed is not my whole identity; it is but a fleeting and indefinable aspect of everything that makes me who I am. So deal with it.</p>\n<p><em>Luc Gendrot: You can call him that if you like, but he prefers ‘human.’ It’s more accurate.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49837\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-30/some-fruit-just-shouldnt-be-labeled-why-you-cant-name-frame-or-slap-a-sticker-on-sexuality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49837\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-30/some-fruit-just-shouldnt-be-labeled-why-you-cant-name-frame-or-slap-a-sticker-on-sexuality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-30/some-fruit-just-shouldnt-be-labeled-why-you-cant-name-frame-or-slap-a-sticker-on-sexuality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-30/some-fruit-just-shouldnt-be-labeled-why-you-cant-name-frame-or-slap-a-sticker-on-sexuality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-30/some-fruit-just-shouldnt-be-labeled-why-you-cant-name-frame-or-slap-a-sticker-on-sexuality/","id":6380,"author":{"id":456,"name":"Luc Gendrot"},"related":[6379,6378,6377],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
