","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A few months ago, I got the Snapchat app. I was looking forward to being included in all my sorority sisters’ standard pictures of duck faces and froyo. But while I am constantly bombarded with those, I also started to receive something unexpected: A full on Snapchat terrorist attack. Getting a friend request from a random username (and here’s where mistakes were made), I figured I would simply add them; surely the snaps would lend to their identity, right? False. It instead led to two months of me receiving bizarre dick pics. The penis was always flaccid and noodly and, perhaps to lessen the blow, it was always framed in hearts, flowers and smiley faces. Due to my inexperience with the app, I was drastically unprepared: I had no idea how to delete people. And I kept forgetting his username, so I was always freshly bombarded when I opened the snaps. Finally, some kind soul showed me how to delete the heinous doodling flasher.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m all for a good naughty picture … given the right circumstances. So maybe I should outline what those circumstances are, for all of you prospective pic-senders:</p>\n<p>Rule #1: Pictures and sexts should always be consensual. An unwanted dick pic can ruin your day. My friend says she really appreciates it when a guy preludes a picture with, “Hey, can I send you a dirty picture?” rather than just doing it. That way you don’t embarrass yourself, and your recipient won’t be afraid to open messages from you.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rule #2: Save them for someone special. Personally, I wouldn’t trust a lot of guys with a naked picture of me. There’s no doubt in my mind that they’d want to show their buddies or do something douchey, like make it a contact picture. Heaven forbid they hold it over you if things go badly. I save my pictures for boyfriends or people I really trust. If you do decide to send one to your booty call, for the love of God, please leave out your face.</p>\n<p>Rule #3: Better to Snap it than to text it. Despite my own demons regarding Snapchat, it’s a much better medium for dirty pictures. There’s more security with the time limit (don’t forget about screenshots, though) and you can use the text bar and doodles to make it more fun. For instance, I know someone who takes snaps of his naked body in a mirror, but covers his penis with a heart. It still oils up my love machine, but in a funny, unthreatening way. Just like sex, I think that dick pics are better when they are lighthearted and fun.</p>\n<p>On a similar note, let’s address sexting. Just like naked photos, you need to assess your partner’s willingness to stimulate you with written word. Lead into it, showing them how attractive you find them and how hot and bothered you’re getting thinking about them. “Last night was great … Can’t stop thinking about all the sounds you made ;)” or “Can’t stop thinking about all the things I want to do to you.” Depending on their response — “Oh yeah saucy boy? Like what?”/ “By those sounds do you mean me groaning in disappointment?”) —  you’ll have an idea of whether or not they’re down.</p>\n<p>As aptly stated by a friend of mine, “sexting in locations where sex would be most inappropriate makes for the hottest sextual intercourse.” I can’t help but agree. Sexts are best when one party is in a professional environment or at a family function. Nudge danger with your inappropriately timed boner; it’ll add to the sexual thrill.</p>\n<p>After a buildup, you can go into full blown story mode, i.e., “And then once I pull your panties off with my teeth, I’ll…” That’s always a ton of fun. However, in my opinion, more enticing statements would be, “Thinking about your hot breath on my lap,” or, “Can’t stop thinking about my head pressed between your thighs as you squirm.” Just writing these gets me biting my lip. Tease me, get me all revved up, but don’t give me the satisfaction. That way I’ll be spun up when I finally do see you. Sex is better when you tease beforehand ­­— the same goes for sexting.</p>\n<p>Just like dick pics, sexts are better with creativity. For instance, here is a sexual haiku I received over text message:</p>\n<p><em>Erotic power.</em></p>\n<p><em>Balls slapping against pussy.</em></p>\n<p><em>Your moans drive my lust.</em></p>\n<p>I had the most sophisticated lady boner ever.  That 5-7-5 structure just does it for me.</p>\n<p>Finally, dear readers, I leave you with a challenge: If you have a naughty dick picture you’re considering sending, maybe you’ll take a trip over to <i>http://critiquemydickpic.tumblr.com</i> and culture it up. It’s an amusing website where the web hostess receives your dick pics and gives you an A-F rating, as well as a detailed evaluation. I challenge you to send in your dick pic. Let’s class it up. No more stereotypical ab/dick selfies with yellow lighting; let’s throw in some filters. Make that shit artsy. CONTRAST, YO.</p>\n<p>Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. appreciates when people go the extra mile to make their dick pics classy.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Farted. May or may not have been you.<br>\nYou’re the one who ate the jalapeno bean burrito during lunch. The sex, however, is a little too loud and rowdy for you to truly pinpoint the stink criminal, so instead, just let it go and try to cover up the smell with some major hip gyrating and louder moaning.</p>\n<p>2. Queefed. This one was definitely you.<br>\nNo escape here. It’s not like he has the squelching vagina.</p>\n<p>3. Forgot to shave.<br>\nThere’s nothing like a nice pair of prickly legs, spidery underarms and a spiky nether region to keep your partner aroused.</p>\n<p>4. Hair tie or die.<br>\nHe’s already sweating enough to cure California’s drought, and you’re only adding to the sweat pool. So here you are, wishing you brought a damn hair tie. Sure, post-sex bedhead is cute, but you can’t seem to remember why as your hair plasters to your neck like an itchy sticker.</p>\n<p>5. Salty boobs.<br>\nI’ve always been confounded about how I should respond when my boyfriend, upon affectionately licking my nipples after (or during) sex, exclaims: “Salty.” Thanks, I was sweating?</p>\n<p>6. Facial gone wrong.<br>\nEver had a badly aimed facial where cum landed directly in your eye? Bad, I tell you. Bad. My eye stayed irritated for a good couple of hours.</p>\n<p>7. Forgot you had a tampon in.<br>\nIt took some epic debating to finally decide that yes, sex during a period is fine … until you suddenly remember as he presses his tip against you that your tampon is still inside.</p>\n<p>8. Dried menstrual blood…<br>\n…is pretty darn scary in the a.m. It seemed like a harmless idea to do it in the blood the night before, but waking up to crusty redness all up in between your legs, on his penis, on your face and over his hands isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing morning view.</p>\n<p>9. Me no speak dirty?<br>\nBlanking out on dirty talk triggers feelings of moderate inadequacy and high awkwardness. In a desperate attempt to continue the sexual momentum, you splutter out phrases like “oh you bad boy” and “you like that?” and “fuck me” (in altering variations). The only problem is that the more you talk, the more you realize that you’re saying the same lines over and over again. If you feel the need to increase your vulgar vocabulary, I suggest visiting thesaurus.com or reading more erotic literature. “Talk dirty to me?” I’m trying, Jason Derulo. I’m trying.</p>\n<p>10. Weird cramp.<br>\nIt’s the sudden, painful contraction of the muscles in your calf, your buttock, the arch of your foot … What’s saddening is how quickly a cramp drains away your mood and sends you straight back to stage zero arousal.</p>\n<p>11. Boobs squeezed way too hard.<br>\nThese are orbs of flesh that you should respect and massage, not stress balls that you squeeze the living daylights out of.</p>\n<p>12. Butt slapped way too severely.<br>\nQuick stings feel hot and sexy, but these whams feel borderline sadistic. The uncomfortable part about this check item is how to tell your partner that his butt-slapping action turns you off more than on. The even more uncomfortable part is when he takes out some rope and replies, “Wait, I thought you were into BDSM?”</p>\n<p>13. Weird stains.<br>\nOn the underwear, on the bed sheets … Who knows what actually happened?</p>\n<p>14. Photo of parents stare back at you.<br>\nMaking love to a man who loves his ‘rents? That’s cute, but not during the moment you look over his shoulder and notice in horror that the family photo watches you ever so closely.</p>\n<p>15. Bfarting (belly farts).<br>\n[Noun of my own creation] Pronounced &lt;buh\\fart\\eeng&gt; (the ‘b’ is not silent.)<br>\n[Meaning] A bizarre sound produced when two sweaty bellies suction together. The noise is fart-equivalent.</p>\n<p>16. He ejaculates inside. The awkward cleanup process.<br>\nTo the women who have a handy trick on how to deal with the semen deposited inside of them, please share your wisdom. For the rest of us, it’s a “1-2-3 GO, GO, GO” military drill where he flings you a tissue, you stuff it under your weeping vagina and you proceed to make the awkward duck waddle to the toilet.</p>\n<p>17. Bad BO? GTFO.<br>\nCan’t hide it, can’t deny it. Might be worse than fart stench.</p>\n<p><em>R.Pengsta embraces the awkward and you should, too!</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

In my opinion, the best thing about Halloween is that we get to dress up as whatever the fuck we want, pretend to be someone else for a night and not get judged for it. I’m going to be a French maid this Friday, and I’m planning on using my costume as an opportunity to seduce the guys while I’m out. Come up with some fun, flirty lines that go with your costume and lure in potential partners.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While playing your character at parties is fun, role playing during sex is even better.  With that said, use your costume to your advantage and bring it to the bedroom with you. Gonna be a nurse? Play doctor with the hottie you find and give him a checkup that’s extra thorough. Going out as a cop? Place someone under your arrest (extra points for actually using the handcuffs that come with your costume).</p>\n<p>Make sure that the person behind the mask is actually what you’re looking for.  Last year, one of my friends took home a guy dressed as a zombie. His body was nice, but he was wearing a mask the majority of the night, and she didn’t end up seeing his face until she was too drunk to care. Next morning, she was horrified to find that he had eaten her out with a fat cold sore on his lips — gross! For the sake of your dignity — and not catching the herp — make sure you get a good look at the person you’re flirting with before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>Find your Halloween counterpart. One really fun thing my friends and I try to do on Halloween is find the counterparts to the costumes that we’re wearing. Last year I was a playboy bunny, so I tried to find myself a gay Hugh Hefner to sleep with … while I was unsuccessful, the “straight” Hugh I ended up flipping was really great in bed.  Who doesn’t like a challenge, right?</p>\n<p>Think outside the box.  While it’s I guess it’s okay to be a “slutty cop,” “slutty cat” or “slutty whatever-the-fuck,” it’s even more fun to wear something creative that grabs everyone’s attention. Doing this will make you stand out, and besides, that “slutty mouse” outfit you’re planning on wearing is more basic than the Pumpkin Spice Latte I’m drinking right now. My sophomore year, I went out as Twitter. Rocking blue tights, a blue feather hat, no shirt and a whiteboard around my neck, people wrote tweets on me all night. One such tweet, “I want to eat @matttogni’s ass #ButtReally #PunIntended,” actually got me laid.  Hooray for cheesy hashtags, am I right?</p>\n<p>BDSM. While this could totally go under the “roleplaying” tip, I like BDSM so much that I decided to give it its own section — because seriously, what’s hotter than being tied up in a chair while someone tells you to beg them for sex. I think that this one’s pretty self-explanatory, so have fun playing your best horror movie fantasies and get crazy. On Saturday when I go out as a cop, expect that I’ll use my baton in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>Safety. Wanna know the scariest part of Halloween? The fact that many of us are going to get laid, and that 1 in 4 sexually active college students have an STD (source: Centers for Disease Control). With that said, I know that most of us are  going to be wearing next to nothing this weekend, but use your bras or underwear to stash a condom or two to ensure that you can be safe when doing the dirty … because who wants to be a part of that statistic? Not me. Ew.</p>\n<p>Consent. I know I talk about this in literally every article that I write, but it’s really important to make sure that both you and your partner give consent before you have sex. Only yes means yes. End of story.</p>\n<p>Despite the out-of-towners, countless cops and lack of parking that Halloween is bound to entail, there’s a reason why it’s famous here in Isla Vista … it’s a fucking blast! In all honesty, the biggest tip I can give y’alls is to simply let loose and have fun. Don’t be a buzzkill this weekend, dress up, because I’m sorry, but I don’t wanna be the only half-naked French maid out there on Friday night.</p>\n<p>Happy Halloween, happy Halloweekend, and happy humping, folks!</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni has no problem admitting that he’s a little bit of a basic bitch.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Everyone knows how taboo the subject is, and while it’s actually kind of funny to think that talking about one form of sex is more socially acceptable than talking about another, anal really takes more shit from society than it deserves. Here’s my beef: Last weekend at some party, my friends were having a raunchy conversation about their best lays in Isla Vista. These were my straight friends mind you, and as they went on and on about things like crazy sex in the library or getting head for an hour straight, I decided that I wanted to share too. Now my sex is gay sex and once I brought up the real missionary position, everyone’s voices went silent while their disapproving eyes screamed, “TMI!” Left standing there in the awkwardness I thought, “No guys, you don’t know what you’re missing.” But that’s when it hit me harder than the boy in my story: They didn’t know what they were missing because they literally couldn’t relate to me at all. Today, we talk anal because I realized last weekend that it’s nothing to be anal about in the first place, and everyone needs to realize that.</p>\n<p>Whether you like it or not, the skin lining your anus has a ridiculously high concentration of nerve endings, so nobody — boys or girls, gays or straights — should be afraid of exploring back there to get some extra OOMPF in their sex lives. Guys, ever heard of your prostate gland? Well it’s essentially the closest thing we have to a g-spot and it’s located right along the anal wall about three inches up the rectum. You might think you’ve all experienced orgasms but imagine getting it without the penile stimulation! This might sound strange but it’s just one reality of anal play that most straight couples never get to experience. In fact, studies show that while 90 percent of gay couples have tried anal sex, only 10 percent of straight couples have done the same, meaning that the majority of people are missing out on an experience that is literally orgasmic.</p>\n<p>And while many people are afraid to pay a visit to the oh-so-dirty south, I’m here to let you know that that’s totally all right. I get it. I know how you feel, but as a gay man, my v-card was going to be swiped up the rear by default and you know what I’ve learned from the whole experience? Once you go crack, you never go back.

It seems like every day, someone is asking me how to do the dirty — literally — and for those I’ve enlightened, rewards literally came. The information I’m about to share with you is historically proven to make you way more than a person’s one-night-stand and has been tried, tested and perfected quite a bit over the years. So take a deep breath, throw your preconceived notions about anal out the window and prepare yourself, because I’m going to be your guide through the back door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>\n<p>By nature anal play requires a little prep — no one wants to find chocolate M&amp;Ms in the bedroom, and some anal play requires cleanliness for the sake of safety. No more than four hours before sex, use the restroom and make sure you are wiped, clean and ready to go down there. If you’re extra anal, wash out the inside of your rectum at the end of a hot shower when your anal sphincters are relaxed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong></p>\n<p>You have two anal sphincter muscles that control the opening of your anus. You can voluntarily control the outer sphincter, but the inner sphincter is controlled by the involuntary nervous system and clenches in response to stress.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Communication:</strong></p>\n<p>Because anal touching, licking, kissing or fucking might be a new experience for your partner, keep good lines of communication open and make sure he/she is comfortable with what you are about to do.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Foreplay:</strong></p>\n<p>If you really want to spice up the moments leading up to sex, try anal foreplay! A rim job involves spreading your partner’s butt cheeks apart and licking the rim of the anus … it might sound weird, but rim jobs create some of the most powerful sensations that the body can experience. If you’re a little turned off by A2M (ass-to-mouth), try stroking the area lightly with your fingers instead. With a male partner, you’ll win extra points if you tickle the fold of skin along his perineum, occasionally moving towards his sack … once you notice him squirming in pleasure, you know you’re doing it right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Lubricant and Condoms:</strong></p>\n<p>If you feel ready to go to the next level with your anal play, make sure you have lubricant and condoms. While any water-based lubricant will do, I suggest Astroglide for its the long-lasting and slick consistency. As for condoms, avoid flavored or “sensation-inducing” types. Your rectum is lined with very sensitive skin, and it’s best to stick with basic latex rubbers to ensure both safety and comfort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Insertion:</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure that the receiving partner’s anus is well-lubricated and that he/she feels relaxed … again, one of your sphincters is controlled by the stress response, so in a sense, you have to want to receive for this to work (girls who’ve experienced accidental dick-slips get why). To begin, slowly stick one lubricated finger into the anus, gliding it in and out to simulate gentle sex. When your partner feels comfortable with this, add more fingers until he/she is prepared for the “D.” Once in, have fun! Anal ejaculation is completely safe and don’t be afraid to experiment with your own positions to keep things exciting!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ultimately, anal sex really is one of the most thrilling ways to pleasure your partner. Boy or girl, gay or straight, if you’re sick of the ol’ missionary, over the reverse cowgirl or done with doggy style, run to CVS, grab your favorite lube, throw on a rubber and spice up your sex life! There’s an unexpected item in the bagging area, but guess what, you like it.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is currently on his way to the nearest CVS.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
