Community Services District (CSD) has not yet decided the program’s specifics but board members have called its creation a “top priority.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB3\">Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3)</a>, which paved the way for the I.V. CSD’s creation with its passage in 2015, provided the district the power to create a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand gave a presentation about similar tenant mediation programs during the CSD’s Tuesday meeting and said I.V. residents have reached out for assistance with tenant-landlord mediation in the past.</p>\n<p>I.V. residents contacted the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program for help 64 times in the 2014 to 2015 fiscal year. This is the highest usage rate of by an unincorporated area of the county and nearly double the rate of the community with the second highest usage, according to the presentation.</p>\n<p>Tenants reached out to the mediation program mostly for security deposit refunds, lease terminations, habitability and repair issues and rent increase disputes.</p>\n<p>IVTU provides education and advocacy for tenants and some case work for rental housing issues and the UCSB Community Housing Office provides some dispute resolution and mediation.</p>\n<p>The Legal Aid Foundation of Santa Barbara County also provides information about tenants’ rights and responsibilities, but there is yet to be a service that unites all areas of tenant-landlord issues for all residents.</p>\n<p>Bertrand compared mediation programs in the cities of Palo Alto and Santa Barbara to I.V., which he said has a need for a similar program considering the size of the population and its requests for help from tenant organizations.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Tuesday’s discussion was the board of directors’ first time discussing tenant-landlord mediation programs and said he hopes to discuss the program’s creation with other I.V. stakeholders as the board moves forward.</p>\n<p>If the CSD chooses, it can make its mediation program mandatory through an ordinance, though a majority of board members have said they would first like to create a successful voluntary program before mandating mediation for disputes.</p>\n<p>He said some tenant mediation programs passed by local governments have included provisions for mandatory mediation programs but believes public input is necessary before the CSD makes any program mandatory.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to learning more about the community’s desire for a tenant mediation program and ordinance … The purpose of last night’s presentation was to show examples of what other communities have done to bolster tenant protections,” Bertrand said in an email.</p>\n<p>Some board members have come out in favor of a mandatory tenant mediation program but also say the program must acquire funding and become effective before it can ever become mandatory.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board member Bob Geis said the district should fund the program through the user utility tax that the board is working to bring to the voters by next year.</p>\n<p>Board members are still debating the exact percentage of the tax that will go on next year’s ballot. The utility tax fell short of the 66 percent vote it needed last year, with 61.22 percent of the vote, when Measure F asked voters for an 8 percent tax on Nov. 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD board member and secretary, said a mediation program could create a difference in the way that landlords treat tenants.</p>\n<p>“Customer service to their tenants is not something that is prioritized or even needed because our rental housing market is just so — there’s no choice … There’s no places you can go if you don’t like your landlord,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said a mandatory program similar to the city of Palo Alto’s could make landlords more responsive when it comes to repairs, security deposit issues and resolving other disputes.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In the fifth inning a sac fly by sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier and a big two-RBI single by redshirt sophomore outfielder Josh Adams gave them a solid 5-1 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>The game was sealed in the seventh inning when Adams hit a big two-run homer to give his team a 7-1 lead. UCSB gave up two runs in the ninth inning, however, it still hung on and won the game 7-3. Redshirt sophomore Joe Record had a great outing on Sunday on allowing three hits and one run with five strikeouts in seven innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Our guys did a good job.” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We did a great job on the mound, Joe [record] had a solid game.”</p>\n<p>Before Santa Barbara achieved the sweep, it first had to play a doubleheader, something that is tough for any team. However, the Gauchos had a fast start in the late game that made it a bit easier for them.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out firing offensively scoring three runs in the first inning. After two Dons runs in the second inning, the Gauchos responded by scoring two runs of their own, including a great homerun by Calica, and maintaining a three run lead at 5-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s most effective inning came in the bottom of the fourth when it scored six runs and took a solid 11-2 lead. It eventually won the game 13-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos offensive prowess was highlighted by all nine hitters recording at least one hit and the team having 19 hits as a whole. Calica’s 3-5 day, which included the aforementioned homerun, and sophomore Clay Fisher four singles were notable performances in UCSB’s great offensive day.</p>\n<p>In the earlier game, Santa Barbara had an early scare when they found themselves down 5-1 heading in the bottom of the sixth inning. The Dons offense was led by junior outfielder Harrison Bruce who went 2-4 with 3 RBI and junior Dan James who hit the first homerun of the season for the Dons in the second inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos comeback effort began in the sixth inning when Plantier started the three-run rally with a single. Four of the next six UCSB batters got hits which led to the three runs that cut the Dons lead to just one.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara completed its comeback in the eighth inning when junior outfielder Devon Gradford hit a sac fly that put two runners in scoring position. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark batted the two runners and give his team a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>The Dons tried to put together an effort in the final inning, however, the offense dried out as sophomore Kyle Nelson pitched a 1-2-3 inning to seal the victory for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Before UCSB played a brutal doubleheader, in its season opener redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno had the game of his life to lead his team that day. The second baseman had a solid hitting day going 3-5 with 4 RBI and came just a single shy of hitting the cycle.</p>\n<p>“I was floating out there for a while.” Muno said. “I had no idea what was going on it was amazing.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos season started hot with three scores in the first inning which began with Muno’s double. Plantier batted in his second baseman with a single and redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover hit in two more runners later in the inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB allowed one run at the top of the second but Muno hit a two-RBI triple that gave his team a 5-1 lead. The sophomore’s homerun in the fourth inning gave the Gauchos a commanding 7-1 lead.</p>\n<p>After taking a 7-1 lead, Santa Barbara gave up one run but also added one to win the game 8-2 and start the season off the right way, with a win.</p>\n<p>“We were pretty solid defensively.” Checketts said. “We did a lot of good things and got a good lead early.”</p>\n<p>Right-handed pitcher Shane Beiber had a solid outing going seven innings deep and only allowing two runs. The junior also had four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“I thought our guys on the mound did a great job.” Checketts said. “Beiber was in character and threw some solid strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos perfect start to the season is a great sign of things to come. The young team seemed poise to battle and showed fans new players that seem as though they will contribute a lot to this team.</p>\n<p>“There was so much offensive production,” Checketts said. “I was happy with performances from guys like Clark, Muno. Clark in particular hits in the nine-hole and when your ninth batter bats .450 that’s a good sign.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday at 2 p.m. against St. Mary’s at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Tate has also logged 100 strikeouts, the second most thrown in the conference this season.</p>\n<p>Junior lefty Justin Jacome and sophomore righty Shane Bieber also appear on the strikeout leaderboard. Both have tossed 85 overall strikeouts this season.</p>\n<p>Riverside is bringing the No. 25-27 best ERAs in the conference to the mound this weekend, led by senior pitcher Joie Dunyon’s 4.85 ERA.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders also bring the Big West’s 10th-ranked batting average to the plate against UCSB’s decorated pitching staff. Sophomore outfielder Vince Fernandez has hit six home runs this season and racks a .318 batting average. Another big hitter for Riverside has been senior infielder Joe Chaves, who holds a .307 batting average with 14 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Following this weekend, the final conference seeding will be decided and postseason game times and locations will be announced. Fullerton currently holds the conference’s top spot.

Then in the third inning junior outfielder Hunter Mercado-Hood hit a sac fly to the deep right and tied the game at one.</p>\n<p>The Toreros then enjoyed a brief 2-1 lead after the top of the fourth as they added one run. The Gauchos responded with a three-run frame that was led by freshman outfielder Michael McAdoo hitting a fielder’s choice that batted one runner in and an error on the play led to another runner scoring. Senior third baseman Ryan Clark hit an RBI single and made the score 4-2 after four full frames.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its hot hitting in the fifth after another three-run bottom frame that seemingly put San Diego away as it could not answer back to that extent. UCSB sealed the championship victory after adding two more runs, compared to SD’s one run, and winning by a final score of 9-3.</p>\n<p>Designated hitter Austin Bush led the team going 3-3 in the championship round adding three runs scored as well. The sophomore was also honored with tournament MVP after a 7-11 weekend which included six RBI and one homer.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore Joe Record also continued his strong start to the season picking up his second win after going 6 1/3 innings deep allowing four hits and two earned runs.</p>\n<p>However, before the Gauchos had the opportunity to take home some nice hardware they first had to defeat previously undefeated Bryant University. They were able to punch their ticket to the championship game and hand the Bulldogs their first loss of the season after their best offensive showing of the year scoring 16 runs on 14 hits.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, Bryant started the scoring in the top of the third adding one run courtesy of junior Matt Albanese, however, it missed out on a great opportunity blowing a bases loaded scenario with only one out in the inning. It was Clark who made a diving catch when the ball was hit his way and turned it into a 5-4-3 double play.</p>\n<p>The senior then continued to help his team hitting his first home-run of the season and tying the game up at one. The Gauchos added three more runs to take a 4-1 lead after three innings of play.</p>\n<p>The game was still somewhat close as the score was 6-2 headed into the seventh inning when UCSB scored seven runs in that frame to put away Bryant. It continued to show its dominance adding three more runs in the final two innings to win the game by an impressive 16-2 score.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore J.J Muno continued his hot start to the season going 2-3 with two RBI. He was helped by Grover who went a perfect 3-3 and also had two RBI. Although the Gauchos had great hitting they were also helped by the Bulldogs eight walks and hitting six additional batters that attributed four runs.</p>\n<p>Pitching was also great as Freshman Noah Davis picked up his first win of the season after five strong innings allowing six hits and two runs while also adding four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Before the Gauchos best offensive output of the season, they had a strong start to the tournament against No. 22 Kentucky. UCSB scored 11 runs on 14 hits and had another strong performance from Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>The junior right-handed pitcher was amazing at one point not allowing a single run until the seventh inning. Bieber then ran out of gas as he was ultimately pulled one out into the sixth inning after allowing three singles. He still picked up the win putting his record at a perfect 2-0.</p>\n<p>Bieber was also helped tremendously by yet another dominant performance by the Gaucho hitters. Five UCSB hitters got extra base hits including Bush’s 430-foot homerun in the top of the seventh inning. The future tournament MVP started his weekend strong going 3-5 and having two RBI.</p>\n<p>The scoring started early for Santa Barbara as it took a 3-0 lead after three runs in the second inning thanks to McAdoo’s RBI single, sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI groundout and Clark’s RBI single. Clark picked up another RBI in the fourth inning after a solid single down the left field line making the score 4-0.</p>\n<p>As Kentucky was unable to score, the Gauchos decided to take advantage scoring four more runs in the fifth inning to take a commanding 8-0 lead. UCSB led 10-0 after the top of the seventh thanks to Bush’s aforementioned HR and Clark’s third RBI of the day.</p>\n<p>Although Kentucky made a strong push in the bottom of the seventh frame scoring three runs, the deficit was too much to overcome and it lost to Santa Barbara 11-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB saw great performances from mostly every player that took part in the game whether it be on the mound or on the plate. All its starters collected at least one hit and only one did not score a run. It was a dominant performance all around yet then again so was the whole tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did a great job of bouncing back after its first loss of the season. Instead of sulking they went out and outscored their three weekend opponents by a score of 36-9.
