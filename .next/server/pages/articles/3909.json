In the June 7 primary, Democrat Joan Hartmann took a lead of 42.8 percent over opponent Bruce Porter, who gained 35.5 percent.</p>\n<p>Bruce Porter, who is supported by the Republican Party, has registered voters at several campus spots and attended Pardall Carnival last weekend to garner support, but his registration tactics have drawn severe scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Porter hired Terry Baxter as his Isla Vista field director in July, one month after the primary election. Baxter was a former campaign assistant for Steve Pappas, who the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2008-05-27/for-3rd-district-supervisor-the-daily-nexus-strongly-endorses-steve-pappas/\" target=\"_blank\">endorsed </a>during his race for Third District Supervisor in 2008.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"m_8610659200238821933gmail-docs-internal-guid-62726dd1-98b9-879a-f4c3-165575577e28\">“I don’t have a deathbed conversion here.

The case was ultimately <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-03-30/pappas-case-thrown-out/\" target=\"_blank\">dismissed</a> due to lack of evidence, and Pappas was made to pay all court fees.</p>\n<p>Baxter’s background does not sit well with those observing Porter’s campaign in I.V., and several political operatives are equally unhappy with his current approach to registration.</p>\n<p>“We want to make sure that everybody we register knows they have a choice, that they can register at home or register here,” he told the Nexus, responding to allegations his campaign has attempted to stifle the student vote by reducing its concentration in the Third District.</p>\n<p>He stands by his decision to appoint Baxter to his staff, and said, “Terry Baxter is not going around telling people not to register to vote.”</p>\n<p>“That would be absolutely silly and un-American,” he said. “If she did, I would fire her on the spot. That would be absolutely wrong.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann, whose campaign has been vocal about their mistrust of Porter, said her connection to students began long ago and is rooted in community involvement.</p>\n<p><span id=\"m_8610659200238821933gmail-docs-internal-guid-62726dd1-98b9-879a-f4c3-165575577e28\">“I don’t have a deathbed conversion here,” she said. “I have a life of being connected to student communities.”</span></p>\n<p>The parties continue to battle for voters, and efforts from organizers involved with the UCSB Voter Registration Volunteer Coalition have reached over 5,000 registrations.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, leader of the Yes on E&amp;F campaign and supporter of Joan Hartmann, said the group aims to reach 13,000 votes in the next 18 days before the last day to register for the general election.</p>\n<p>“Individuals are transient, but our demographics are not,” Abboud said, adding that the I.V. vote will continue to be relevant long after the current class of students is gone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We want to make sure that everybody we register knows they have a choice, that they can register at home or register here.”</p>\n<p>— Bruce Porter</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jay Freeman, who came in third to Porter and lost the primary in the Third District Race, has thrown his hat in the ring to register voters as well, but he said his team aimed for the “high hanging fruit” in months before and after the June election.</p>\n<p>He has supported Hartmann, and several of his supporters say they will vote for her in the November general election, but he is unhappy with both candidates running for the supervisor position. Freeman is not a registered Democrat and said the race for the Third District has reaffirmed his decision against doing so.</p>\n<p>Freeman added that the idea of political representation in I.V. is very subjective, and though voter registration is essential, the I.V. vote also suppresses the vote of agriculture land in the rest of the Third District and the Santa Ynez Valley. A balanced election would require full voter participation from all areas.</p>\n<p>Political tension runs high in the months before the primary, and Freeman, as well as Andrew Gabriel Pragin, a supporter and former UCSB student, expressed concern that Democratic voter registration tactics were dissuading others from being engaged in the election.</p>\n<p>Abboud denied that the party encourages voters to side with Democrats, and said “we do nonpartisan voter registration when we need to. We do it because we care about voters.”</p>\n<p>Students and candidates campaigning for the crucial I.V. vote have found themselves at the center of a crossfire between party lines, and the intensity of the environment continues to increase.</p>\n<p>Democrats hoped to espouse the idea that “Isla Vista is united,” Pragin said, but the campaign continues to forge a split between political activists in the crucial election.</p>\n<p>“It provides a front of openness, transparency,” he said. “In reality, they’re doing quite a lot of work to make it seem that way.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em> under the headline “Isla Vista at the Heart of Third District Vote.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/isla-vista-divided-by-party-politics-in-supervisor-race/","id":3909,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3908,3907,3906],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. - Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Audacity of Douche</b><br>\nFri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. – Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.</p>\n<p>Minutes earlier, a young man was driving down the 6800 block of DP when a drunken savage came out of nowhere and leaped onto the roof of his car. Taken aback, the driver stepped on the gas and then abruptly hit the brakes in the hopes of shaking the crazed reveler, but succeeded only in shifting his body onto the hood.</p>\n<p>Reacting to this boorish move by the driver, the inebriated cowboy stood up on the hood, shouted “What the fuck?!” and slammed his heel through the front windshield, shattering it instantly.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived some minutes later, and, thanks to their superb training, were able to track down the suspect without difficulty. It was made easier, however, by the fact that their man had managed to fall asleep while standing.</p>\n<p>The officers woke the 20-year-old Menlo Park resident and put him in handcuffs. Having been read his Miranda rights, the vandal turned to the officer and said, “I would like to know what I’m being charged with.” The deputy explained that kicking through a windshield is in fact a crime, to which the suspect replied, “I just want to know what I’m being charged with.”</p>\n<p>Despite several explanations, the inebriated man was unable to comprehend why he was arrested. Nonetheless, the audacious young man was transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>How Not to Win Him Back</b><br>\nThu Jan. 7, 1:15 a.m. – Deputies on patrol were called to an apartment at 760 Embarcadero del Mar early Thursday on reports that an especially intoxicated young lady refused to leave her ex’s abode.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and found the inebriated 21-year-old in the living room searching for something. She told the deputies she wouldn’t leave without her cell phone battery, but after a moving good cop/bad cop routine, the officers were able to convince her otherwise.</p>\n<p>Love is a difficult beast to break, however. An hour and a half later, the deputies received another call saying that the girl had returned, this time with even more alcohol on her breath. The deputies arrived and escorted her out of the apartment and down the stairs.</p>\n<p>At first refusing to answer any questions, the UCSB student quickly changed tactics and demanded that the officers take her to jail. To prove she was serious, she then ordered them to do so.</p>\n<p>Happy to oblige, the deputies took her to the I.V. substation, where she insisted they give her a breathalyzer test. The deputy instructed her that was not necessary, but she continued to demand one.</p>\n<p>The issue was put to rest, however, when the officers transferred her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/","id":3906,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3905,3904,3903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Exciting Events Happening in Isla Vista This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I.V. politics will be popping this week, what with the Third Disrict County Supervisor debate, the push to register at least 13,000 I.V. residents to vote for the November election.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Get the low-down on all things I.V. for the week, from the return of First Fridays to SBCF’s monthly food distribution</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_72921\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72921\" data-attachment-id=\"72921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/vista-point-by-mclane-brown/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"vista-point-by-mclane-brown\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72921\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"I.V. politics will be popping this week, what with the Third Disrict County Supervisor debate, the push to register at least 13,000 I.V. residents to vote for the November elections and the meeting for the future of the IVCC.

Though a significant amount of the country voted to put a woman in the highest office in the land, others are more concerned about what the candidate’s policies were.</p>\n<p>Eileen Boris, professor in the Department of Feminist Studies at UCSB, said feminist leaders are necessary, and while the gender of the president is significant, it is more important for there to be a feminist, in particular, in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>“I think it makes more of a difference [if] we have a feminist in the White House … It makes more of a difference not the embodiment of the person but the policies of a person,” Professor Boris said.</p>\n<p>As for what particular policies a feminist would bring into office, Boris said, a feminist in office will bring a commitment to what is often called the ‘working family dilemma,’ that is, how do we organize the relationship between getting a living and daily life.”</p>\n<p>In local politics, Joan Hartmann secured the Third District Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors seat on Tuesday, beating rival Bruce Porter 13,563 to 11,511.</p>\n<p>When asked whether Hartmann’s election to the board of supervisors would make a difference in the community, Boris seemed to summarize many of the general election’s prevailing tensions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74136\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1780941814\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74125\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74136\" data-attachment-id=\"74136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/local-women-gain-power-in-government/hbj-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hbj-by-jenny-luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74136\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Hannah-Beth Jackson speaks to a supporter at the Democrat watch party Tuesday.
