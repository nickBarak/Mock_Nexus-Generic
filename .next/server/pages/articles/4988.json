The driving force behind SMU’s prosperous rise is senior setter Avery Acker.</p>\n<p>A two-time All-American Honorable Mention, Acker leads the American Athletic Conference in assists per set with 11.96. She helped the Mustangs win their five-set battle versus New Mexico last Saturday with a season-high 58 assists. Her career total of 3,000 plus assists ranks her sixth all-time in SMU history.</p>\n<p>Another key counterpart to the Mustangs success is junior Morgan Heise. The 2014 American Athletic Libero of the Year, Heise set an SMU single-season record with 626 digs. The Mustangs 17.70 digs per set ties them with UCF for a conference-high this season.</p>\n<p>Expect another MVP-esque performance from senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau to combat SMU’s fierce defense. The Yale Invitational Co-MVP, Barbeau leads the Gauchos in kills with 81 and is just one dig away from being tied for second on the team at 58 after recording a career-high 18 digs against Yale.</p>\n<p>“Our serving improved, which helps our defense,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “It puts more pressure on other teams and makes it easier for our defense to set up for digs and blocks.”</p>\n<p>Next on Santa Barbara’s schedule is the University of San Diego. UCSB’s first ranked opponent, the 5-1 Toreros are also on a four-game winning run after hosting its own invitational last weekend.</p>\n<p>Leading USD in its superb home performance was redshirt junior middle blocker Lisa Kramer. She was awarded with All-Tournament honors after accumulating a total of 30 kills, 12 blocks, and a .397 hitting percentage. Kramer is currently tied for the team-lead in attacking percentage at a clip of .286.</p>\n<p>Having a breakout season for San Diego is junior middle blocker Lauren Schad. She finished last weekend with a total of 19 blocks and owns a team-high of 38. Her mastery of the block ranks her at the top of the West Coast Conference as she averages 1.68 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>Securing the net for the Gauchos are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield. Grunt’s 6’4” stature along with Sheffield’s vertical bounce have complimented each other well so far this year. The two have combined for a total of 48 blocks this season.</p>\n<p>Since losing last week’s tournament finale to Rhode Island, UCSB has been more proactive in preparing for its upcoming matches.</p>\n<p>“We really pinpointed certain things that we need to work on to make sure that we don’t make the same errors again,” Sheffield said. “We’re going to make sure that we figure out what those teams are really good at doing and make sure that we can shut it down.”</p>\n<p>Ending the Gauchos’ home debut is a contest versus UCLA. The Bruins’ come into UCSB with a 4-1 overall record and are on a three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>As one of eight nationally ranked teams from a talented Pac-12 Conference, UCLA will be no easy exit for the Gauchos. A transfer from West Virginia this offseason, junior outside hitter Jordan Anderson has been an absolute stud in her first season as a Bruin. Her efficiency when attacking has been valuable to UCLA’s offense as she ranks third in the Pac-12 in kills per set averaging 4.38.</p>\n<p>UCSB definitely has its work cut out for itself this weekend. Some may consider UCSB to be the underdog even on home territory, but should not be underestimated when playing in the Thunderdome as the possibility of an upset awaits.</p>\n<p>UCSB starts its invitational tomorrow, Sept. 11<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m. versus SMU.

Recently, UCSB fell out of the AVCA Division I-II poll for the first time this season, while BYU currently sits at No. 3 in the nation.</p>\n<p>The fall from the rankings can be attributed to a tough Spring Break, which saw the Gauchos drop two matches. The first loss came against Cal Baptist, giving CBU its second conference win of the season, and a much more crucial loss to USC put them in jeopardy of missing the conference tournament after giving the Trojans the one-game lead.</p>\n<p>The loss at USC was a big blow for UCSB, but hope is not yet completely lost. USC does control its own fate, but two losses to Cal Baptist this week, paired with at least one Gaucho win and a CSUN win against top-ranked Long Beach State, can propel UCSB into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Losers of their last three matches, the Gauchos must find a way to turn things around if they want to squeeze their way into the MPSF tournament. BYU, currently second in the conference and playing for a chance at the No. 1 seed, certainly won’t be an easy matchup for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Cougars have five players with triple-digit kills, four of whom have over two kills per set. Jake Langois, a towering 6-10 senior outside hitter, leads the team with 287 kills and 38 service aces.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76613\" style=\"width: 369px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76613\" data-attachment-id=\"76613\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/final-seed-of-mpsf-tournament-at-stake-as-ucsb-will-take-on-byu/03-11-mensvballlewis-ericswensonnexus-10-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web.jpg?fit=1367%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1367,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76613\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web-684x1024.jpg?resize=359%2C538\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-10-web.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76613\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Parker Boehle takes a second ball after the setter was forced to pass. <em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Junior setter Leo Durkin is the team facilitator, having racked up 816 assists in the 2017 season. Junior middle blocker Price Jarman, 6’9,” and senior middle blocker Joseph Grosh, 6’7,” have both posted the lion’s share of BYU blocks, with 67 and 68 blocks, respectively.</p>\n<p>Boasting an overall record of 21-3, including a 14-2 conference record, the Cougars are clearly a force to be reckoned with. The team strung together 14 straight wins between Jan. 28 and March 25, until they dropped the second game in a two-match series against No. 1 Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match in Santa Barbara will be BYU’s first since that loss versus LBSU. That’s a lot of time off to accumulate rust, or alternatively, to rest up and prepare. UCSB is certainly hoping for the former.</p>\n<p>Both Jacob Delson and Parker Boehle will be playing to extend their college careers on Thursday and Friday, something that should serve as a major motivator for those players. Delson and Boehle are both redshirt seniors and top contributors for the Gauchos, as Delson leads the team with 341 kills while Boehle has a team-high 182 digs.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need both seniors at their best against BYU if the team wants to make the postseason. Really, every player that steps on the court on Thursday and Friday will need to be at their best, given the caliber of the competition.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ playoff hopes depend heavily on forces outside of the team’s control, but UCSB needs to get the job done on their end in order for those outside forces to have any impact.

The last name Boehle appeared three times on the 2017 UCSB men’s volleyball roster, as Hayden, now a junior, and Davis, a freshman redshirt, defied the odds and embraced the timing to join their older brother.</p>\n<p>“It started getting a little better when [Hayden and Davis] started getting recruited,” Parker said. “I was like, ‘Wow, this might actually happen’… And now here we all are. It’s pretty crazy.”</p>\n<p>The 2017 season, which recently ended with the Gauchos going 10-16 overall and missing out on the MPSF postseason tournament, didn’t go exactly as the Boehles might have hoped. Davis never actually got to see the court at the same time as his brothers, as he followed in Parker’s footsteps by redshirting his freshman season.</p>\n<p>That said, being on the same team and on the same campus washed away some of the stings for the Boehle trio. Years of playing and living together created a bond that goes beyond that of normal teammates, something that shows on the court.</p>\n<p>“We know we have our backs,” Davis said. “We know we’re there for each other. When we’re down, we pick each other up. You just know that you have your best friend on the court with you.”</p>\n<p>Parker, Hayden, and Davis didn’t just stumble upon volleyball by accident. Michael Boehle, their father, is in his 19th year as head coach of the boy’s volleyball team at Loyola High School, currently the top team in the nation. All three Boehle boys played for their father there, but their volleyball roots go even deeper than just high school.</p>\n<p>“We all started playing when we were super young,” Hayden said. “We have a little grass court in our backyard, so we started probably when we were around eight to 10.”</p>\n<p>Michael Boehle, naturally, played a pivotal role in cultivating his three sons’ love for the game. The elder Boehle played beach volleyball professionally back in the day and has won six CIF Southern Section titles at the helm of the Loyola squad. A resume like that gives a dad a lot to teach his kids about the sport.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably the most important person in my career in terms of volleyball,” Parker said. “He taught me the game. He showed me how to compete and how to lead.”</p>\n<p>Volleyball isn’t just a boy’s thing in the Boehle family, however. Parker, Hayden, and Davis have a younger sister named Ella, who is currently a junior on the volleyball team at Notre Dame Academy in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“It’s been pretty funny watching her grow up and be able to compete with us in the backyard,” Davis said. “She used to have to watch from the sidelines, but now she can hold her own with us.”</p>\n<p>There’s only one non-volleyballer in the Boehle clan: Lisa Boehle, mother of UCSB’s sibling triangle. That doesn’t stop her from joining in on backyard matches, though.</p>\n<p>“She’s probably the only one in our entire family who can’t play volleyball,” Parker said. “We give her a hard time, but she’ll go out there and she has fun with it. She’s a great sport.”</p>\n<p>As might be expected, the shared volleyball upbringing has left the Boehle brothers with some similarities as players. All three consider ball control one of their greatest strengths as well as volleyball IQ.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76901\" style=\"width: 391px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76901\" data-attachment-id=\"76901\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/hayden-boehle-swings-over-the-top-of-the-block-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FEAT-03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-17-print.jpg?fit=1863%2C1863&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1863,1863\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hayden Boehle swings over the top of the block.

Hayden plays outside hitter for the most part, while Parker and Davis both play at the libero position. That pattern carries over to communication, as Parker and Davis both outtalk the middle sibling on the court by a significant amount.</p>\n<p>Indeed, all three brothers noted an every-other pattern in their family. Parker and Davis look and act alike, while Hayden and Ella share some major characteristics between each other.</p>\n<p>“Hayden’s a lot like my sister,” Parker said. “It’s kind of like me and Davis and then Hayden and my sister; the two pairs have a lot of similar traits. My sister kind of acts like Hayden did when he was in high school, and then I see a lot of things that Davis does that I used to do back then.”</p>\n<p>“We look alike,” Davis said of his similarities to Parker. “Literally, there will be times where we think the same thing without knowing it and be like, ‘Wow, that’s kind of crazy.’”</p>\n<p>Parker and Davis do bear a major resemblance to one another, with one small difference: Davis’ broken nose. That’s thanks to none other than Hayden, who smashed a ball right through Davis’ hands in a backyard volleyball match.</p>\n<p>Anyone with siblings can tell you that such injuries are just a part of life growing up, and Davis certainly doesn’t seem to hold a grudge against his brother for the incident. At least Gaucho volleyball fans had better hope he doesn’t since they’ll be sharing a court come next season.</p>\n<p>Hayden and Davis will carry on without Parker, who played out his last year of eligibility this past season. Luckily for the three siblings, they all got to share that year on the same campus, thanks to that freshman redshirt that made the math all possible.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76902\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/boehle-to-the-third-power-ucsbs-brotherly-trilogy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76902\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/boehle-to-the-third-power-ucsbs-brotherly-trilogy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/boehle-to-the-third-power-ucsbs-brotherly-trilogy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/boehle-to-the-third-power-ucsbs-brotherly-trilogy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/boehle-to-the-third-power-ucsbs-brotherly-trilogy/","id":4986,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4985,4984,4983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks To Continue Climbing Conference Ladder","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to defeat fellow Big West opponent, CSUN, and try to move up in the conference rankings as playoff time approaches.

Now with a 2-1 record in the Big West, Santa Barbara is tied with No. 9 UCI for third place in the conference standings as well as tied for ninth in the nation.</p>\n<p>The two wins were a major confidence boost for the Gauchos after dropping their season opener at Irvine. With postseason right around the corner, they need to continue performing at this level in order to win their last two games and make a deep run in playoffs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Matadors, who have struggled throughout the season against higher-ranked opponents, are coming into the week with a 10-18 overall record. With a four-game losing streak and a 0-4 Big West record, CSUN sits in last place in conference.</p>\n<p>Odds point to Santa Barbara for this weekend after winning all 10 games played against lower ranked teams; however, this does not mean that the Gauchos have nothing to worry about. The last time these two teams faced off, it was the Matadors who came out on top 8-6 in last season’s conference play.</p>\n<p>“Momentum is on our side with the two victories last weekend, but the Big West is the most competitive conference.” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “Every team is competitive and can win on any given day.  It is critical we are present and attack every possession on both ends of the pool.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s main threat is Madeleine Sanchez. CSUN’s sophomore attacker leads the Big West with 66 goals in total, averaging 2.36 per game in her 28 matches this year. The Murrieta-native tallied 28 goals her freshman season as a Matador, third on the team and reached a team-high of six goals in a 14-8 win over Azusa Pacific.</p>\n<p>This year, she leads the team in goals as well as assists with 41. Not only is Sanchez an offensive threat, but she has also shown she can defend the ball quite well collecting 53 steals, the second highest in the team.</p>\n<p>With such a sharp shooter in play, the Gauchos’ defense must remain strong throughout the entire game. In past matches Santa Barbara has failed to capitalize when they have a lead and have ended up in tough situations as a result — such as the UCI loss two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>“Last weekend we focused on team defense and getting behind each other no matter what happens.” Coach Kay said. “ We have been focusing on trusting the process throughout the year/season.  This has built a foundation for us to lean on.”</p>\n<p>“The biggest challenge this weekend and for the rest of the season is to trust the process and stay present.” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “This is something that will allow us to be victorious.”</p>\n<p>Apart from the defense, the Gauchos will also need to be efficient on the opposite side of the pool. However, all season they have proven that they can play as a team, and the captain of this team is senior Lauren Martin.</p>\n<p>After redshirting last season, Martin came back with everything she had this year. She has constantly put up big numbers, especially in crucial situations such as sudden deaths. To no surprise, it was her who put away the goal that gave UCSB its victory over Davis last weekend in the 8th quarter.</p>\n<p>Along with Martin, the Gauchos will also look to senior attacker Bryn Hudson to set the pace with her assists. Hudson leads the team with 35 assists, complementing her 35 goals this season. The two have shown great chemistry in the pool, always setting each other up to go for the kill.</p>\n<p>“There are so many things to work on and not much time left.  The focus every day is paying attention to details.” Coach Kay said. “This is what will make the difference in becoming Big West Champions for the first time in program history.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on Cal State Northridge at home this weekend, with tip-off at noon at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-looks-to-continue-climbing-conference-ladder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-looks-to-continue-climbing-conference-ladder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-looks-to-continue-climbing-conference-ladder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-looks-to-continue-climbing-conference-ladder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-looks-to-continue-climbing-conference-ladder/","id":4987,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4986,4985,4984],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
