So for [transfer students] to even be in this position [to graduate], especially people of color, it’s so monumental. It really takes a lot for us to get here and to even graduate from a four-year institution,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think a lot of us expect [to graduate].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for Hernandez, and for the numerous transfer students graduating with the class of 2019, the Transfer Student Graduation is an “acknowledge[ment] that we did beat the statistics and that we are here. You achieved this. You deserve it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second year the Transfer Student Graduation has been held. Last year, the Transfer Student Graduation welcomed around 50 students; this year’s will see over 120, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Transfer Student Graduation Committee is mainly led by fourth-years Neyra Patricio, Katherin Jordan, Sophie Weimer and Hernandez; the committee began planning for graduation during Winter Quarter, according to Hernandez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s budget to hold the entire graduation was $200. This year’s is $2,000, an improvement Hernandez attributes to the Transfer Student Alliance’s transformation from an organization to an Associated Students Boards, Commission and Units (BCU). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hernandez and Patricio, having a transfer student graduation is incredibly important in a number of ways, but particularly because of the unique and shared experiences that transfer students go through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because [the ceremony is] different. Most transfer students only have transfer friends, at least the people that I know, so getting to have a graduation ceremony with people that you know [is good], especially because a lot of transfers value it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all really nervous for it to get here, but we also want it to get here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, who was also involved in the planning of the Transfer Student Graduation during its first year, echoed Patricio’s sentiments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that being on Senate with the 69th Senate and working on the Transfer Student Alliance allowed him to see students “get rewarded for all the hard work they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing it last year, how it impacted and how it meant so much to many students… There’s literally people crying [at the ceremony] and it was very emotional and very intense, but it was good,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Hernandez and Patricio hope the tradition of a transfer student graduation ceremony continues after they both leave UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope we built the tradition and it keeps on going,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s ceremony will be held on June 14 in Bren Courtyard at 5 p.m. There will also be a reception at 6:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lavender Graduation and Pride Awards:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lavender Graduation — a graduation ceremony dedicated toward UCSB students who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community — has been running for 19 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony, alongside the Pride Awards, has served as an “integral part” of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), according to UCSB alumnus ‘18 and RCSGD Programming Coordinator Dwayne Mosbey, who helped plan this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Lavender Graduation] began to create a space for queer and trans students, especially when they were entering spaces they didn’t necessarily feel comfortable in or within an insitution they didn’t feel was serving them,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The planning of this year’s ceremony was a “collaborative effort” between Mosbey, RCSGD Director Craig Leets and Associative Director Quinn Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey explained that in previous years, the Pride Awards used to be separate; this year, they were “rolled together” because both are “made to recognize queer and trans students’ resilience and academic achievement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thought it’d be great for those two to be coupled together,” Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduation ceremony itself is modeled similarly to the typical UCSB graduation, Mosbey said. The ceremony will see graduates “walk” into the Student Resource Building forum, following a welcome ceremony with a number of speakers, which typically includes the vice chancellor, a keynote speaker and a student speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said there are typically 30 to 35 people who partake in the ceremony; this year saw an uptick, rounding out to 45 students. Last year, Mosbey himself was one of the people who walked in the Lavender Graduation ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows the chance for queer and trans students to be recognized outside of the larger ceremony, and [anyone] can come to the Lavender Graduation. [They can express] their most gender expression and gender identity and feel comfortable with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can wear whatever they want and can also decorate their gowns and caps — “This is all about making sure [queer and trans students] feel comfortable and that they feel recognized.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All graduates who go through the Lavender Graduation ceremony are awarded purple cords, while folks who work at the RCSGD and people who win awards receive rainbow tassels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of awards also varies, depending on the number of nominations. This year, 13 awards will be handed out, according to Mosbey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey hopes students who go through the ceremony will take away one key thing: “We’re allowing that space for them to feel supported, [so they] know that throughout their college career, the queer and trans community was here for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that we will continue to be here for them even after they graduate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Lavender Graduation will happen on June 9 between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. in the Student Resource Building forum. </span></p>\n<p><b>Black Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Bolden, a fourth-year biopsychology major and the undergraduate speaker for this year’s Black Graduation, said he almost turned down the opportunity to speak at this year’s ceremony. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was kind of hesitant, just because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do have pretty good experience with public speaking, but I didn’t feel like I wanted to add that [burden] on for myself,” he said. “But then [the offer] gave me a little bit of moment of clarity, because I got a chance to look back and see how far I’ve really come.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of realized that it was a little bit humbling,” Bolden added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden is one of the 55 Black undergraduate and graduate students who will be participating in this year’s Black Graduation ceremony on Saturday, June 15 at noon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Stallworth, co-chair of the organizing committee and second-year sociology and Black studies double major, said it’s important for Black students to have a space where they can come together and celebrate their achievements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The educational system wasn’t really built for people of color in general, but for Black students, we really had to fight for us to have our identity be present on campus,” Stallworth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ceremony is a way for Black students to do just that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth said the ceremony will have a mix of student speakers as well as spoken word, musical performances and slideshows of the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Jeffrey Stewart, from UCSB’s Department of Black Studies, and Professor R. L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy from New York University’s Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science and Humanities, are the two faculty speakers. Meridith Merchant, a psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services, is the closing speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth believes the speakers’ words will leave an impression on the graduating students and is looking forward to hearing from them all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The speech is] sending a message and it’s setting the tone for someone’s life,” he said. “I think it’s just really important to have speakers that really motivate and empower students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth is also happy to see the graduates — many of whom have helped him in his two years at UCSB — step off the stage and onto a new chapter after college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I’m] also just excited to see all the Black grads and be able to celebrate them because I think it’s amazing how they’ve been really mentors for me throughout my time here at UCSB. I get to see them go off, and I get to follow in their footsteps.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden echoed Stallworth’s words, naming several other students who will be graduating alongside him  as inspirations over the past few years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to talking about the achievements of the Black community at UCSB over the past few years, Bolden said he wants to highlight the growth of individual students like Zenzile Riddick and Kuvimbanashe “Eddie” Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class of Black grads is phenomenal. One of my hallmates, she’s going to freakin’ Harvard, that’s amazing, Zenzile. Since first year, I knew she was going to be amazing,” Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said he’s proud to have seen everyone’s growth over the past four years and where they’re all headed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m proud to be part of the 5% that has come through here. I definitely recognize that a lot of people don’t have such a positive outlook of UCSB like I have, not everyone’s been blessed with the great experience that I’ve had here,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[But] after coming here, I think that my pride in being a Black man has done nothing but grown exponentially, because I feel like I’m representing my own people here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A special part of the ceremony for Bolden is the fact that a large portion of the Black graduates participating in the ceremony lived together in the Black Scholars Hall in Santa Rosa during their first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be around each other and enjoy each other’s presence and see each other’s faces and see us finish through,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At typical graduation ceremonies, it’s easy for Black students to feel like less of a community, Bolden said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing us spread so thin isn’t the same, isn’t nearly as powerful for us being together, having our own space, our own ceremony, our own opportunity to recognize one another.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolden said his speech at the Black Graduation ceremony will be one of the first times his family will see him in an academic setting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now this is an opportunity for me to show [my mom] what I’ve been doing this whole time.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Chicanx/Latinx Graduation:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chicanx/Latinx Graduation ceremony is just as much about the community behind students as it is about the graduating students themselves, two of the organizers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesenia Cardenas, a fifth-year chemistry major, and Jessica Arenas, a fourth-year global studies major, agreed their favorite part of the ceremony is when the students walk into Harder Stadium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are asked to bring two people to walk them in as live mariachi music plays in the background and photographers snap photos of them, the two said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students, they feel like they get their degree for family too, so it’s nice that you can walk up there, it’s almost like they’re walking up there with you,” Cardenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas sit on an 11-member organizing committee that begins its work one full year before graduation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s cabinet, which organized the 45th Chicanx/Latinx Graduation being held on Saturday, June 15, 2019 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., was dedicated to giving more voice to graduating students throughout the whole process, Cardenas and Arenas both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year we’ve been focusing a lot on being inclusive of Central American identities because that’s a prominent issue, the erasure of Central Americans,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, Arenas said it can be hard to actually feel that they are supported or represented on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a first-generation student, it’s hard to navigate higher education, and sometimes you don’t see people that look like you, in your classroom settings or even in your living settings sometimes,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like most students enjoy the Chicanx/Latinx Graduation because it celebrates their identity and also their cultural background. They aren’t represented in classrooms, but they do feel represented in the graduation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to infusing the ceremony with various cultural elements, the committee works to ensure that the ceremony caters to family members who attend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ceremony, held in Harder Stadium, will have over 500 students walking the stage. A lot of those students are first-generation and have parents who don’t speak English, Cardenas said, so they will have a translator present so their parents can follow along as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my personal experience, my parents don’t really know what I do here, they just know that I go to school and I’m studying,” Arenas laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Arenas and Cardenas said that while friends and family back home might not understand what they’re studying, they’re still very proud of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d rather them understand the ceremony than just sitting there and see all these names called out. At least with [Chicanx/Latinx Graduation] there’s performances and Spanish,” Arenas said. </span></p>\n<p><b>Undocumented Student Services:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monarch butterfly, adorning a pin which many undocumented graduating students will be wearing as they walk the stage, is a symbol of migration, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator Diana Valdivia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To wear this pin is to recognize the impact migration has had in your life experiences. This pin is a small token of your resiliency and accomplishments,” a small note accompanying the pin reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undocumented Student Services began to distribute the pins to graduating undocumented students last year, Valdivia said.

But I have friends struggling for rent, struggling for tuition. I can’t imagine an added fee,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was the desire to strike a good balance between paying artists for their art and making grad photos as accessible as possible that led her to create the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison was initially going to stake out by Henley Gate alone, but then she decided to post on Facebook about her idea to get more photographers for the event. Once she had heard back from a handful of people, she set up a group chat for everyone to schedule themselves for shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Niko Van Eimeren, one of the photographers at the event, said she signed up to help because she personally understood the struggle graduating students face when paying for end-of-the-year expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fourth-year environmental studies major, Van Eimeren said she herself wasn’t sure if she was going to get her graduation photos taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] a lot of my friends, I took their photos for them at a discounted rate ‘cause I know that it can be really expensive,” Van Eimeren said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alejandra Gularte, one of the students who attended the event to have her photos taken, said she appreciated the event’s impact on both graduating students and photographers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found it was a way to help smaller photographers that maybe wanted to get practice. But also, for me, it’s cheaper, because I pay a lot of money for school,” Gularte said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison gives all the credit for the event to the photographers who signed up to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was only possible because people were volunteering their time to do their photos,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Photography isn’t always something you’d think would be something you could do to help people,” Morrison said.  “Anyone can really do something like this, stuff like this means a lot to people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that as a graduating student, it can be difficult to see all of your friends posting their photos and not be able to afford them yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a good grad photo to give to their mom — it’s like a small thing in your day, but honestly would make someone’s day,” she said. “If you can, take time out of your personal life to do a nice thing once in a while.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year art major Reannah Viray took inspiration from that idea and put her own twist on it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88921\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88921\" data-attachment-id=\"88921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/pay-what-you-can-photography-event-inspires-other-students-to-give-back/pay-what-you-can_sanya-kamidi_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1246&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1246\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pay What You Can_Sanya Kamidi_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88921 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=888%2C553\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray hosted her own pay-what-you-can event for graduating seniors on Wednesday in the Arbor, offering her art services to anyone who wanted their cap decorated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a photographer in high school, so I wish that I could have participated, but I didn’t know how to until it was over, so I was like, ‘what other way can I spare my time to people who don’t have the resources or the income necessarily to get grad caps done?’” Viray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s nice to be able to offer something that could be seen as a luxury to people that can’t afford it.
