In addition to being three of the most pressing issues our nation is currently facing, each is partially derived from and interconnected with toxic masculinity. <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/01/25/origins-of-toxic-masculinity/\">Coined in 2005</a>, the term refers to harmful beliefs and behaviors that constitute society’s expectations of manhood. These include physical aggression, emotional repression and discrimination against women and LGBTQ+ folk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As toxic masculinity rises to prominence on the world stage, it is important to acknowledge its ties to this community. The 2014 Isla Vista shooting sparked a national conversation about the damaging impact of traditional notions of masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of continuing this dialogue, we asked students to share their experiences with toxic masculinity. As these vignettes represent but a fraction of the whole, we encourage readers to share their own stories with one another. By engaging with this issue — and one another — we can move toward individual and collective healing.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88542\" style=\"width: 356px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88542\" data-attachment-id=\"88542\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/students-speak-out-on-toxic-masculinity/masc-paige/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=650%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"masc paige\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=210%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?fit=862%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-88542\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-paige-e1558593655924.png?resize=346%2C411\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"411\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t remember the last time I cried in public. The last time I remember crying outside of my house is when I watched </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Water Horse</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 12 years old (that shit was sad, okay?). Other than that, I’ve pretty much successfully suppressed every negative emotion I’ve since felt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, I thought I was just emotionally tough. I mean, that’s what my environment taught me. Any sign of anger or sadness was weak, and simply funny to an outside audience. Whether it was my collection of friends or my soccer teammates, the rules of being a man were simple: if someone insults you, you better come up with a more brutal snipe back. If you get hit on the soccer field, you better hit the other player back even harder. If someone makes you feel vulnerable, never give them the power of letting them see it. If your “opponent” in any contentious interaction shows vulnerability, you’ve already won. Toxic masculinity at its finest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I prided myself on being “one of the good guys” growing up, I still remained committed to never letting my somber emotions get the best of me. In my eyes, one of the worst things that could happen to me socially was to have my traditional definition of masculinity questioned by my peers. Not being a complete hot-headed asshole like some of my peers had already garnered enough pestering questions and insults. I was not going to concede any more vulnerability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This worked for a good 19 years. However, it was just not sustainable. I never truly opened up to family and friends. I barely acknowledged the emotions of the girls I was involved with. I goofed around and took serious situations, frankly, not seriously enough. Overall, I pretended I was perfectly fine and in control of my life. As an assortment of family, social and other issues started to pile up, it quickly became apparent that I was not going to last this way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter of my freshman year of college was when I finally broke. I remember getting off the phone with my parents and beginning to sense this growing discomfort in my chest. Soon, I was lying on the floor of my dorm, panic attack in full effect, taking big gasps of air, heart racing and wondering whether I was about to have a heart attack, my composed facade in shambles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what my first concern was as I laid in my bed recovering my breath, 20 minutes later?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m so glad nobody saw me like that.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Kian Karamdashti</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a young age, I was surrounded by toxic ideas about what it means to be a man. As an athlete, I was taught a lot of lessons on the field that translated to other contexts as well. Men are supposed to be aggressive; we’re supposed to take what we want, and under no circumstances should we show vulnerability or pain. I was (incorrectly) told that men are fundamentally and biologically different from women in both our desires and our behavior, and that this rationalized most of the violence we enacted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily for me, I had so many strong and compassionate women in my family that I never truly internalized these beliefs. I was basically raised in a matriarchy, and I knew from a young age that there was certainly no leadership role or job that a man can do that a woman can’t do (and most likely do better). My passion for anthropology inspired me to research and discover that most of what we think about sex and gender is actually not true, and that outdated stereotypes surrounding gender roles are based on patriarchal ideologies far more than on scientific fact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it took a lot of labor and arbitrary situations for me to become de-socialized and to grow up valuing empathy and vulnerability over traits we would consider more “masculine.” It shouldn’t be up to women to teach us this. Cisgender men created these toxic notions of masculinity, and it’s up to us to dismantle them. Recent events like mass shootings and the well-documented disparity in domestic violence perpetrated by men compared to women show that we have an issue with young men growing up entitled, ignorant, abrasive, and de-sensitized. It’s so easy in this day and age for men to dehumanize and demonize women personally or through social media, and it’s just not right. We must change ourselves in order to create the world that all women deserve.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Omar Hernandez</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic masculinity, in my (ill-informed) opinion, is a Rolodex of traits that every man shouldn’t emulate. Regardless of your standing knowledge of the word, it feels as if it is always within earshot. A buzzword, really. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I’ve known about toxic masculinity since high school, its relevance did not emerge until I moved to college — at the other end of the nation. My personal opinions are not matter-of-fact, but I do believe the atmosphere at UC Santa Barbara takes this phrase more seriously than in Buffalo, my hometown. And this makes sense — Southern California is a melting pot for social justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, toxic masculinity isn’t a term that I would use, ever. Its scope is too large, like shielding a pebble from the rain with an umbrella. Telling someone or saying that something is of toxic masculinity helps nobody; that’s stating the obvious. If you really want to make a difference, assess the issue individually, use more precise descriptions and identify the specific root of those actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I do believe that men throughout the world should be held accountable for their actions, the use of this label ultimately highlights the actions of the lower denominations in male society and presents a skewed image of males as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn’t fair. Take your “men ain’t shit” tweets somewhere else. For every asshole out there, another man is working just as hard to support himself and potentially a significant other and family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get lazy and paint the entire picture with just one color: generalizing the actions of men is unjust!</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Max Abrams</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion of toxic masculinity is one that cannot wait — men need to do their part. When one adheres and conforms to the traditional constructions of what manhood is, the consequences can have hegemonic and dangerous implications for oneself and others. These constructions of masculinity are, unfortunately, imposed upon and expected of boys beginning in childhood. Equally unfortunate are the consequences for those who do not act according to a specific template of gendered norms, which historically have been characterized by dominance, assertiveness and self-reliance. These behaviors can lead to more dangerous outcomes, such as misogyny, homophobia or violence. If a man does not adhere to these behaviors, it can lead to exclusion and ridicule from others, further perpetuating the behaviors in a cycle of desired sociocultural validation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By addressing toxic masculinity, we can work to dismantle the harmful behaviors that have been essentialized to construct what constitutes a “man.” Fighting these destructive norms does not subtract from “manhood,” but, rather, subverts repressive notions of gender and upholds fundamental tenets of how one should treat others.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have always had an effeminate voice, though I have not always known it. I always assumed I had a normal boy voice, just like all the other boys, so why wouldn’t I? It was not until I changed schools when I was about 10 that I was confronted with my “offensive sound.” On the first day, a group of boys introduced themselves to me </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">obviously the cool ones I should aspire to hang around. When I began to speak, they all chuckled and said, “Is that your normal voice?” I was stunned because of course it was and replied as such, which was met with guffaws and “you sound like a girl.” Needless to say, my relationship with said boys did not end well, and going forward I strictly maintained friendships with girls in order to limit my newfound insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88541\" style=\"width: 413px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88541\" data-attachment-id=\"88541\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/students-speak-out-on-toxic-masculinity/masc-miguel/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?fit=650%2C1055&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,1055\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"masc miguel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?fit=154%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?fit=631%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-88541\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?resize=403%2C654\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"654\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hi, I am a guy. I’m short and fat, with fingers that resemble sausages. I’m not into sports, I’ve never been a fan of cars and I think beer tastes like wet bread. I’ve been told many times that I’m not a man because of these facts and I’ve been ridiculed because I’m not six-foot-plus with rippling muscles and a deep voice. It hurts, especially during the chaotic swirl that was high school. Feeling like I wasn’t what I was supposed to be and that I couldn’t do anything about it shredded my self-esteem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe to them I wasn’t a man. I am, however, a woodworker and a blacksmith. A lumberjack and a powerlifter. I can fix any problem that comes up in your house and I can build a house from the ground up. I bring smiles to the people around me and support to my loved ones. I can cook one hell of a dinner, I clean a house damn well and I know how to ask for help when I need it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic masculinity showed me what I wasn’t and tried to shame me for it. Instead, I turned around and found what real men are made of.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Miguel Rodriguez</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My life, from childhood to the present, has been rooted in ever-changing ideologies of masculinity. My upbringing was consistent with typical ideas of what it means to be a “man.” Lessons from my dad, an individual heavily indoctrinated with a hegemonic understanding of masculinity, served as an introduction. While he craved hunting trips and sports, I craved wearing dresses, carefully braiding my mom’s hair on days when he was absent. The years passed by, and as my voice grew deeper, my face hairier and my body larger, I felt myself internalizing his ideals and expectations, unaware of their impact. I became less empathetic and my words and actions danced with destruction. Not only had I absorbed my dad’s ideals, rooted in toxic masculinity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I embodied them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I grew older my mind became weary, my clandestine relationship with queerness yearning to express itself outwardly. Anxiously, I began distancing myself from my father and the many ideas that I had come to believe. This space allowed for a transformation; the expectations imposed by him melted away as I gained other perspectives. Experiences that broke down gender dichotomies and heteronormativity provided understandings previously concealed by my upbringing. The self-hatred I’d harbored due to masculine ideals no longer dictated my behavior. I embraced my desire to cross boundaries — painting my nails the color of the sky, holding hands with boys without fear of ridicule, chasing desires I’d stored in a closet somewhere 300 miles away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I get older, my growth is no longer controlled by traditional notions of masculinity. The walls that my father, and countless other men in my life, aided me in building have lost their height and sturdiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had to become gentler with myself and my emotions, with the emotions of others, with the words that men often produce without understanding the impact they have on others. I’ve begun to accept my mind’s fragility and how it influences my interactions with the earth and those that exist upon it. As I become aware of my errors, I feel the need for myself and all men to be constantly aware of the pain they may cause to others, as well as the pain they may cause to themselves.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Dallin Mello</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masculinity is an interesting concept we have the opportunity to observe in today’s cosmopolitan social sphere. It’s important to acknowledge that masculinity, while sometimes toxic, annoying and inconsiderate, can also be a beautiful thing. I believe that masculinity, or typical male behavior, is something that takes a long time to master. As a college-aged student, I recognize that I still have a lot to learn. To complicate things, our society is learning with us. Growing up, masculinity meant being a gentleman: holding doors open for ladies (and sometimes men), being tough and striving for success. But as I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that, like most things, masculinity is a balance. The beautiful thing about masculinity today is that you can paint your nails, talk about your feelings and still get laid. Masculinity is what you make of it. So please don’t make it toxic.

This is not high school, people. We don’t have classes with the same people five days a week, we do not have the same dependence on finding a group of people to eat lunch with and, thank god, we are not stuck in the same place for seven hours of our day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we have freedom. And not only does this mean being able to choose where we eat lunch and what classes we take, but it also means choosing who we spend our time with. This means that friendships are not obligatory, and we can find people who truly make us feel happy and fulfilled.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students need to become better at self-care in terms of determining which friendships are actually healthy.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am not saying that this task is easy. In the complicated social life of college, your friends are usually connected to your other friends to create a complex web of people you know, but do not always like. So, trying to get rid of a toxic friend that sits within a group of people you generally like is almost impossible. And I am not saying that I have all the solutions to these types of awkward situations; what I am saying is that it is important to recognize people in your life that repeatedly annoy and drain you. This doesn’t mean they are inherently horrible people — you just don’t want them in your house constantly, eating your beloved Ben &amp; Jerry’s The Tonight Dough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have had a series of epiphanies this quarter especially. I have reached the end of the honeymoon phase where everyone is nice, funny and a great friend. Some people are just friends more so out of obligation or for convenience, as we just don’t click with everybody. The same goes for friends in high school as well. At UCSB, I have learned what I want in my friends and the people I surround myself with. In high school, friends were more handed to us through similar activities and classes, but here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a difference between loving your friends for their faults and tolerating a toxic friendship because we are too nice or too lazy to express our feelings. Loving your friends for who they are should not translate to making you feel degraded or hurt constantly, but rather means appreciating the diversity amongst friends. This does not mean we should berid anyone that seems slightly irritating, as some of my best friends are individuals who I did not originally click with. However, that only means that active communication is even more important, so both friends understand each other and their wishes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of us, it can be easier to recognize these qualities within romantic partners. Of course, this does not always mean that a break-up is clean, as sometimes even the most disgusting of partners tend to stick around, whether we like it or not. However, just like how our friends would tell us to break up with a person who is treating us poorly, I am also saying that this break-up, although messy and stressful, can also happen with friends, whether we’ve known them for 10 years or 10 months. At the same time, it is also important to understand that people are capable of change, and sometimes communicating your feelings is the most important step toward mending a broken friendship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking care of others can often be easier than taking care of ourselves. We make excuses for them and tell ourselves that they aren’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bad, that they’ll get better, but then five years later, they’re still eating The Tonight Dough out of your fridge while you glare at them from across the living room. But, as adults now trying to navigate through the complex social scene of UCSB, it is important for us to prioritize our own lives and search for meaningful friendships that make us feel </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happy.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We do not have to put up with people who make us feel like shit or people who never put in any effort. We are adults, and it’s time we start having friendships with people who are adult enough to be good friends too. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Wiley is a first year who emphasizes the importance of finding and maintaining genuine friendships within the complex social scene of college. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bdf73e8bd5e8251c5cdf749f032f20a2?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bdf73e8bd5e8251c5cdf749f032f20a2?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/grace-wiley/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Grace Wiley</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Grace Wiley is a Global Studies and Spanish double major who is incredibly excited to be writing for the Opinion section of the Daily Nexus!</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:gracewiley@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/toxic-friends-no-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/toxic-friends-no-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/toxic-friends-no-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/toxic-friends-no-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/toxic-friends-no-more/","id":6409,"author":{"id":796,"name":"Grace Wiley"},"related":[6408,6407,6406],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Coping with Divorce in College","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dndivorce-01-e1556777613865.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dndivorce-01-e1556777613865.png?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Paige Holloway explores the lasting effects of divorce on college-aged children.

I personally never had to face the hardships involved with splitting time between two different households or deciding where to celebrate holidays when I was a kid. Both my sister and I were lucky enough to have had a completely secure upbringing with little worries or concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet there are so many people my age that did not have these same comforts growing up, and I recall being a kid in elementary school and thinking it was really sad that some of my friends’ parents weren’t together. I would watch them pack their school backpacks with miscellaneous overnight things in order to go from dad’s house in the morning to mom’s house after dance practice. What I failed to grasp at that age was how strong these other kids were becoming as they coped with a less comfortable or stable childhood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lillian Cheeks, a second-year student at UCSB, had to learn independence at a young age when her dad moved out of their house. While speaking about growing up with a single parent, she said, “I learned to be insanely self-sufficient and make decisions for myself at a young age because I had no other choice. At times I felt like I was partly raising myself because my mom had to work extra shifts, meaning I was alone most of the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, kids who grow up with married parents become reliant on their family for most everyday tasks and learn self-reliance later in life. Many other students, like Lillian, had to maneuver through childhood without a secure family bond and were pushed to grow up before they were ready. As difficult as this must have been on her childhood experience, Lillian still acknowledges that this experience shaped her into the capable student and person she is today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to college already very independent and knew how to make decisions for myself,” Lillian said. Being thrown into college and adjusting to life on your own is a scary process for most, but Lillian’s past made her more comfortable in adjusting to adult life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephanie Silveria, another second-year student here at UCSB, also feels that the trauma of watching her parents’ divorce play out when she was a little girl helped shape her into the compassionate person she is today. She claims, “it has made me more tolerant and understanding with people and situations.” For this reason, she further expressed that even with all the hurt and pain she has experienced, she wouldn’t change the way things occurred even if she was given the option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some degree, I almost envy the people whose parents got divorced when they were young because it may have appeared completely normal when they were children. At a young age, there is a better chance of the child becoming accustomed to a new familial lifestyle and those adjustments can shape the individual into a strong, capable adult later in life.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was 16,  my parents dropped a completely unexpected bomb: they were getting a divorce. I was old enough to realize that the family dynamic I had known thus far would forever change. My age </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">along with the naivety I carried up until that point about happy families </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have made it even more difficult to cope with the divorce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Sydney Fishback, a third-year student at UCSB who was only 11 months old when her parents got divorced, discussed how she sympathizes with my experience. She expressed that it would have been much harder if she was older like I was when everything happened. “It would be harder because I would’ve been conditioned to seeing my parents together and used to knowing what it’s like to live with them both,” she noted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was perhaps one of the hardest things for me to adjust to. Today, I still struggle when people ask me if I’ll be going home for breaks. I have been forced to choose whether to visit my dad, who lives much closer now that he moved to SoCal last year, or to return to NorCal to my childhood home that I grew up in to see my mom. It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Complicated” is the best way to describe my life since my parents got divorced later in my life. Being in college and having to discover ways to see my parents, who live seven hours apart, has not been easy in the slightest. Whenever I become frustrated with my situation, it’s helpful to think about how lucky I was to have grown up with happy parents and that many other kids my age didn’t have this luxury. Although their marriage ended, I still have the memories that other people my age with divorced parents lack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether someone’s parents split up when they were a child or a teenager, there are bound to be both hardships and positives in each situation. It’s okay to have trouble with it at times. Whenever I need a breath, I take it. Taking a moment to realize that having an imperfect family situation is only making me stronger as an individual is the peace of mind that gets me through the worst of it. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paige Holloway embraces the </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">difficulties of a nontraditional family structure. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae1996f9eafccabb0eb58d599ab3e649?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae1996f9eafccabb0eb58d599ab3e649?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/paige-holloway/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Paige Holloway</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Paige Holloway is a Communication and Sociology major as well a write and assistant editor for On the Menu.

I’m not sure why this change began, but I can only imagine it manifested from the mental health challenges I was encountering at the time. Toward the end of my senior year, I was stuck in a full-fledged spiral of self-doubt and negativity, and I couldn’t seem to find my way out. It was also around this time that I learned about</span><a href=\"https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> growth mindsets and fixed mindsets. </span></a></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2006, a psychologist named Carol Dweck published a book called </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/business/06unbox.html\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mindset: the New Psychology of Success</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The book was the culmination of her research on fixed and growth mindsets. The idea is that someone with a growth mindset believes that their intelligence and skill can improve over time and with experience, while in contrast, someone with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence and skills are fixed traits that cannot change. These beliefs are underlying, but they nonetheless dictate a lot about how we learn — Dweck’s research has shown that people with growth mindsets find more success and satisfaction in learning than those with a fixed mindset. But while this concept mainly focuses on the way we learn, Dweck also suggests that our mindsets can have a huge impact on other aspects of our lives as well, whether that be academic, professional or personal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was learning about this research and the different kinds of mindsets, I began to recognize myself as a “fixed” thinker, but I also noticed that I wasn’t always like this. I remembered when I was younger and eager to pick myself up each time I fell down, and whether it was in the classroom or the studio, I wasn’t afraid to make mistakes. Somewhere between tutus and teendom, I lost my capability to bounce back from perceived failures. After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change. But the question remained: how? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fixed mindset made my first year of college very difficult. I found myself often discouraged and simply giving up academically. I took a math class in the winter of my freshman year, and no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to overcome the overwhelming thought that I wasn’t good at math and never could be. I let the homework pile up and the self-doubt devour me. Remember: One of the identifying characteristics of someone with a fixed mindset is the belief that their baseline intelligence can’t be changed, and I was a textbook example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearing the end of my first year, I was rapidly losing confidence in who I could be academically and artistically. It wasn’t until the next fall that I had my lightbulb moment. One morning I went to my dramatic writing professor’s office hours to tell her I was excited to write but I was worried that I sucked, and she said something along the lines of “everyone sucks until they don’t.” It took me a while to warm up to the idea, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it’s OK to suck; in fact, everyone sucks at some point, and especially at the beginning. In that class, I delved into the world of podcasts about writing and books on dramatic writing, and I discovered three fundamental truths: 1) first drafts always suck, 2) you will face a lot of rejection, 3) the only way to be a good writer is to write. Learning these things through the lens of writing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something I love and am </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sensitive about </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made me realize that they apply to everything.

That’s not to say that some people don’t have natural proclivities toward certain subjects; of course, some people are born with arches that are perfect for pointe shoes or a natural sense of rhythm in their writing.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with those proclivities, it takes work to be great.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s OK to suck, and skills and intelligence are not stagnant </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we can always find ways to improve and grow. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, my mindset hasn’t changed overnight, and there are many days when I feel like I’ll never be a great writer or that my arabesque will never get higher. But in those times I have to remind myself that it’s OK to suck, and skills and intelligence are not stagnant </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we can always find ways to improve and grow. The best advice I can give to anyone struggling to motivate or believe in themselves is to welcome criticism and failure, because it can only make you more resilient. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants her fellow Gauchos to be fearless in the face of sucking and to grow from their failures.</span></i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.
