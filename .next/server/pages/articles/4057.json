It also alleged that the UC went outside of the collective bargaining agreement with UAW by firing teaching assistants for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every member of the union will soon have the chance to democratically vote on whether or not we can hold a strike. If approved, this action would be statewide, and could affect every department at the University of California,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar said in a press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the COLA movement grows across the UC, graduate students have emphasized that their actions are a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract, which was negotiated by UAW in 2018 and expires in 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\">wrote</a> on Feb. 14 to UCSC faculty that the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) would not “re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side-letter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 24, the UC Regents filed an <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\">Unfair Practice Charge</a> against UAW. Since the UC system is a public institution, all labor disputes go through PERB when one party in a state labor contract alleges another of unfair practice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents allege that UAW “condoned, supported, encouraged, and failed to take affirmative action to end, unlawful concerted activity in violation of the parties’ No Strikes clause,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Unfair Practice Charge will be decided by PERB in a public hearing if the charges are not settled beforehand. A hearing date has not been set, according to UAW statewide Trustee and doctoral history student Andrew Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents are requesting that PERB issue multiple orders of action against UAW: one declaring the work stoppages at UCSC and all other UC campuses an illegal strike, and another order for UAW to refrain from engaging in any strikes, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents are also requesting that PERB seek an injunction to prevent Academic Student Employees (ASE) — which includes teaching assistants, tutors and readers — and UAW from engaging in strikes and “any other relief the Board deems just and proper,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two orders both restrict current strikes, if enacted, the injunction would give the UC the authority to forcibly shut down strikes with police at all UC campuses, according to Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UC Regents’ unfair practice charge, UAW filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges on Feb. 28 and March 2 against the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\">first set</a> of charges allege that the UC refused to negotiate a COLA with UAW, while at the same time bargaining directly with individuals and university-funded student organizations, which don’t have the legal authority to bargain with the UC, according to a UAW press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear that UC wants to create an appearance that it is respecting graduate student employees while avoiding true bargaining, where the law requires the parties to stand with equal footing and to act in good faith,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no current bargaining between graduate students and UCOP, Napolitano published a statement on Feb. 21 saying that she would meet with the UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) to discuss a variety of issues including “cost of living.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC then published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/ucgpc-says-it-will-not-meet-with-napolitano-to-discuss-a-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">statement</a> clarifying that the meeting was not in response to COLA, and that the timing and wording of Napolitano’s statement caused a misunderstanding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charges also referenced the offer UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive extended to striking graduate students, which included guaranteed five-year packages for Ph.D. students and two-year packages for M.A. students, along with a $2,500 annual housing supplement for graduate students who submitted fall quarter grades and stopped striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\">second set</a> of Unfair Practice Charges, filed on March 2, allege that the UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\">dismissing</a> UCSC TAs from spring quarter appointments for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades; according to the charges, the UC “denies these workers their statutory right to union representation and is intended to bypass the union.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These charges led to the UAW Bargaining Team’s vote on March 3, paving the way for a full UAW vote of whether or not to hold a labor practice strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have been calling for the University to come to the table and negotiate a Cost of Living Adjustment for months now. And it is not true that UC can’t reopen the contract that was ratified in 2018. It’s that they won’t. We ask them every day to open the contract and negotiate a</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COLA4ALL?src=hashtag_click\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> #COLA4ALL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

It also calls on UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang to “email UCSC administration and the UC Office of the President denouncing the threats to terminate wildcat strikers and request[s] that UCOP opens negotiations on a COLA for graduate students at all UC campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said in an interview with the Nexus that she feels that the needs of graduate students are sometimes left out in the greater conversation of student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of times on undergraduate UC campuses, a lot of the emphasis is on undergraduate students and resources for them,” she said. “But I think a lot of times, people forget about graduate students and TAs and it’s not as big of a topic, not only on UC campuses, but nationwide.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos, who first learned about the COLA movement after one of her TAs “took the time to educate us on the issue” by holding her class’s section at the 16-hour-long Cheadle Hall </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sit-in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Friday, said “it’s insane that [a COLA is] a fight that our grad students have to go through because we feel so blessed to be at this institution, but so many people are struggling to make things stay afloat.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m a student who solely relies on financial aid through UCSB, as well as whatever FAFSA is able to provide me. So I’m just trying to fathom how I would barely be able to scrape by and have a healthy living situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond giving graduate students support from the resolution, White said that Associated Students (A.S.) also paid to reserve Corwin Pavilion for the COLA General Assembly meeting on Monday, where graduate students voted to begin striking on Thursday. In addition, Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi said during Senate that the Internal Vice President’s Office will “fund COLA for up to $1,000 for supplies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, a student sponsor on the resolution, was outspoken about the Senate’s lack of engagement with not just the COLA movement but with student activism this year, slamming his fellow senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People continuously come up to me, asking me, ‘Where are the elected representatives that we supposedly look up to?’ With the COLA movement going on, it’s not just enough for a couple of us to be showing up,” Segura said to the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White, who both confirmed they will be present at Thursday’s wildcat strike alongside graduate students, emphasized the need for undergraduate support as a pipeline to create awareness about this issue and to rally the student body to support a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the strike at Santa Cruz started, they did not have a lot of grad students striking. They didn’t have any documentation of faculty support or undergraduate support. I think a really cool part about our [COLA] movement is that we’ve already started to document all this undergraduate and faculty support,” White said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And I think it’s going to be really helpful moving forward in our dealings with administration,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White also made note that although the lifestyles and responsibilities of graduate students are different from those of their undergraduate student counterparts, they are not mutually exclusive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their living conditions are our learning conditions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

While on strike, UCSB graduate students who work as teaching assistants will withhold Winter 2020 grades and will not hold any sections or do any work unrelated to their own degrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large number of graduate students, undergraduates and faculty returned for the second day of the strike, with upwards of 300 showing up for day two of the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s graduate students are from the second campus within the UC system to go on strike in the fight for a COLA; UC Santa Cruz graduate students are on their 13th day on the picket line, and UC Davis recently announced that they will be withholding grades starting yesterday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every UC campus — except for UC San Francisco — has taken some form of organizing action for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike at UCSB began at 8 a.m. and continued until 5 p.m., with a rally at noon where close to 1,600 people filled the Storke Tower lawn. The crowd heard from various organizers, faculty and undergraduates before marching across bike lanes, through the Arbor and to the Mosher Alumni House parking lot. On the way back to Storke Tower, a crowd formed a circle around the University Library, continuing to chant while other speakers spoke.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Fujino, a professor and interim chair in the department of Asian American studies, said to the crowd at the rally that the university needs to be more seriously addressing COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the Thomas Fires hit, this university took extraordinary measures — finals were moved to another quarter. This, I say, is an extraordinary moment. Graduate students on average spend over 50% of their income on rent. This is untenable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate Student Association (GSA) President Cierra Sorin said that the high turnout for the first day of the strike was unexpected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not gonna lie, I was scared getting up this morning. I didn’t sleep a whole lot last night; this is a big thing that we’re doing. But people came through,” Sorin said. “Every constituency on campus, I think, came through today, especially the undergrads — there were hundreds of undergrads that came out. I’m in awe.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday morning began with approximately 20 people, but by 11 a.m., that number grew to over 100, which grew to over 1,000 by noon. A large part of that crowd included undergraduates and faculty who stood in solidarity with graduate students throughout the day; more than 50 S.T.E.M. students also had their own separate march from the Chemistry Lawn before merging into the larger rally at Storke Tower. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, about 80 faculty members across different departments — all wearing black and several wearing graduation regalia — met at Cheadle Hall and delivered their own demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, emphasizing that they believe there should be no retaliation against students or faculty for participating in COLA organizing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History professor Ann Marie Plane, who was one of the professors that delivered the demands, said in an interview that it was a “cordial meeting” but noted that administration and graduate students may have a hard time coming to an agreement over a COLA without “significant intervention, either by the university administration in Oakland, and/or the state legislature coming up with more funds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t recruit top quality graduate students without some kind of augmentation. Absolutely we’re going to lose students, lose the international quality and character of the institution,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the meeting, Marshall said “it would be most appropriate to take this struggle to Sacramento,” referring to the California legislature, since he estimates it would be around $40 to $50 million to meet UCSB’s COLA estimates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marshall added that because the strike is happening without the authorization of the graduate student union, United Auto Workers Union 2865, it is the “official line of the Office of the President” that it is “illegal for the university to negotiate with the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local political leaders also stood in solidarity with graduate students during the strike, including Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who is running for re-election, and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, who is running for State Assembly. Karen Jones, who is running against Hartmann for the supervisor seat, also came later in the day in support of COLA and to speak with COLA organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carlos Cruz, a second-year history doctoral student at UCSC who has continued to withhold his classes’ fall quarter grades, came down to Santa Barbara to speak at the strike, emphasizing the importance of UC-wide action in order to get a UC-wide response from UC President Janet Napolitano. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much what it comes down to is, what does solidarity mean? What does solidarity look like? If we’re going to change anything, we have to engage in solidarity,” Cruz said. “Not through the power of institutions, [but through] the power of ourselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the strike continues into next week, Sorin said COLA organizers plan to have more activities during the day, such as teach-ins and lectures about the history of activism and legal observation training as well as social activities, including board games and dance parties. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin said that the UCSB COLA movement is looking to capitalize on the large crowds that showed up for Thursday’s rally and turn that into a deeper involvement with the movement as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re having more folks come to us hour by hour being like, ‘What can we do to help, how can I get involved?’ We’re getting people self-assigned to sub-committees, having people continue to show up to meetings,” Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson Guilfoil and Holly Rusch contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
