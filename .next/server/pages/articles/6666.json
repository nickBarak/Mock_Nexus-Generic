Tyler’s rise to stardom happened both gradually and all at once. The rapper was headlining shows at the age of 18 and hasn’t stopped climbing through the ranks of the art world since. Now, Tyler has Grammy nominations, radio play time, a Vice series and multiple Adult Swim shows under his belt. Last Friday, the artist sat down with Terence Keel of UCSB’s History and Black Studies Departments to discuss his craft in a conversation organized by A.S. Program Board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the doors opened, attendees ran, not walked, into the empty rows of seats that inhabit Campbell Hall as a playlist full of King Krule and N.E.R.D played in the background. At 8 p.m., Keel took the stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not here to talk to me. We’re here to have a conversation with one of the most creative geniuses of your generation, Tyler, The Creator,” he said. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After an expositional summarization of the artist’s career, Keel introduced Tyler to the stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Wassup,” Tyler muttered as he was met with a wave of enthusiastic applause. “Imma be honest, I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing here. I legit don’t know what I’m about to talk about, but I had nothing else to do so I agreed to do this shit.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the moment Tyler stepped onto the stage, he grasped the full attention of the anxiously adrenalized audience. Dressed in an outfit he deemed similar to that of a “fucking Nigerian immigrant,” Tyler sat with his linen-cloaked legs criss-crossed on the loveseat resting at center stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel began by wishing Tyler a happy belated birthday. And, as one would expect, profanities flowed ubiquitously from the rapper’s speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Oh stop, birthdays are fucking stupid,” Tyler replied. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion commenced awkwardly — it took some time for Tyler to seem like he was comfortable with the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task of interviewing Tyler appears daunting from the outside. Any slip up was promptly brought to the attention of the hundreds of college students in attendance. Tyler was not afraid to explicitly criticize the interviewer, members of the audience or even the event itself throughout the duration of the evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel once referred to Tyler’s recent album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flower Boy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flower Child” </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in a question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience fell silent for a brief moment until Tyler interrupted Keel’s question with a raspy chuckle, exclaiming, “N*gga, you crazy!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel responded, “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flower Boy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I’m sorry.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd reciprocated with laughter as Tyler continued to tease Keel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This n*gga said it with so much confidence,” he joked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel rolled with the punches, although, laughing along with the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there’s something you need in the presence of Tyler, it’s thick skin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two discussed Tyler’s recent tour with Vince Staples. Keel asked him how this latest tour has compared to early Odd Future tours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The bus is clean,” Tyler noted. “It don’t smell like backwoods and dick.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist explained the progression of his live concerts and the process of improving his stage production and performance quality with each show. He said he began making alternate versions of particular songs for his tour dates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel asked Tyler when he knew he was going to be a star, to which the rapper remarked, “Oh man, I always knew I was gonna be a star,” the audience laughed. “My kindergarten graduation, I hosted it. Seriously, it was fuckin’ tight.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler explained that he was always an annoying class clown, but that he was also into music since a young age, laying the foundation for an ever-expanding infatuation with sound. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist later commented on the routineness of everyday life and the cyclical comfortability of becoming weighed down by monotonous tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You go to school. You graduate, what, 22? You have a diploma. You either get a job or use your diploma and become an intern or something, and something works out. Then, oh, cool, you have a cool job. Then you meet someone … Fuck it, we’re getting old, let’s fuck and get married,” he said. “Then you turn 43 and you’ve got a little bread and then, fuck, I missed out on my youth. And that’s when you see older dudes buying Harley Davidsons.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81977\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1912194182\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81972\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81977\" data-attachment-id=\"81977\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-13/tyler-the-creator-gets-honest-with-ucsb/tylerex1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TylerEX1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81977\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TylerEX1.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81977\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jorge Olazaba</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel began asking another question, but Tyler was turned around, staring at the large, projected Petra Collins portrait of himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel paused and Tyler said, “That is a gorgeous n*gga, bro!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interview then resumed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keel asked Tyler how his Viceland show “Nuts and Bolts” came to fruition, and Tyler commented, “I was supposed to do an interview with a Klan member in 2015.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, a Ku Klux Klan member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler said he wanted to talk with the man about his interests, like what music and movies he’s into. The interview didn’t work out, however, so Tyler just spoke on film about the last music video he made. The end product of this video was called “Nuts and Bolts.” After three more videos under that moniker, Tyler and his team decided to propose it as an actual television show, and thus, Tyler landed a series on Vice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his last question, Keel asked Tyler what advice he has to offer to those in attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I mean, that question is, like, next level vague, dude,” Tyler responded.

Having influences in music, art and fashion. Did you intend on building this empire from the start? Or were you just going for the ride?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler replied, “Both.” He explained that his diminutive attention span is what ultimately led him to have influence in so many creative spaces. He’ll be working on something and see another thing he’s interested in so he’ll drop everything to go pursue that new thing. With time, Tyler ended up with a number of passions that he has explored over the course of his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler then asked Gonzalez how his day was, and then asked Gonzalez to also ask him how his day was, at which point the rapper dove into a four-minute rant about an unsatisfactory customer service experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This rant eventually ended with Tyler screaming, “Respect me, bitch!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rapper let several more attendees ask him questions following the pre-selected students. In all, Tyler ended up fielding over a dozen questions from students in attendance, making the Q&amp;A period just as long as his interview with Keel. The artist even stayed on stage afterward to meet fans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler has a distinct ability to articulate his thoughts in a simple and direct fashion. His insight often comes off as comedic in nature, but there is certainly a wealth of meaning to what he has to say. There’s something unique about simultaneously entertaining a crowd and elucidating knowledge in a live, extemporaneous setting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of things to be learned from Tyler, The Creator’s discussion with Terence Keel, but one thing is for certain: Tyler subscribes to no labels. He’s not an anarchist, he’s not an anti-popstar and he’s not a polymath — he’s Tyler.</span></p>\n<p><em>All art featured in this article is courtesy of Jorge Olazaba, @artoffilth on Instagram.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

As we age, the number of obstacles we face increases (as does our frustration), so we cope through any outlet we see fit. There are a variety of ways to go about this, but most people choose to turn to music. The alluring comfort that comes with being able to find yourself in a song and letting it wash your troubles away is the reason I listen to music, and is a feeling bands like Blink-182 have mastered the art of creating.</p>\n<p>Blink-182 initially formed in Poway, California in 1992, but went into hiatus in 2005 after the departure of guitarist Tom DeLonge. The band rejoined forces in 2009, releasing their sixth album <em>Neighborhoods</em> two years later. However, DeLonge quit once again and was replaced by the band’s current guitarist/vocalist, Matt Skiba. With the recent release of their newest album <em>California</em>, Blink-182 embarked on a long-awaited tour across the country and will be bringing their adolescence-inspired pop-punk anthems to Santa Barbara Bowl Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>One would expect the band to have shifted their sound completely after making music for so long and going through several changes, but it is evident how much effort has gone into staying true to the core of their signature sound. <em>California</em> is nearly flawless when it comes to embodying the evolution of Blink-182’s sound, yet highlights the band’s fingerprint in each track, signaling “we’re still the same old band.” It includes angst-filled tales and anthems like “Bored to Death” and “Sober” that parallel with classic songs like “First Date” and “All the Small Things.” However, Blink does not neglect to appeal to the heart in a soulful ode to their home state, titled “California.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pop-punk mainstays A Day to Remember and All-American Rejects will both be sharing the stage with Blink-182. All three acts have been in the genre for quite some time, so it is seemingly inevitable to come across one of their songs. If you grew up in the mid-2000s like me, then songs like “I Miss You” and “It Ends Tonight” are included in the soundtrack of your childhood. It goes without saying that if you’re punk and you’re proud, this is a show you will not want to miss.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>From its inception in 2012, Día de los Muertos at the Santa Barbara Bowl has been a jubilant and exciting celebration of local culture. Featuring theatre performances, art installations, dance groups, altars to remember our loved ones lost and live music (like last year’s incredible sets by Bomba Esteréo and Chicano Batman), the Day of the Dead celebration seemed perfectly whole, in need of no further improvement.</p>\n<p>And then they booked Morrissey.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 4, Moz himself will be performing at the Bowl, with support by the Mexican Institute of Sound and Rubén Albarrán. Pay attention on that Friday night, because chances are the streets of Santa Barbara are about to get both a lot more sincere and a little more sexually ambiguous. Here, Morrissey will be kicking off an international tour, immediately following his headlining appearance at Chicago’s Riot Fest.  He most recently released the <em>World Peace is None of Your Business</em> LP on Harvest Records, receiving a solid reception from critics and charting highly in both the U.K. and U.S.</p>\n<p>The Irish-English indie rock crooner has always had an incredibly strong fan base within the Chicano community, but is that really so strange? Morrissey’s songwriting style in many ways parallels traditional Mexican music genres such as <em>ranchero</em>; both are often intensely personal expressions about love, and they tackle issues of national identity as well. The notion of otherness, of continuously feeling like an outsider, also pervades Morrissey’s work in a way many Mexican-Americans find highly relatable. The sense of split cultural identity is a familiar one, as some immigrants to areas like Southern California may feel like they completely belong neither here nor back in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Morrissey’s parents migrated to Manchester from Dublin a year before his birth, and many of his lyrics deal with his sense of identity as an immigrant as well as an Englishman.  In the first half of his career, Moz fought against the appropriation and twisting of British identity by Margaret Thatcher and the neoliberal administration in the U.K. of the 1980s. During this time he was the lead singer of indie rock band The Smiths, which some have praised as being the most influential rock group of all time. In his time with The Smiths, Morrissey acted as an anti-pop icon, creating a bookish, quiet persona in stark contrast to the pageantry and glam of other contemporary pop groups. He dressed in cardigans and National Health Service glasses, and wore his celibacy like a badge of honor. He was so uncool that cool stopped looking appealing.</p>\n<p>In addition to dozens of other accolades, Morrissey is also regarded as one of the best British lyricists of all time. “I am human and I need to be loved,” “You can pin and mount me like a butterfly,” “Why do I smile at people who I’d much rather kick in the eye?” I could literally do this all day. The crippling sincerity of his words is still unmatched in the musical canon (although Yo La Tengo, Cat Power and others have come close).</p>\n<p>Having attended last year, I can attest that Santa Barbara’s Dia de los Muertos celebration is a wild and freakish ride, and sure to be made all the more so by the appearance of the sweet and tender hooligan himself. Do you think about life and death and find that neither of them particularly appeals to you? Well, think about seeing the most morbid man on Earth at a death-themed holiday celebration. It just might.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-80448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of the Mallards</p></div>\n<p>Over the last few years, I’ve seen a number of Isla Vista bands come and go, and each year, it’s easy to see which ones are going to make the most impact. My freshman year, I covered the Olés for Artsweek a number of times, a band that played shows almost every weekend­­ — eventually bringing their sun-drenched brand of reggae to headlining concerts and festivals. Last year, I wrote about Savage Henry quite a bit, giving them both recognition and praise for their hazy, blues-tinged garage rock that they became known for. Members of these bands have graduated, and with their departure, they have made room for new acts to join our town’s music scene.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, we brought the Mallards into the <em>Nexus</em> office to play a session in the Batcave. They’re a four-piece originally formed three years ago by lead vocalist Matt Swiacki and vocalist Blake Berich. As fate would have it, they met in the freshman dorms after being randomly assigned to each other. Soon enough, they began playing together and found their individual voices as a duo. They didn’t officially form a full band until last year, when drummer Jake Morenc befriended the duo during a chess game and bassist Ray Muhlencamp joined a jam session.</p>\n<p>The Mallards have started making their way through the backyard show scene this year, and have been playing live ever since. Their ties to other Isla Vista acts are strong: Robert Sanlis of This is Napoleon? mixed, mastered and recorded their debut EP last summer. The group is extremely proud of the finished product, <em>Fowl Play</em>, which can be found on both Spotify and Apple Music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Isla Vista is a great place for a band to form, but sometimes finding space to practice becomes a challenge. We all share one square mile of land, so music travels incredibly far, especially since most spaces where a band could facilitate practice sessions are outside. The Mallards have been kicked out of eight places total because of noise complaints, including parking garages, dorms and even the marine science building on campus. However, the struggle to come together during the week is rewarded on Friday and Saturday nights when crowds gather to dance, party and listen to what they’ve created.</p>\n<p>Just like its wonderful name, Milk Drunk has crafted a carefree, punk aesthetic. Members Kellan Staninger, Ethan Jones and Aaron Kopperman met through frequenting shows in the area, as they share a love for the local DIY scene. Milk Drunk was officially formed last spring and has been working hard ever since.</p>\n<p>In addition to playing shows both on and off campus, the three piece already has two EPs on their Bandcamp page. It is clear that their sound is heavily informed by their influences, from Car Seat Headrest to the Story So Far — all big names in the indie world that have major influence over new acts. However, they don’t attempt to replicate these bands and instead aim to make a sound unique to both Isla Vista and the music world at large. Guitarist and vocalist Jones describes their sound as “post-ska, pre-country,” which is a label you’ll only understand if you listen for yourself.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80449\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1050951179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80447\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80449\" data-attachment-id=\"80449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/new-talent-isla-vista-bands-to-watch-in-2018/iv-bands-online-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Bands ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80449\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IV-Bands-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Mallards</p></div>\n<p>Considering the notorious emphasis on partying Isla Vista tends to have during weekends, sometimes the focus for showgoers is not the music itself. Because of this, Milk Drunk believes that many bands in Isla Vista make an attempt to play it safe in an effort to please everyone. Of course, it is difficult to keep the local DIY scene alive if all of the bands are aiming for a similar sound. However, Milk Drunk cites fellow Isla Vista band RabbitFoot as another band to see — the show that they put on is, in a word, unique.</p>\n<p>Lord BunNy, also known as Cris Sharma, is the vocalist and guitarist for RabbitFoot. He started the band with lead guitarist Malcom Coffman a couple of years ago, then bassist Ricardo Valenzuela-Morin joined and drummer Yarden Refaely followed. The band plays a self-described mix of “latin jazz, bossa nova, folk, alternative and punk,” which they also showcase on weekends during house party shows.</p>\n<p>RabbitFoot has had a number of shows shut down in Isla Vista, possibly due to the hard-hitting nature of their shows. They rebel against the tame nature of popular indie music, and like their peers, they are creating something different. Their energy comes at you quick, and can be a little strange — but in the best way possible.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, it is difficult to maintain a band and write original songs, all while working and taking multiple classes. Somehow, these guys do it all­­ — and play shows on the weekends, too.

Her newest song, “Apathy<em>,</em>” is riddled with personal, poetic lyrics. In an interview with Pitchfork, Cosmos disclosed that some lyrics in “Apathy” were written when Cosmos was on tour feeling crazy and wishing that she had a clear purpose that she was designed for. Though the song still maintains the reminiscent beachy L.A. sound conveyed in her earlier work, the track also possesses a more developed and mature nature making her track both a lyrical and melodic gem.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOzBMbQQNCY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Young Fathers, “Holy Ghost”</p>\n<p>A danceable cut off the Scottish rap trio’s latest studio album, “Holy Ghost” is packed with clever lyrics and explosive instrumentation from Young Fathers.

While the EP’s name, which translates to pervert in Japanese, makes Gibson seem like a symbolic and literal pervert, the composition of the EP makes Gibson appear godly. “Electric Life” has a particularly unique yet typecast sound; it’s inimitable and appealing enough to stand out to new listeners but nostalgic enough to quickly make it a fan favorite. His tracks never fail to impress; on top of lyrics with ridiculous flow, “Electric Life” furnishes an eerie atmosphere, creating a mesmerizing listen.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6-OTtMnaf0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Aubrey Huntsman, “Strawberry Season”</p>\n<p>Making her debut into the world of music, artist Aubrey Huntsman has recently released her three-song EP, <em>Dreams</em>, available on Spotify and Apple Music. The opening track, “Strawberry Season” stands apart from the other two as it captures the fuzzy feeling of falling in love and compares it to the beautiful warm weather one might experience during the spring and summertime. As the title of the EP suggests, this song is very dreamy; Huntsman has managed to create the perfect soft, synth hit that could make anyone want to fall in love and pick some strawberries.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.
