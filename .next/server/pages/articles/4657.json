The Commission made it a goal to better address the concerns of the public in the upcoming meeting, which will include a presentation by staff from the Santa Barbara County Planning and Development and Santa Barbara County Public Works to discuss proposed parking strategies mentioned in the Isla Vista Master Plan.</p>\n<p>Fifth District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Daniel Blough said he was doubtful of the survey results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know when they did the survey, but the information was not accurate,” Blough said.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year mathematics major Brent Roth, the parking situation in I.V. is not conducive to students or residents, and parking spots are too small and not secure.</p>\n<p>“The parking situation in Isla Vista is just terrible, I can’t stress that enough,” Roth said. “The biggest issue is space and ensuring that your car is safe.”<br>\nFourth-year environmental studies major Lino Martinez said he has not seen a recent increase in parking.</p>\n<p>“The increase in 15 percent doesn’t seem like it represents actually what is occurring,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>According to Second District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Cecilia Brown, the duty of the Planning Commission is to obtain accurate information regarding the current state of parking in I.V. with help from Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the meeting is to get current pertinent information about the parking situation and to get greater community input,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>Brown said she is glad there will be a meeting where the public can participate.</p>\n<p>“They need to participate, they need to come and tell the county what their experience is,” Brown said. “Their input is valuable.”</p>\n<p>County of SB Planning and Development Associate Planner Katie Hentrich said community input from the meeting this Monday will be discussed at the next Committee meeting.</p>\n<p>“The County is seeking feedback on the proposed parking strategies to survey parking availability,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said both the Planning and Development and the Public Work staff will present various solutions to the parking situation in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The proposed parking strategies include an on-street parking monitoring and reporting system to assess on-street parking capacity and vacancy rates in the community,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>If available parking is found to be below an increase of 15 percent then more surveys will be taken to find new strategies such as a permit system, according to Hentrich.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, if data results indicate vacancy rates remain low, a permit parking program would be implemented,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said she encourages community members to attend the meeting.</p>\n<p>“This meeting is a good opportunity for permanent residents and students to participate in the planning process,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Long-term residents, students and university and county officials voiced I.V. is at a critical turning point with many projects underway to improve safety and stability, and Plastino’s continued presence in I.V. would benefit the community.</p>\n<p>While the practice of the Sheriff’s department is to rotate IVFP leadership approximately every two years, individuals throughout I.V. believe Plastino’s role in projects such as training the recently appointed Community Resource Deputy (CRD) James McKarrell and preparing for the upcoming events of Halloween in the fall is important enough to lengthen the lieutenant’s term by a year or two.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he met with Sheriff Brown on Sept. 21, during which time the topic of an extension was discussed.</p>\n<p>“He expressed that he was not yet certain about how long I would remain in IV, although I think we all expect my assignment here to last at least through mid-April,” Plastino said in an email. “If I’m able to stay at least until April, I will be happy with that.  It was possible for me to move this past summer, so any additional time in IV is much appreciated.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said if he is replaced in April, he hopes he can provide input on a replacement for his position and spend time training the new lieutenant to ensure a smooth transition. Within IVFP, there is one patrol sergeant who could be promoted to lieutenant; otherwise Plastino’s replacement would come from a county-wide pool of current and future lieutenants, according to Plastino.</p>\n<p>“I do have a couple in mind that would do well here. I think personality and a desire to work with our very diverse population are very key criteria for any law enforcement manager in IV,” Plastino said in an email. “This also requires someone that is open to new ideas and is willing to break away from the standard models of policing.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is both humbled by the community’s request that he remain in I.V. and grateful they value his role in the community.<br>\n“They are all people and organizations that care about our town and spend so much of their time to make this place wonderful.   I am truly touched that they would want me to stay and help them,” Plastino said in an email.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The main message in the video ad centers on the letters “I.V.” and encourages viewers to keep I.V. safe by giving back to the community and living a life that makes you proud. The ad will be broadcasted on television in Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, Oxnard and San Luis Obispo County and also shared through social media.</p>\n<p>UCSB, SBCC and the city of Goleta each contributed $15,000 for the campaign and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office and the sheriff’s department each donated $5,000. I.V. Safe is comprised of government stakeholders and receives $10,000 annually in funding from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County District Attorney and chair of I.V. Safe Joyce Dudley said the committee’s top priority is to rebrand I.V. and change its reputation.</p>\n<p>“The group said the most important thing is to change the image of Isla Vista,” Dudley said. “To take it away from being the party school where you come here, you abuse alcohol, drugs and the environment and take advantage of people, commit crimes.”</p>\n<p>According to Dudley, the committee is working with film director, writer and branding consultant Ken Berris on the campaign. Dudley said Berris’ daughter attended UCSB and Berris has previously collaborated with the university to create ads during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“He’s working very closely with UCSB and they came up with those Halloween ads,” Dudley said. “Everybody felt for the rebranding it was going to be positive … and those beautiful pictures in the background that were donated, he brought that back to the committee and we all liked it.”</p>\n<p>SBCC trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he believes rebranding should be done from the “ground up” by Isla Vistans and not by officials in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m not trying to demean the work of my colleagues … but I believe they made a mistake by not consulting the community,” Abboud said. “This is a very sterile ad, made from people in downtown Santa Barbara who hired a professional consultant to create an ad. That’s why I personally feel like it won’t work, because it doesn’t have that genuine feeling of the town doing it.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, the ad targets locals in Santa Barbara, as well as students and their parents.<br>\n“The audience is going to be ideally everyone in Santa Barbara County, from students, to parents, to residents,” Berris said. “We want to start spreading this new communication about what we want I.V. to become again.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said the campaign is a “massive misstep” because it does not feature elected Isla Vistans.</p>\n<p>“They could use some prominent Isla Vistans in it and not elected officials and public officials from other cities,” Abboud said. “Maybe some of the younger looking people in the ad who look college-aged are Isla Vistans, but … we have a parks board of five people who live in Isla Vista. We have student elected leadership from A.S. None of them are in it.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said the campaign sets an expectation, and communicates to visitors certain behavior is not condoned in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If people see that’s what I.V. stands for, they’re not going to come here with the notion of destroying and thinking that the community itself is going to support the kinds of activities that have been going on there that negatively impacted public safety,” Dudley said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said few people will be exposed to the ad because many people are choosing mediums such as Netflix and Hulu over broadcasted television.</p>\n<p>“The majority of media consumed in Isla Vista is not through TV and cable TV in the traditional sense,” Abboud said. “A lot of people have transitioned to other sources like Netflix and Hulu, and this ad doesn’t seem like it would reach these people.”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said he appreciates I.V. Safe creating the ad, but a brief campaign will not have a large impact on the long-time established I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“The image and quality of life in Isla Vista have been formed over the last 40 plus years (I lived there in the 70s),” Thurlow said in an email. “A media campaign on local television for one season will help but not have much impact. Having said that, we are appreciative of the District Attorney and Ken’s efforts.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, efforts to rebrand I.V. will take several years.</p>\n<p>“Where we’re looking at this is year one,” Berris said. “You don’t rebrand a community or implement new techniques in one year. We’re looking at this as a five to seven year campaign.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said she will view the campaign as successful if it decreases the amount of crime and violence in I.V., and if not the committee may have to change its approach.</p>\n<p>“The way I’ll be interested in looking at it is did it reduce crime, did it reduce arrests, did it reduce injuries,” Dudley said. “If it’s during the time when these ads have had effect, then I think that’s terrific. If I’m not seeing a reduction in those kinds of things then I would think about other ways that we might want to redirect that fund.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he does not believe an ad will convince visitors not to come to I.V. or not to commit crimes during their stay.</p>\n<p>“If your ends are reducing crimes and reducing out of towners, this doesn’t seem like it meets those ends to me,” Abboud said. “I don’t know how an ad reduces crime, and I don’t know how an ad reduces out-of-towners. I think the people who come to Isla Vista to commit crimes are going to come regardless of an ad.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, I.V. Safe’s rebranding effort and exclusion of Isla Vistans in the conversation is not only ineffective but also disrespectful to those who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“No other community would ever have an external government body impose an ad campaign to rebrand it anywhere else in the state or the country, that doesn’t happen,” Abboud said. “It happens very rarely with disenfranchised or disempowered communities and not to respected ones. It shows to me they don’t respect us very much if they’re going to not include us in the conversation 100 percent.”<br>\nDudley said she sees the campaign as a way to show the current status quo of I.V. rather than altering the image of it.</p>\n<p>“I see it as not so much a rebranding, as really shining a spotlight on where Isla Vista is right now,” Dudley said. “For lack of a better word, all the things that happened there have had a very sobering effect on the community. The community has come together where public safety is a high priority for the people that live there.”</p>\n<p>Berris said he believes any community can be rebranded given time and effort.</p>\n<p>“The campaign is essentially the communication tool that lets everybody know that we are changing I.V. back to the great community it was once,” Berris said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/","id":4655,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4654,4653,4652],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AB 3 Heads to Gov.

If approved, the bill will establish the CSD’s formation processes and boundaries and authorize services for I.V., including rent mediation, additional sidewalks and improved lighting.</p>\n<p>Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson presented AB 3 during the Senate session, where the bill passed with a vote of 25-14. Jackson said she and Williams are honored to represent I.V. in its path to self-governance.</p>\n<p>“The current conditions in Isla Vista have reached a breaking point and AB 3 establishes a community services district for providing critical services to the community of Isla Vista which will initially serve as a stepping stone to future stability in that community,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from Williams’ capital office, the assemblymember left Sacramento early Friday morning for Santa Barbara, arriving just in time for the birth of his first child, Ya’Ash Rene Williams. Assemblymember Lorena S. Gonzalez presented AB 3 on the Assembly floor and the passage of the bill moved forward without interruption with a vote of 48-27.</p>\n<p>“Ya’Ash, means Heaven in Navajo. Her middle name also carries a special meaning, as it was is given in honor of Assemblymember Williams’ grandfather, Rene Dietz, a current resident of Ojai,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>AB 3 would require an application to be submitted by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to review the district and place the CSD and a Utility Users Tax (UUT) on the Nov. 2016 general election ballot. The UUT would tax residents a percentage of their utility bills in order to provide funding for the district.</p>\n<p>Williams said I.V. residents have been essential to the bill’s progress during each stage of its development.</p>\n<p>“This has been one of the most community driven bills the legislature has ever seen,” Williams said in a press release. “Everything included in the bill was reviewed during weekly community stakeholder meetings and, after 45 years, Isla Vista will finally have the opportunity to vote on their own governance.”</p>\n<p>Williams’s Chief of Staff Lourdes Jimenez said the large number of residents, students and community leaders involved in the bill’s development demonstrate an environment of open dialogue and positive change.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64710\" style=\"width: 1223px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64710\" data-attachment-id=\"64710\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/ab3_by-eric-swenson-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=1213%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1213,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB3_by Eric Swenson-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64710 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"If passed, AB3 will promote stability where it is currently lacking in the Isla Vista community.

Youth Projects, and the IVRPD,” Jimenez said in an email. “The community process has provided the opportunity for Isla Vistans to connect with one another and has brought together pockets of the community that might not usually interact.</p>\n<p>According to Jimenez, AB 3 community meetings will continue every Tuesday from 6 to 8 p.m. in the conference room of the I.V. Clinic Building at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p>“With AB 3 on the Governor’s desk, it’s of the utmost importance that we have a strong showing of community support for the bill,” Jimenez said in an email. “This means that we are looking to community members to write an email to the governor, send a letter, and/or to call his office and let him know how important this legislation is for the community.”</p>\n<p>Jimenez said one of the key parts of the IVCSD is it allows Isla Vista residents to be directly involved in local government.</p>\n<p>“Residents within the District’s boundaries will have the opportunity to run for one of five elected positions on the Board of Directors,” Jimenez said in an email. “In addition to this direct involvement with a future district, residents will have the opportunity to volunteer with the District and participate in any programs that a future Board of Directors decides to spearhead.</p>\n<p>According to Jimenez, the bill’s passage through the California Legislature has been “empowering,” but work still remains to be done if Governor Brown passes AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Once the bill is chaptered into law, a community-driven campaign is needed to pass the IVCSD during the November 2016 election,” Jimenez said in an email. “Much like our success at the Governor’s desk is dependent on community engagement and support, the IVCSD’s success at the ballot will depend on Isla Vistans turning out to vote and informing one another about the benefits of local representation and self-governance.”</p>\n<p><em>Letters to the Governor can be sent to:</em><br>\n<em> Honorable Jerry Brown</em><br>\n<em> Governor, State of California</em><br>\n<em> State Capitol</em><br>\n<em> Sacramento, California 95814</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64728\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64728\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/ab-3-heads-to-gov-brown-following-senate-passing/","id":4656,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4655,4654,4653],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
