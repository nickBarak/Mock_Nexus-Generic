Easton’s Instagram is where you’ll find the coach talking a bit more about everything to do with Gaucho baseball and, of course, a little bit about how social distancing has played a role in all of this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately for Easton, Zach Torra hadn’t quite yet become the seventh Gaucho to be named All-American under Checketts by the time of that interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, by the way, Torra is the seventh All-American Gaucho of the Checketts era.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Announced just a few days ago, Torra was named to the 2020 Collegiate Baseball Division I All-American Third Team after simply dazzling his way to a 0.36 ERA over 25.1 innings pitched. He went on to strikeout 39 of the 83 batters he faced while holding the opposition to a measly .133 batting average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 3-0 record on the season, Torra held opponents scoreless in three of his four starts, surrendering just a single run. Torra’s most impressive showing, perhaps, came on leap day when he struck out 12 batters over seven scoreless innings en route to a 10-0 series victory over the University of Illinois at Chicago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for the cherry on top, Torra’s 39 Ks was good enough to beat most in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other NCAA news, the organization’s council has voted to approve the addition of an extra year of eligibility for all students whose seasons were impacted by the coronavirus epidemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While much can be left to be desired from the 2020 season, nothing will come. However, this is great news to hear as student athletes around the country will at least be given the opportunity to compete once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And with that, here are some highlights and notes from 2020:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB played their first game under the newly constructed lights of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium on Feb. 17, defeating UC Berkeley 17-7.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB had been holding an eight-game winning streak when the season was terminated.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB handed No. 1 UC Los Angeles their first loss of the season in an 8-5 home victory on March 3.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished 5-0 against Power Five schools.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished first in the Big West Conference with a 13-2 record overall.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished with the fourth-highest winning percentage in the country at 86.7%.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished with a No. 18 average national ranking.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s pitching staff finished with a 1.84 ERA and 5 shutouts.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB hit .237 while holding opponents to a .172 average.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB hit 10 home runs, 5 triples and 22 doubles  for 37 total extra-base hits over their 15 games.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six Gauchos played in all 15 games. Senior infielder McClain O’Connor barely eclipses fellow infielder and junior Marcos Castanon for most at-bats, while the latter barely eclipses the former for most hits on the team.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Christian Kirtley led all Gauchos with 6 doubles while O’Connor’s 2 triples outpace Castanon as well as sophomores Kyle Johnson and Mason Marquez, who are all tied at 1.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Castanon hit 4 bombs for the team lead in home runs while also driving in the most batters with 17 RBIs.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a dogfight for walks with Cole Cummings, Johnson and Kirtley all taking the slow way down to first base 9, 8 and 7 times, respectively.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O’Connor’s 5 stolen bags was the most on the team with Steele Ledford and Jason Willow at 3 and 2, respectively.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished with a 7-1 record at home and 6-1 on the road.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three batters had 10 or more RBIs.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jorge Arellano Jr., Joshua Candau and Noah Owen all finished with a 0.00 ERA while Torra’s 0.36 and Michael McGreevy’s 0.99 were not far behind.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB had 10 pitchers finish with a sub-3.00 ERA and four with 20 or more strikeouts. Torra recorded 39 Ks and Rodney Boone recorded 31.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six UCSB pitchers finished with a K/9 of 9.00 or greater.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the status of COVID-19 everchanging, the current outlook is one that seeks to have in-person schooling upon the start of fall. Despite this, some schools have already announced remote instruction for their fall terms as well as even the entire year. At the moment, expect to see the Gauchos back on the field for 2021, but don’t be too surprised if remote instruction and social distancing extends into next spring. Stay safe and we hope to see Caesar Uyesaka Stadium filled once more!</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just hard to get a sense of where people are at and it’s also hard to get a sense of how your research is impacted,” Alexander LeBrun, Vice President of Academic Affairs for the Graduate Student Association (GSA) and representative to the Graduate Council, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Graduate Council is allowing three additional quarters for time-to-degree and time-to-candidacy, no additional funding is guaranteed, according to the </span><a

And soon we’re going to be opening a couple more [labs], but that doesn’t account for enough graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year-long extension will also not apply to graduate student housing, which LeBrun says is already “not prioritized” by the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there’s too many grad students and not enough housing, it seems like we’ll just have to find stuff in the community,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a third-year Philosophy Ph.D student, LeBrun doesn’t do field research or work in a lab, but said that the humanities and social sciences are still impacted by the pandemic and that those graduate students may need more time to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even me, who just sits at home and does my research, I’m being impacted,” he said. “My mental health is impacting my ability to do my research. It’s so hard to concentrate on arcane, philosophical questions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest determining factors for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding –– which LeBrun says remains uncertain for many due to budget limitations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the “time extensions will allow students to maintain funding eligibility,” according to the Graduate Division FAQ sheet, the time extension “[does] not guarantee an availability of additional funding.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for graduate students, determined either by their department as teaching assistants or research assistants, covers their tuition and health insurance, and provides a salary, LeBrun says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no guarantee to get funding for that next year. It’s up to either your department if you’re a TA, or your advisor if you’re in research whether they have the resources to pay you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LeBrun worries that some graduate students who have no choice but to extend their degree will be forced to take out loans if they don’t receive additional funding from departments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s only a limited number of TAships for each department and if you have to give one to a student who has extended their time-to-degree, then that means another student doesn’t get that TAship,” LeBrun said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing funding and housing, in addition to completing their degrees, are stressors to graduate students, who also take on the role of instructors as TAs –– a role that has only grown more difficult since the start of remote learning, LeBrun said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the vote to extend degree timelines, LeBrun says GSA has just been doing “damage control” to help graduate students. Recently, GSA diverted all graduate student fees –– normally used for events during spring quarter –– to a </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 relief grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, providing over $30,000 of relief to students who are particularly impacted, according to LeBrun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping that a system will be worked out where there’s a pot of money for those [graduate students choosing to extend] to continue to get funding, or at least reduced tuition or something like that.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/","id":1,"author":{"id":234,"name":"Madeline Thompson"},"related":[0,-1,-2],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Santa Barbara To Close Indoor Restaurants, Wineries and Movie Theaters Under Gov.

Gavin Newsom today once again mandated the closure of restaurants, wineries, movie theaters and other indoor operations in counties on the state “watch list,” including Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurants with outdoor serving areas can still operate, and in a press conference today, Newsom encouraged businesses to move “outdoors, which is a way of mitigating the spread of this virus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department has yet to issue an official order about the changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 70% of the state’s population — or 19 California counties — are affected by Newsom’s latest order.
