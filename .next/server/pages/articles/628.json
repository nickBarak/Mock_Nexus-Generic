A 62-43 loss to Cal<br>\nPoly yesterday in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament not<br>\nonly dashed any hopes of becoming back-to-back conference<br>\nchampions, but also ended the Gauchos’ season. “I don’t like<br>\nlosing. I don’t care what the name is on the jersey,” Head Coach<br>\nCarlene Mitchell said. “In the program I’m associated with, you<br>\nexpect to win every time you step on the court. All I can go off of<br>\nin my second year here is that last year I was sitting up here on<br>\nthis podium with a lot better feeling than I am right now.” Santa<br>\nBarbara finished the year at 16-16 overall, going 11-7 in<br>\nconference play. The Mustangs improved to 20-10 and will play for<br>\nthe tournament championship today. The loss is the third straight<br>\nto Cal Poly this year for UCSB. This also marks the first time that<br>\nthe Gauchos have lost to the Mustangs during the postseason. “The<br>\nrecord may not indicate the growth that we had and the competitive<br>\nspirit we had throughout the year, but I’m extremely proud,”<br>\nMitchell said. “This was a group that I was excited to go to<br>\npractice with every day and step on the court and go to battle<br>\nwith.” In every matchup, UCSB was unable to find an answer for 6-5<br>\nMolly Schlemer. Although the Gauchos were able to hold the junior<br>\ncenter to six points in the first half, Schlemer went off for 20 in<br>\nthe second half. “She’s the Big West Player of the Year and we knew<br>\nthey were going to go into her,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman<br>\nsaid. “There’s only so much we can do and I think we did play very,<br>\nvery good defense against her. A player like that’s going to get<br>\nher shots.” While the final score might not reflect it, UCSB got<br>\noff to a great start. The best defensive team in the Big West held<br>\nthe Mustangs to 0-8 shooting to start the game, including 0-6 from<br>\nthree-point range. “Defense is our identity, so we came out with a<br>\nlot of energy, trying to not give them their easy points that<br>\nthey’ve gotten in the past,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said.<br>\n“That was our mindset – take away what they like to do.” Aguirre,<br>\nwho has played extremely well against Cal Poly this season,<br>\naveraging 11 points in the two matchups, caught fire early, scoring<br>\nSanta Barbara’s first two baskets. Then, Tilleman, last year’s Big<br>\nWest Tournament MVP, got in on the action, knocking down two<br>\nstraight baskets of her own to give the Gauchos an 8-2 lead. “I<br>\njust try do what I need to do,” Aguirre said. “I try to be<br>\naggressive and take open shots. We knew we had to be the aggressors<br>\nfrom the beginning, so I think all of us had that mindset.”<br>\nHowever, Cal Poly was never out of the game and drained<br>\nback-to-back threes to take a 12-10 lead. The score remained close<br>\nthe remainder of the half and the Mustangs eventually took a 22-19<br>\nlead into halftime. After starting the game 0-8, the Mustangs shot<br>\n9-16 for 56.3 percent the rest of the half. UCSB, meanwhile, was<br>\ntaking good shots, but was unable to convert shots it would usually<br>\nmake, shooting just 30.4 percent from the field. “I thought the<br>\nkids competed extremely well in the first half and shots didn’t<br>\nfall,” Mitchell said. “We got a lot of wide open looks and<br>\nsometimes you can only play the pressure defense for so long and<br>\nthen you have to get a point here or there to be able to keep that<br>\nup.” Cal Poly went to its Big West Player of the Year to start the<br>\nsecond half and Schlemer answered the call, scoring four straight<br>\npoints and sparking a 13-2 run to put SB in a 12 point hole. The<br>\nGauchos didn’t help their cause though, turning the ball over six<br>\ntimes and going 1-7 in first seven and a half minutes of play. “You<br>\ntry to full front [Schlemer] and they’ll lob over the top,”<br>\nMitchell said. “You try to play behind her and double and they have<br>\nblue-collar players that can knock down the 15 foot jumper.” As<br>\ntime went on, Santa Barbara continued to fall part as it could do<br>\nno better than just trade baskets with Cal Poly. The deficit<br>\ncontinued to grow and became too much to overcome. Despite holding<br>\nCal Poly to 22 points in the first half, the Mustangs unleashed<br>\ntheir potent offense in the second half, scoring 40 points compared<br>\nto UCSB’s 24. Overall, Cal Poly shot 43.8 percent from the field<br>\nand outscored the Gauchos 22-12 in the paint. Defensively, Cal Poly<br>\nlimited UCSB’s leading scorer, senior forward Sweets Underwood, to<br>\njust four points, nearly eight below her average. For the Gauchos,<br>\njunior guard Nicole Nesbit paced the team offensively, scoring 11<br>\npoints, all of which came in the second half. Aguirre also<br>\ncontributed 11 points while Tilleman added 10 rebounds in the<br>\ndefeat. “I don’t think we can ever be satisfied with not getting to<br>\nthe NCAA Tournament, but it’s also not about just this one game,”<br>\nTilleman said. “It’s about the journey we took as a team and the 32<br>\ngames that we played. So, I’m not satisfied, but I feel that we<br>\nlearned a lot this season and I’m going to take a lot from playing<br>\nwith these people and playing for this program.” The game marked<br>\nthe last time playing in a Gaucho uniform for seniors Aguirre,<br>\nTilleman and Underwood. While they leave the program with a Big<br>\nWest Championship from last year, they know that the UCSB women’s<br>\nbasketball team is about winning. Next year’s objective for Santa<br>\nBarbara will be no different – continue the Gaucho tradition.<br>\n  <em>This article is an online exclusive and did<br>\nnot appear in the print edition of the Daily<br>\nNexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50593\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50593\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/","id":628,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[627,626,625],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Travels to SDSU for WNIT Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s rare that in sports, or life for that matter, that you get a second chance.

We have nothing to lose.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last game resulted in a devastating 62-43 loss to rival Cal Poly in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament. Although UCSB got off to a fantastic start, holding the Mustangs to 0-8 shooting to begin the game, the Gauchos struggled to score the basketball, shooting just 34.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Add to that a 20-point second half from Cal Poly’s 6’5’’ junior center Molly Schlemer and UCSB began to watch its season potentially come to an end. However, three days later, the Gauchos became of one of four Big West teams selected for the WNIT. This marks the second straight postseason appearance in Mitchell’s two-year reign.</p>\n<p>“It’ll help us to have a little edge because we’re still upset about that [game] and we don’t like how that game potentially could’ve ended our season,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I think that’s going to put some fuel to our fire and if anything, it’s going to motivate us for this game coming up tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>San Diego State will also enter tomorrow’s matchup looking for redemption. The Aztecs had a spectacular season, posting a 15-1 Mountain West record to win the regular season title for the second straight year. The team also won 17 consecutive games and tied the program record for most wins in a single season. As a result of winning its conference, SDSU earned an automatic bid to the WNIT, but fell short of going to the NCAA Tournament when it lost to Fresno State in the Mountain West Tournament Championship.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious that they’re extremely athletic and I’m sure they feel like they should be in the NCAA Tournament with the record that they have,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’m sure they’ll come out and we’ll probably see one of their best games.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos are 12-18 against San Diego State. However, the last time these two teams faced off was Jan. 2, 1999 and UCSB won 78-50.</p>\n<p>Dominating the conference, the Aztecs rank first in the Mountain West in scoring defense, holding teams to 52.4 points per game. However, San Diego St. is an offensive minded team, averaging 68.7 points per game while shooting 43.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge for SDSU is senior guard Courtney Clements, who ranks second in the Mountain West and first on the team in scoring with 17.5 points per game. In addition, senior guard Chelsea Hopkins, a transfer from Duke, averages 13.5 points, 8.1 rebounds and 6.8 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>“Hopkins likes to get in the paint,” Mitchell said. “She can knock down a three, but she wants to get in the gaps and make things happen. And with Clements, you have to contest the shot. You can’t foul her or give her open looks from three. You want to try and make her put it on the floor and make her a jump shooter.”</p>\n<p>Of course, SDSU will be facing the toughest defensive team in the Big West as UCSB holds teams to a conference leading 52.4 points per game and 35.8 shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“Defense is our identity, so like always for us, we have to play defense and get stops,” Aguirre said.</p>\n<p>The final step in defense is rebounding and Santa Barbara ranks first in the Big West in rebounding defense, holding its opponents to 32.5 boards per game, which will be especially important against the Aztecs, which typically grab 41 rebounds per game. In addition, if UCSB can keep SDSU off the boards, they will likely be able to shut down 6’6’’ senior center Malia Nahinu, who averages nearly eight points per game off of rebound putbacks.</p>\n<p>“Watching film of them, Fresno State didn’t have anyone at [Nahinu’s] size and they were able to push her away from the basket,” Mitchell said. “She’ll get a lot of points if you don’t block her out on rebound putbacks, but she’s a different type of player than Schlemer. And we’ve seen 6-6 throughout the year.”</p>\n<p>Offensively for the Gauchos, senior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team, averaging 11.8 points and 9.2 rebounds per game. She also shoots 48.3 percent from the field. In the backcourt, Nesbit paces the team, averaging 10.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB shoots 40.2 percent from the field, but struggled to make easy shots against Cal Poly. However, the Gauchos are best when they can get out, run and make some easy baskets in transition.</p>\n<p>“We need to make them have to work in transition defense and we’ve seen from day one that most of the time our easy baskets come in transition if we have an attack mentality,” Mitchell said. “That will be the main thing and then you have to knock down shots.

Underwood recorded a game-high 16 points and nine rebounds while Nesbit tallied 12 points on 6-9 shooting and a team-high three assists.</p>\n<p>“Sweets has done an amazing job all year long of being calm and being very consistent in her play,” Mitchell said. “She’s a senior, she wants to keep her season alive and she stepped up and made big plays.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team in the first half, scoring eight of her 12 points in the opening period. Back-to-back jumpers from Nesbit capped off an 8-1 from UCSB to give the team a 12-5 lead early in the game.</p>\n<p>From there, the first half became a defensive stalemate, as one might expect from the top two defensive teams in the Big West. After a five minute scoring drought for both teams, the Gauchos finally grabbed the momentum, ending the half on a 6-0 run to take a 22-13 lead into the locker rooms.</p>\n<p>“I think we started attacking more,” Underwood said. “In that last timeout, Coach Mitch emphasized to us that transition is our best offense, so we had to get to the paint and attack them — try to score as many points in the paint as we could.”</p>\n<p>Northridge’s 13 points ties for fifth in the UCSB record book for fewest points by an opponent in a first half.</p>\n<p>“When I walked into the locker room, I went crazy on the team, even though everyone thinks I’m really calm most of the time,” Mitchell said. “When I huddled them up for the second half, I told them, ‘you’re right. You know I’m crazy, but you just held a team to 13 points.’ And 13 just happens to be my lucky number.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s didn’t let go of its lead in the second half as the Matadors were unable to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to fewer than seven points.</p>\n<p>“We always stress the first four minutes of each half to set the tone,” Nesbit said. “When we came out in the second half, we knew that we just needed to keep our lead going and extend it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did in fact continue to build on their lead. Beginning with two free throws from Underwood after an intentional foul call on Northridge, Underwood caught fire, scoring eight straight points to give UCSB its largest lead of the game at 41-25 with just under five minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a physical game, but a key part of our team is mental toughness,” Underwood said. “Our motto is, ‘don’t let anything hold you back,’ so it’s just about brushing it off, even if you get fouled on the shot. It’s always the next play and the next shot you have.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, Santa Barbara held Northridge to 31 points on 24 percent shooting, including 0-12 from three-point range. UCSB becomes the only team this season to shutout the Matadors from behind the arc this season. The Gauchos also outrebounded the Matadors 37-29.</p>\n<p>“They did a great job [defensively],” Mitchell said. “We worked extremely hard on defensive end. This time of the year, hopefully it wins you some games.”</p>\n<p>Winning in the Bren Events Center, the same arena where the playoff run began one year ago and resulted in a Big West Championship for UCSB, the Gauchos enter the semifinals tomorrow with momentum. However, they know that it’s a new year and will have to overcome a Cal Poly team they have yet to beat.</p>\n<p>“It’s March Madness,” Nesbit said. “We know what we’re capable of looking at last year, but this year is a completely different year. We have our goals set, and we’re trying to achieve them.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off tomorrow is set for approximately 2:30 p.m. at the Honda Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50592\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50592\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/","id":626,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[625,624,623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Takes Down SDSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos get back to .500 with a win over the Aztecs","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60353\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis2-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1457969710\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60427\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60353\" data-attachment-id=\"60353\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/2-1-15christinademarzomenstennis2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis2-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.8\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Playing against San Diego State University, Andrew Riminton hits the ball towards his opponent.

The Gauchos won their second straight in Santa Barbara, edging out the Aztecs 5-2. With this win, UCSB improves to 2-2 overall and SDSU is currently 3-2 with the loss.</p>\n<p>“Playing at home is truly phenomenal. There’s really just nothing like it,” sophomore Morgan Mays explained. “The fans were great and I really have to give them thanks for their support. They really helped pull us through today.”</p>\n<p>Mays was truly surrounded by support from the get-go when he and his teammate, junior Andrew Riminton, found themselves in the tiebreaker match for the doubles point. They battled to a 6-4 win to grab their first doubles point of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The sophomore stud found himself playing right in front of his cheering crowd of gold when it was time to break off into singles as well. Playing in the No. 1 spot for his Gaucho team, he faced off against senior Thorsten Bertsch, who came in with a singles record of 2-1 on the season. Mays fought hard with great energy and boasted his skills with superior placement on every point. For the second time of the day, Mays bested Bertsch, in two straight sets of 6-4.</p>\n<p>“I executed my game plan really perfectly,” Mays said. “I wanted to dictate with my forehand and hit the shots he gave me, and I was very consistent.”</p>\n<p>Another exciting win for the Gauchos came from the No. 5 court where junior Nathan Eshmade looked for his second win of the day after contributing to UCSB’s doubles round. Eshmade took the lead early, winning the first set 6-4 before dropping the second by the same score. He finished his opponent off in the tiebreaker with ease allowing him just two games in the set, and clinched the Gaucho’s victory for the day.</p>\n<p>Freshman Cody Rakela was another Gaucho to add a point on the board for his team. The rookie continued to show his potential, winning his match on the No. 3 court in straight sets of 6-3, 6-3.</p>\n<p>The final match of the day took place on the No. 6 court where sophomore Teague Hamilton played to further stretch the lead of the Gaucho’s overall victory. He silenced his opponent in the first set, winning 6-0, and then edged him out once more in the second 7-6 to give the Gauchos a 5-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road next weekend playing at No. 37 University of San Diego Saturday and UC Irvine on Sunday. Matches are set to start at 1:30 p.m. and noon, respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/","id":627,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[626,625,624],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
