Surfrider Foundation, along with the nonprofit ReRip, will place bins on DP to collect and repurpose broken surfboards, wetsuits and other gear.<em> Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Surfrider Foundation will launch a coordinated project with nonprofit organization ReRip next quarter to collect and repurpose broken or unwanted surf equipment.</p>\n<p>The foundation intends to place a collection bin along the beachside intersections of Del Playa Drive for recycling all forms of damaged or used surf equipment.</p>\n<p>“The collection bin will be a physical emblem of Isla Vista sustainability efforts,” said Benny Drescher, an intern for I.V. Surfrider.</p>\n<p>The broken longboards, wetsuits and other surf gear will be distributed to artists and ReRip for repairs, and Drescher said ReRip will also use the materials to teach disadvantaged youth how to surf.</p>\n<p>According to ReRip’s website, the company salvages and reuses “everything from fins and broken bits to complete boards.” The company repairs “rideable boards” to be surfed again; some boards are resold and many are given away to schools, nonprofits and people in need.</p>\n<p>While the closest collection site to donate used surf materials is currently located in Ventura, the new collection bin initiative hopes to offer a more “accessible and convenient” means for student surfers to repurpose their trash.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) is still discussing procedures for maintaining the bins and managing their capacity.</p>\n<p>“The project needs stewardship,” said Dave Hubbard, director of the IVRPD, noting the tendency of “loose objects on Del Playa to get thrown off the cliff into the ocean.”</p>\n<p>At their board meeting on Nov. 10, the IVRPD Board of Directors voiced potential concerns about the project’s implementation, including the possibility of Isla Vista party-goers “pulling donations out and throwing them around the park,” or “setting the bin on fire.”</p>\n<p>“If the problem appears to be a reality, we can add a lock to the bins or erect a fence that will surround the bins,” said Surfrider organizers in their proposal. “Surfrider officers will frequently check the bins to organize materials and report to ReRip when a donation pickup is needed.”</p>\n<p>Together, I.V. Surfrider and IVRPD plan to make adjustments to the proposed wood box design and are considering incorporating surf and environmentalism-themed art on the bin’s frame to deter vandalism.</p>\n<p>With design proposals still underway, I.V. Surfrider aims to finalize the sustainability project by the middle of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74315\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74315\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/bins-seek-to-salvage-surf-gear/","id":4487,"author":{"id":104,"name":"Aly Giammanco"},"related":[4486,4485,4484],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V. a Lucrative Market for Deliveries","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As a small town with a quirky, youthful populace, Isla Vista has needs that differ from its surrounding areas.

Students who understand its distinct culture are able to fulfill I.V.’s demands through various entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>\n<p>David Welsh and Michael Bakkie, two fourth-year economics majors at UCSB, saw a gap in supply and demand: Students needed a way to get groceries but didn’t have access to a car, and they had to rely on friends to go to a grocery store.</p>\n<p>They began developing the plan for their delivery model two years ago, culminating in the creation of Isla Vista Grocery Delivery, founded earlier this November.</p>\n<p>The alternative to making commutes to grocery stores, Welsh said, was either going to local, “overpriced” I.V. stores, eating at restaurants or getting a meal plan, all of which are more expensive than “reasonable eating.”</p>\n<p>The combination of students’ lack of options and mobility created a space for opportunists like Welsh and Bakkie to provide a solution.</p>\n<p>“I have always dreamed of being an entrepreneur, and this was a great way to start in a local market that I really know very well because I am one of these college students that would use this service,” Welsh said.</p>\n<p>The way Welsh sees it, a trip to the grocery store takes about an hour to complete: One has to drive there, drive back and buy everything. To a lot of people, he said, the effort needed to deal with that hassle is worth about $10.</p>\n<p>“If we can streamline that process and do it for a lot of students, that’s good business,” he said. “We really think this will save students’ time and money in the long run.”</p>\n<p>Welsh believes a lot of students will get behind “a startup started by other Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>This entrepreneurial ambition is also what drove fourth-year UCSB student Reese Hammerstrom to launch his own delivery service, D.I.V.E., during the fall of last year.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he came up with the business idea during the previous summer playing “Isla Vista’s sport” beer die.</p>\n<p>“Our die would keep bouncing off the balcony into the ocean and we would have to stop playing the game,” he said. “I was thinking of ways for a service where I could essentially press a button and dice would appear at my door.”</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he bought playing dice from Amazon that summer, delivered dice for a few weeks and, come Fall Quarter, realized there was opportunity to expand.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom was able to pinpoint what I.V. needed through direct interaction with local culture and consequently developed a business model. He called the model D.I.V.E., an acronym for Delivering Isla Vista Entertainment.</p>\n<p>Though Hammerstrom began by delivering supplies such as dice, lighters, ping-pong balls, cups and “chasers” to his friends, he “realized there was a bigger opportunity to expand beyond party supplies.”</p>\n<p>Last summer, he partnered with I.V. Market and now delivers party supplies, ice cream, drinks, munchies, house supplies and school supplies, “essentially anything a college student could need with the exception of cooked food,” he said.</p>\n<p>D.I.V.E.’s Vice President of Operations, Robert Holland, said the company is all about giving customers “complete control of their time.”</p>\n<p>“Isla Vistans live an active lifestyle, and going to the store can be kind of a drag,” Holland said. “D.I.V.E. takes care of your everyday shopping needs, and for the fun times, D.I.V.E.’s got your dice, limes and Sprite, too.”</p>\n<p>Currently, delivery has been centered around a concentrated demand for Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, specifically the flavor “Half Baked.”</p>\n<p>“I think that’s just a factor of the current hours of operation. Right now we’re only open from 7:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. every night. That time kind of lends itself to ice cream and party supplies,” Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>There has been a particular surge in customer activity coming from the dorms, Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really great for freshmen,” he said, “Most people in their first year usually don’t have access to cars and to all these supplies and ice cream, and so freshman now are just pretty stoked about this service.”</p>\n<p>UCSB student Kaitlyn Hague said she believes the need for delivery came from high demand, a lack of mobility and “student laziness.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve needed ice and dice last minute for parties, but some nights I’m just binge-watching Netflix and I really want ice cream without getting out of bed,” she said.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Sarah Cragin, another student user of delivery services, said she has used it for party supplies like alcohol chasers because “we don’t realize we need it until the last second.”</p>\n<p>As students who once needed services unavailable in I.V., Welsh, Bakkie and Hammerstrom self-serviced. They filled not only their own needs as community members but also capitalized on the gap between supply and demand in I.V.</p>\n<p>As long as students in I.V. sustain their unique desires, student entrepreneurs will find a way to bridge the town’s gap of service.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1,3 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low priority calls. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Citizen Online Reporting system, as the Sheriff’s Office has named the software, is accessible through their website, sbsheriff.org, under the title “File an Online Report” on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, the public information officer for the County Sheriff’s Office, said the idea for the service was well-researched and that several deputies have worked to bring it into fruition.</p>\n<p>“We have deputies who research and selected the Cop Logic program and went through the process of researching what it would take to bring it to Santa Barbara County … and went through all the logistics to make it happen,” she said.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this new online tool is to reduce the amount of low-priority phone calls.</p>\n<p>In a press release Monday morning, Hoover said the “around-the-clock accessibility” will enable residents to “file a report at a time that is convenient to them without waiting for a deputy to respond or call them back.” Reportable incidents include identity theft, vandalism and stolen property, as well as civil complaints such as animal complaints, harassment via telephone and child custody violations.</p>\n<p>Hoover said this will give the deputies who normally file these incidents time to investigate other pressing instances of crime, as the software is meant to streamline the activities of police, “especially during a time when resources are limited.”</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office plans to focus more of its time on investigating trends in crime rather than filing reports which individuals themselves are able to submit.<br>\n“It just cuts back on the amount of time the deputy is working on paperwork that could be filled out by the citizen,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>She said the site is intuitive, but one problem that users might encounter is failing to understand the law enforcement’s jurisdiction when reporting a crime. Police cannot see to a crime that is outside of its legal capacity, as its system distinguishes on its web page. The Sheriff’s Office will not be investigating crimes outside of the county and encourages citizens to submit reports to their corresponding sheriff’s offices. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol office is located on 6504 Trigo Rd.</p>\n<p>For those unsure of how to file a report, the Sheriff’s Office has also created a video tutorial illustrating the process, which they have linked in the preface to their report submission software.</p>\n<p>As for the price of installing the online service, Hoover said the system cost $22,500 to install and that it will cost an additional $15,000 per year to keep running.</p>\n<p>Despite the online platform, officials say urgent offenses and situations must be reported directly with a 911 call.</p>\n<p>“The system is not designed to take the place of the deputy; if residents need to talk to a deputy, by all means we still want them to call,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The program is called Cop Logic, not top logic.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74792\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74792\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/sheriff-implements-new-online-reporting-system/","id":4489,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4488,4487,4486],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
