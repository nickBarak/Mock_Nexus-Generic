Cal, meanwhile, enters its first true road game of the season at 6-2. This will be the Golden Bears’ first trip to Santa Barbara since the inaugural game at the Thunderdome in 1979.</p>\n<p>“After this loss to UCLA, knowing that we can compete with any school in the country, we’re feeling extremely motivated. To get a big fish out here at the Thunderdome, we’re just excited about it,” senior guard Kyle Boswell said. “It’s going to be a fun experience, hopefully a lot of people will come out to the game, and we’ll put on a good show and the result will show it.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite the 3-3 mark, the Gauchos have outperformed their record, narrowly dropping games against Utah State and Colorado without junior center Alan Williams. With Williams, Santa Barbara is 3-1, the lone loss coming to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“We’re encouraged by the fact that we can compete in a game like this in the future. We had a good shot at putting them away and getting the upset,” Boswell said. “We have to take out the positive things because we have a huge game on Friday against Cal coming to our place. We just know that we can play with anyone and we’ve proven that this year.”</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, UCSB did not look like a team from a smaller conference facing a power conference team. Instead, Santa Barbara battled for the majority of the game, taking a 42-42 tie into the half at legendary Pauley Pavilion. UCSB even led in the second half before a run by the Bruins put the game out of reach. Big Al led the Gauchos with 23 points to go along with eight rebounds, but the outside shooting of UCSB was the real storyline in this game.</p>\n<p>Boswell finished with 18 points shooting 5-9 from behind the arc. Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Bryson and junior guard Zalmico Harmon each shot 3-5 from the three while sophomore forward Taran Brown was 2-6. Overall, UCSB shot 50 percent on threes, including an impressive 9-14 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of good shooters on the perimeter surrounding Al down low, so if we’re not hitting threes and having people close down on us hard, we’re going to go inside,” Boswell said. “If we go inside and they’re doubling Al, we’re going to kick it out. We have a lot of inside-outside game that we pride ourselves on, especially with two quick point guards that can get into the lane.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to another Pac-12 opponent, UCSB hosts a Golden Bears’ squad that defeated Big West team UC Irvine 73-56 on Monday. Senior guard Justin Cobbs leads Cal with 14 points and over six assists per game. Senior forward Richard Solomon will provide a formidable opponent down low against Big Al, as the senior averages a double-double with over 11 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly has the weapons to challenge the Golden Bears, led by Big Al’s Big West leading numbers of 27.5 points, 10.8 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. Bryson ranks second on the team with 12.7 points per game, while Boswell is third at 11 points and Brown fourth at 10.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup against Cal looms as the Gauchos biggest nonconference home game of the season.</p>\n<p>“[A victory against Cal] would be huge. UCLA was a really big team and that just showed us just how dominant Big Al is,” Boswell said. “We nearly beat Utah State and Colorado even without Al, so the fact that he’s going to be a presence on Friday, they’re going to have to pick their spots. He’s going to cause a lot of problems for Cal so hopefully we’ll take advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s tip-off against Cal is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The effort would be enough for the Gauchos to overcome Hampton 66-62.</p>\n<p>“As a coach, you’re always proud when you watch players mature and grow into themselves and their confidence and their skills,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “[Mason has] worked extremely hard on her game at both ends of the floor and she’s playing really calm and like a senior.”</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara has become known for its fast-paced offense this year, the Gauchos proved their defense is still how they win games.</p>\n<p>After going down 15-18 early in the first half, Mason swatted away a shot from senior forward Alyssa Bennett, which led to a three point basket on the other end and tied the game. A turnover on the other end led to a trey by senior guard Melissa Zornig and a steal and layup in transition from sophomore guard Jasmine Ware completed an 8-0 run for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The increased defensive intensity started by Mason led to a 17-3 run and the Gauchos eventually took a 34-24 lead into the locker room.</p>\n<p>“I think it was our energy on defense that really helped get our offense going,” Ware said. “I think we started talking because we were a little flat in the beginning.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB would give up its lead as Hampton used offensive rebounds to spark a 15-4 run and tie the game at 39 all. In just the first five minutes of the second half, the Lady Pirates grabbed eight offensive boards, which led to nine second chance points.</p>\n<p>On the game, Santa Barbara was outrebounded 46-30, giving up 24 offensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They are amazing athletes and we knew their second, third and fourth opportunity a lot of times is their best shot,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t do a good job of blocking out. No excuses. We are very lucky to win giving up 24 offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>The rest of the half, the two teams traded baskets and for the fourth time this year, the Gauchos played in a game went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>Down two with just over a minute remaining, freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe poked the ball from one of Hampton’s leaders, senior guard Nicole Hamilton, and fed Mason on the fast break, who not only converted the layup, but earned the foul. With the made free throw, Mason gave UCSB a 61-60 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a really hard foul. I was a little hurt, but my teammates were like, ‘it doesn’t really matter. You’re going to have to knock down this free throw,’” Mason said. “I just had to get up and focus on the free throw.”</p>\n<p>Solid defense from the Gauchos on the next possession forced an air ball from Hamilton and the Gauchos were able to finish the Lady Pirates off from the line, going 5-6 down the stretch from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 3-2 on the year while Hampton falls to an identical 3-2 mark.</p>\n<p>Anchoring the team offensively for the Lady Pirates was Bennett, who finished the night with 23 points, 21 coming in the second half, and 16 rebounds. She was one of three players in double-figures for Hampton.</p>\n<p>“It was a really nice win,” Mitchell said. “They’re a very talented team. They probably have a pro player in Alyssa Bennett and even though she ended up with 23 points, we made her work extremely hard for those 23 points, so it’s a great win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to play this Saturday at home against San Diego State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

One of eight players on the roster listed at six feet or taller, she led SDSU to a phenomenal 65.9 percent shooting performance from the field, including 70.6 percent in the second half.</p>\n<p>Down four, Warren stepped outside and knocked down a three to bring her team within one at 45-44. She went on to score San Diego State’s next eight points to give the Aztecs a one point advantage just over halfway through the second half.</p>\n<p>“[Warren] started out at North Carolina. We know she could’ve played anywhere in the country,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’ll have to go back and look at when she scored and how she scored. If we were in man, really the only body type that could match up against her was Big Mel.”</p>\n<p>Despite the Aztec shooting percentage, the Gauchos’ three point shooting kept them in the game. Ranked last in the Big West in threes with just 16 on the year entering the game, UCSB made over half its season total in one game, shooting nine of 19 from behind the arc for 47.4 percent.</p>\n<p>“We were getting wide open looks, but I think more towards the second half, we were taking shots too quickly and weren’t attacking as much as we should have,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “The mentality we should have had from the beginning was to attack.”</p>\n<p>The supremacy by both teams in their respective styles led to a game that would be decided in the final seconds.</p>\n<p>Down six with a minute and a half remaining, senior guard Melissa Zornig hit a three to bring the game within one possession. A steal on the inbounds and a converted layup from Nesbit completed a five-point swing, making a game that seemed over anybody’s game.</p>\n<p>“We were just trying to pressure it,” Zornig said. “We wanted to get the ball back. We wanted to press them and see what we could do with it.”</p>\n<p>In its full court press, UCSB forced SDSU to travel and was given the opportunity to take the lead with 48.5 seconds left in the game, but could not create a good shot on the offensive end. On the miss, Santa Barbara was forced to foul and freshman guard Ariell Bostick made one of two free throws to put her team up three.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, Nesbit, who had been hot from distance at 5-7 from behind the arc at the time, received an open look from the left wing, but the three bounced off the back of the iron.</p>\n<p>“We drew it up and knew we needed a look at a three,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the first shot, so Mel came in. She took a look at it and then I did get a good look. We did get the look we wanted. It just didn’t go in.”</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs improve to 1-4, the Gauchos drop to 3-3.</p>\n<p>“With the competitor I am, it’s disappointing to know that’s their first win of the season. That’s frustrating when you’re at home,” Mitchell said. “We had our opportunities. We went into halftime up six and we turned stagnant against that two-three zone (in the second half) and it cost us.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB shot 52.0 percent on the game and had three players in double-figures. Nesbit finished with a game-high and career-high 22 points while senior guard Destini Mason and Zornig tallied with 20 and 14 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We had three players in double figures, but again, it’s our guards,” Mitchell said. “We have to find someone else to give us a scoring punch so [the seniors] don’t have to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to rebound quickly from the loss as they travel to Pepperdine Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53343\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53343\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-30/gauchos-fall-to-aztecs-in-close-game-at-home/","id":587,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[586,585,584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels South to Face Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos try to rebound from 71-67 loss to SDSU tonight against Pepperdine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team’s ability to have short term memory will be tested this week.</p>\n<p>Just three days off a rough loss to San Diego State, the Gauchos play Pepperdine on the road tonight, the first of two games in the next three days.</p>\n<p>“We take each game game by game,” freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “It sucks to lose, but we have to let it go and move forward because we do have other games.

Even then, senior guard Nicole Nesbit was given a wide-open three to tie the game in the few second remaining, but missed.</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team with a career-high 22 points. Moving over to the shooting guard position this season, Nesbit currently ranks third in the Big West in scoring with 17.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“When you play the point, the mentality is to pass first, shoot second,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Onome’s thought process is to dribble penetrate and get everyone else involved, so that frees up Nic and allows her to have legs late in the game because she’s not having to handle the ball against pressure for 40 minutes. In critical moments, she knows and understands we want the ball in her hands.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB shot a season-high 9-19 from three point range, in the second half, the team began settling for jumpers instead of attacking the rim, playing into the tactics of the Aztecs, who played a zone defense.</p>\n<p>Tonight, Santa Barbara will see a zone once again against Pepperdine, who will look to pack the paint.</p>\n<p>“Zones are so different for people and sometimes I smile and sometimes I want to pull my hair out because when you have players that can dribble penetrate and can shoot, they have all the different elements, but there’s something about a zone that sometimes makes them hesitant,” Mitchell said. “When you’re playing one on one or man defense, it’s a lot easier to use your skill or ability to either create your own shot or create for others. Zones make everyone have to be on the same page.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine enters tonight’s matchup at 2-5. Losers of four straight games, all of which were on the road, the Waves return home in need of a victory.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good team. We have seen some very talented individuals so far, but I think Pepperdine is the team that is the best overall team in understanding their roles and playing well together,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced, play inside-out, they have skilled players as well as athletes, and they’re battle-tested. They played Oregon and UCLA close; they’ve won on the road in Seattle.”</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos will keep an eye on defensively is junior guard Bria Richardson. Pepperdine’s leading scorer in five of its seven games, Richardson averages 16.6 points, 5.3 assists and 2.6 steals per contest.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at Firestone Fieldhouse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53346\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53346\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-03/ucsb-travels-south-to-face-pepperdine/","id":588,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[587,586,585],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
