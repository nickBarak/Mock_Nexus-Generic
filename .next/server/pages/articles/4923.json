The first half ended with UCSB on top 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put on a beautiful display of attacking in the third quarter. They outscored Cal Baptist 6-2 in the period to give them what appeared to be a comfortable 10-5 lead heading into the fourth.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist exploded with three goals in the first three minutes of the final quarter. However, freshman utility Sarah Snyder responded by netting her third and fourth goals of the game for the Gauchos. UCSB earned their first win of the season in their Winter Invitational debut 13-8.</p>\n<p>Later that Friday afternoon, UCSB went up against Indiana in a top-15 battle. UCSB was first on the board thanks to senior captain Taylor Shore. Moments later, Snyder scored her fifth total goal of the day. Indiana returned the favor with two goals of their own to end the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>The second quarter passed in the same fashion as the Gauchos scored the first two goals before the Hoosiers answered with a pair of goals to tie it up.</p>\n<p>That was the last of Indiana’s scoring for the game, because UCSB didn’t concede a goal for the entire second half. Sophomore utility and former Hoosier Kate Pipkin scored two goals in the second half against her former team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the day with an 8-4 victory, looking confident for the games ahead.</p>\n<p>Day two of the Winter Invitational brought better weather and provided a tougher opponent in No. 8 Michigan. This was a defensive battle from the start. The first quarter came to a close with the score of 1-1 in an even matchup.</p>\n<p>The second quarter began with a quick goal from the Gauchos when freshman utility Abbey Grosse gave a nifty lob pass over the defender to Taylor Shore, who slotted it home for the goal.</p>\n<p>With about two minutes left in the half, the Wolverines scored to even it up at 2-2. The Gauchos went on to earn a power play with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half as head coach Serela Kay called a timeout. The ensuing play led to Shore finding the prolific Snyder for the goal to take the lead at 3-2.</p>\n<p>Michigan quickly responded with a lob shot attempt that landed on the line of the goal as the buzzer sounded, resulting in a no goal call from the referees.</p>\n<p>Michigan threw in three goals in the third as they began to pull away. UCSB found themselves down 4-5 heading into the final period.</p>\n<p>The Wolverine defense stepped up in the fourth period, making it difficult for the Gaucho attack time and time again. UCSB was unable to score in the quarter and was defeated 4-7.</p>\n<p>“The Michigan game really sticks out in my mind because we controlled the game all the way until the fourth quarter,” said Kay. “We’re young, so the fourth quarter moments and game situation moments are really important for us.”</p>\n<p>About an hour later, UCSB had to jump back in the pool for another game as they faced off against the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. The Gauchos dominated from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Natalie Selin scored a first quarter hat-trick as the Gauchos led 5-1 at the end of the opening quarter.</p>\n<p>Early in the third quarter, Shore earned another hat-trick as UCSB went up 9-3. Pomona-Pitzer added a couple more goals to their tally, but UCSB eventually earned their third win of the weekend by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The final day of the Winter Invite was layered with heavy rain and constant winds when UCSB squared off versus Marist, which scored double digit goals in its first two games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stayed with their defensive theme in this game, holding the Red Foxes to only two goals in the first half. UCSB’s balanced attack resulted in seven goals to make it 7-2 at the break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to make it difficult for Marist, which could only total five goals in the entire contest. Snyder and Shore stayed on their terrific goal-scoring pace, each scoring in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished off the Red Foxes by the score of 11-5 to earn their fourth victory of the weekend.</p>\n<p>As the rain slowly died down, UCSB took the pool against powerhouse No. 2 USC in the final game of the 2017 Winter Invitational. USC came into the game with an average margin of victory of over 11 goals in their previous four games at the Winter Invite.</p>\n<p>The Trojans continued their goal-scoring frenzy, pouring in seven goals in the first period of play. The Gauchos struggled to get anything together as they trailed 2-12 at the half.</p>\n<p>Snyder, Selin, Trabucco and senior attacker Brenna Thomas scored the Gauchos five goals in the game. USC never took its foot off the gas, winning 19-5 to give it an undefeated record for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Despite the tough loss to close out their host event, the Gauchos felt good about their performances throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with where we’re at,” Kay said. “I’m actually happy that the weather came in and was windy and stormy; I think it gave us something that we’re really not used to so I think it’ll make us stronger in the end.”</p>\n<p>Shore and Snyder led the team in goals with 11 each. The standout freshman Snyder was very productive over the weekend in her first action with the team.</p>\n<p>“She [Snyder] can play on the outside and on the inside,” Kay said. “She was scoring on power plays, on the perimeter and in front of the cage. She’s a scorer. She’s a finisher. She has no fear.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend, UCSB will make the trip to Tempe, Ariz., home of Arizona State, to take part in the Arizona State Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/","id":4923,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4922,4921,4920],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini","biography":"Not available","articles":[1887,4900,4904,4905,4906,4907,4920,4921,4923,4924,4925,4926,4927,4928,4929,4930,4931,4932,4933,4934,5557],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host Winter Invitational to Begin New Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 9 ranked UCSB women’s water polo team looks to continue its success of last season as it starts off the 2017 season at the annual UCSB Winter Invitational.

The Gauchos were crowned Big West Tournament Champions for the first time in school history.</p>\n<p>They followed that up with a seventh-place finish in their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance.</p>\n<p>Third-year head coach Serela Kay earned the Big West Coach of the Year honors for the historic performance. The Gauchos have seen a steady improvement each year during her tenure, bringing them into the national spotlight in the sport.</p>\n<p>“I think there’s a change in culture and change in mindset where the players and program show that they can beat anybody in the country,” Kay said. “We’re hosting and competing against some of the best in the country so in order to be the best you need to play the best”</p>\n<p>UCSB is ready to build off the tremendous success from a year ago, but this year the team will look a bit different, as it will be without four of its impact players from last year, all of whom have graduated. Three of its four highest goal scorers are no longer in the picture, making room for the talented core coming up.</p>\n<p>“We did graduate a good nucleus of the team this past year so we have nine new faces on the team,” Kay said. “Six seniors returning from that squad that won the Big West championship.”</p>\n<p>Senior utility Taylor Shore should help in that regard after scoring 46 goals last season while also leading the team in both steals and field blocks. She received a Big West honorable mention for her stellar season. She could be in for a breakout year with the extra opportunity available.</p>\n<p>“Looking at Taylor Shore who is our captain,” Kay said. “She’s really crafty and is a really smart player.”</p>\n<p>Shore is joined by returning players like redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader, senior defender Sophie Trabucco, and senior attacker Brenna Thomas. Schrader was second in goals last year among players who are returning this year. Each of them played all 33 games last year and have plenty of experience to carry on the winning mentality in the program.</p>\n<p>The Big West conference is loaded with talent, with every team somewhere in the top-25 national rankings. UCSB is currently the third-highest ranked Big West school behind only UC Irvine and Hawaii. Four of the Big West schools will be participating in the UCSB Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts No. 22 Cal Baptist this Friday at 12:00 p.m. at Campus Pool. At 4:40 p.m. the Gauchos will return to Campus Pool to face the Indiana Hoosiers. On Saturday, UCSB will face No. 8 Michigan at 12:30 p.m. and Pomona-Pitzer at 2:50 p.m., both at Campus Pool.

Both games have been low scoring defensive battles as UCSB has only scored six goals in their two games against Michigan.</p>\n<p>After only giving up 6.5 goals per game at the Triton Invitational, the Gauchos look primed for revenge in what should be another defensive clash.</p>\n<p>Michigan come at you in many ways as they have five players who have scored over 17 goals this season. UCSB has two such players and has played one less game than Michigan this year.<br>\nA win against Michigan would mean the Gauchos would automatically finish in the top eight at the UCI Invitational. If they lose to Michigan and win the rest of their games, they would finish in ninth place.</p>\n<p>Depending on the result versus Michigan, UCSB will either play Stanford or Cal State Northridge early on Saturday.</p>\n<p>If they win, they would have a good chance of playing Stanford, the top team in the nation, who is undefeated.</p>\n<p>They have truly been dominant this season, only conceding four goals per game while scoring 16 goals per game. In fact, Stanford has never trailed at any point in any game this season.</p>\n<p>The other matchup possibility would be UCSB versus CSUN. Santa Barbara beat CSUN recently at the Triton Invitational 11-6. The Gauchos controlled that game and were the better side throughout the four quarters of play.</p>\n<p>A successful outcome at the UCI Invitational would launch this young team in the right direction as Big West play approaches. In the meantime, the Gauchos are still trying to get better every day.</p>\n<p>“It’s midseason, so right now we’re just trying to get better at the things we have been working on, and then we’ll add to that come conference time,” Kay said. “Right now it’s still defense, counter attack and just kind of the fundamentals.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior utility Miranda Schrader had surgery over the summer and was selected as one of the UCSB performance lifestyle athletes of the week for her hard work in returning to the pool.</p>\n<p>“[Schrader] is fully cleared to play, so it’ll be nice to have her back in the water and have her fill that southpaw role,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>Schrader’s experience and effectiveness will be needed for the Gauchos to make a run in the latter part of this season.</p>\n<p>Another player who is essential to the team’s success is senior utility Taylor Shore, who is putting together another outstanding year leading the team in goals, assists, steals and field blocks this season.</p>\n<p>“Any game, anyone we play, I know she is going to show up and play the same,” Kay said. “That is what we want to call the Gaucho way. It is what we want to be anytime and every time.”</p>\n<p>A player like Shore who can do it all makes it a lot easier on the team as a whole. The 2016 All-Big West honorable mention knows what it takes to be successful late in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin the UCI Invitational when they face No. 8 Michigan at 4:15 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25, at Corona Del Mar High School.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

team, and that means it now turns its attention to single day matches, beginning with a meeting against former MPSF rival, No. 3 Cal.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos head into this home matchup boasting an 8-4 overall record; however, they have been dropping in the national rankings due to losses to Long Beach State and UC Irvine, now ranked sixth and seventh, respectively.</p>\n<p>Cal has had another great start to the year and currently sits at 11-1. The Golden Bears came into this season as the top-ranked team in the nation after winning their 14th national title last season but recently dropped due to a 9-8 loss to UCLA at the MPSF Invitational, finishing third at the tournament. The Gauchos finished ninth in that same invite last weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>History does not bode well for Santa Barbara when facing Cal, continually one of the best programs in Division-I water polo, as it has a career record of 8-67 against the Golden Bears. The last time the Gauchos defeated the defending champs was on Sept. 17, 2004, in a 7-6 double-overtime victory at Cal.</p>\n<p>Recent history has not been so demoralizing, however, as UCSB was within one goal of defeating Cal this year and lost 8-7 at the Triton Invitation in its first weekend of action.</p>\n<p>Hoping to pull off the upset, the Gauchos will be looking to rely on their goal-scoring trio made up of senior Shane Hauschild, junior Boris Jovanovic, and sophomore Ivan Gvozdanovic.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the most experienced and the leader of the team, Hauschild has been the most consistent force for UCSB over his last four years. Over the past three seasons, the attacker has totaled 103 goals, 40 behind the 10th most in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara, Calif. native has scored 17 goals on the year, third-best mark on the team, and scored two against Cal in the first meeting this season, making him the only Gaucho to have multiple goals in that game. He leads the team in steals with 10.</p>\n<p>Jovanovic, a driver, currently is second on the team in goals with 18 and second in total points accumulated with 28 thanks to his 10 assists; he is tied for the best mark on the team with Hauschild.</p>\n<p>Gvozdanovic has been the biggest surprise for the Gauchos this year, as he has been on fire with his team-leading 21 goals on the season and 28 points scored. The utility played in all 26 games last year, scoring 24 goals and earning himself an all-conference honorable mention, but he has much improved from one season to the next, as he is only three goals away from tying last season’s mark.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the Golden Bears definitely have no lack of talent on the offensive side of the ball. While UCSB currently has one goal scorer above 20 on the season, Cal has three of them combining for 73 of the team’s total 163 goals — nearly 45 percent.</p>\n<p>Senior attacker Luca Cupido currently leads the team in scoring with 27 goals on the season, just three short of tying his entire total from last season. Despite that, Cupido made one of the biggest shots in program history as he nailed a long distance strike just before the end of the first overtime in last year’s National Championship match against USC.</p>\n<p>Last season also appeared to be an outlier for the Italian native as he scored 42 and 43 goals in 2014 and 2015, respectively.</p>\n<p>Juniors Odysseas Masmanidis and Johnny Hooper are second and third on the team in goals with 24 and 22, respectively. Hooper has led the team in goals the last two seasons with 74 in 2015 and 75 in 2016.</p>\n<p>With the invitational season finally done, this is the part of the season that will show what this year’s UCSB team is made of. Last year, the Gauchos upset No. 5 Stanford, which helped them eventually get to the No. 4 ranking in the nation, their highest ranking in the polls since 1990.</p>\n<p>One thing is for certain: If Santa Barbara wants to be taken as seriously as it was last year, especially later in the season, it needs signature wins, and what better way to do that than beating a talented program that it hasn’t bested in over a decade?</p>\n<p>No. 8 UCSB takes on No. 3 Cal at noon on Saturday, Sept. 30, at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
