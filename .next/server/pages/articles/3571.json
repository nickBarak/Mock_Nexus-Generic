All around, 18 to 22-year-olds are making their way towards the ocean – specifically, toward Isla Vista’s notorious Del Playa Drive. Even a few blocks away from I.V.’s main drag, the faint buzz of speakers can be heard.</p>\n<p>But first, a cup of coffee. It’s the last Friday of summer for anyone attending Santa Barbara City College, and the sergeant and his accompanying officer know that tonight is going to be a long one.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista, UCSB’s crowded, pint-sized college town is often – and falsely – called the most densely populated neighborhood on the West Coast. Its reputation for debauchery, however, is much more quantifiable: With only approximately 10 percent of the county’s total population, I.V. accounts for roughly 20 percent of serious crimes committed – the vast majority of which are linked to alcohol use.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Raney, curbing the use of alcohol is at the heart of what the IVFP does.</p>\n<p>“If we can control the alcohol, we can help mitigate the serious crimes and accidents [so prominent in I.V.],” Raney says.</p>\n<p><b>Not-so-medical Marijuana</b></p>\n<p>The quick jerk of the man’s hand toward his back pocket immediately catches the attention of the patrolling officers. He might as well have just walked up and told the cops he was doing something illegal.</p>\n<p>It’s 10:55 p.m. and Sgt. Raney asks the man what he just put in his back pocket. Unfortunately for this second year SBCC student, playing dumb is not going to work. Sgt. Raney suspects it may be a bag of cocaine he stuffed into his pocket (an automatic arrest), so he places the man in handcuffs and asks him again, “What’s in your pocket?”</p>\n<p>Seeing that there is no way out, the man confesses, “A gram of marijuana.”</p>\n<p>The handcuffs are removed and he is told to sit on the curb. Sgt. Raney writes out the citation for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, a misdemeanor offense that’s going to cost the toker a little more than $100.</p>\n<p>Trying to make light of the situation, the young man tells the officers he doesn’t even have a pipe to smoke his recently purchased weed.</p>\n<p>“I just figured I’d pick that up later,” he says.</p>\n<p><b>A Captain’s Tale</b></p>\n<p>“I don’t think that’s legal,” yells a reveler socializing in front of a party on oceanside Del Playa Drive. “That’s private property!”</p>\n<p>The sheriff pays him no mind and continues down the side alley, making his way toward the balcony jutting precariously out over the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>“Even if it is private property, if it’s an open party or can be viewed from the street, we have the right to enter,” Sgt. Raney says as he passes onto the property.</p>\n<p>There, unaware of his imminent arrival, are five underage drinkers enjoying the sound of the waves and the comforting warmth of Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum. There are not many places where college students have it so good, but with the pros come the cons.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take the officers long to determine that none of the revelers are of age. However, some insist on trying to talk their way out of it, swearing that the half-drunk beers that sit directly between their feet are not theirs.</p>\n<p>Caught red-handed, however, nobody is getting out of it. All five watch as their Minor in Possessions – the most common of citations according to Sgt. Raney – are written out and their booze is poured onto the ground.</p>\n<p>One, however, is adamant about talking his way out trouble, insisting he is a good guy and that he isn’t drunk at all. Sgt. Raney agrees he is no doubt a good guy, but keeps filling out the paperwork.</p>\n<p>With the yellow citation in hand – an approximate $150 ticket plus the cost of the drug awareness classes most opt for – the young man changes gears and tries to salvage what is left of the night.</p>\n<p>“If you were honestly cool cops, you’d let me drink that beer right now,” the 19-year-old says, referring to the nearly full forty of Miller Genuine Draft sitting at his feet. Without uttering a word, the accompanying officer picks up the beer and pours it out onto the cement.</p>\n<p><b>May I Recommend a Bush?</b></p>\n<p>There are a definite drawbacks to heavy drinking (a killer hangover, a bad decision or two, not remembering if you made a bad decision or two) but few are more prevalent – or urgent – than the need to urinate.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, you just can’t find that necessary toilet.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, a trip into one of Isla Vista’s many parks could be an (illegal) necessity, but pissing on the side of building in view of the street is never a good idea.</p>\n<p>It’s 12:50 a.m. and Sgt. Raney catches a glimpse of a man making just that mistake.</p>\n<p>Upon noticing the sheriff, he instinctively grabs his phone and makes like he was busy texting, only his phone is locked and the screen remains blank.</p>\n<p>The man is asked to sit on the curb, and while the officer is filling out the citation, a resident of the apartment comes out to vouch for the man.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of my very good friends,” she tells Sgt. Raney.</p>\n<p>“Did he have permission to pee on the side of your apartment?” Raney asks with a slight smile, but receives no answer.</p>\n<p>The man is cited for breaking a county ordinance, the lesser of two possible citations. Had he been especially rude, Raney says, he could have received the more severe penalty, which carries with it a fine of over $700.</p>\n<p><b>867-5309</b></p>\n<p>It’s 1:05 a.m. and the streets of Isla Vista are still crowded, albeit more intoxicated than a few hours earlier. Sgt. Raney and his fellow officer are standing in the shadows along Del Playa Drive, waiting for something to catch their attention.</p>\n<p>A young female, clearly intoxicated, stumbles by, holding on to a young man who doesn’t appear to be a good friend. Sgt. Raney stops the pair and asks to talk with the young lady.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney asks if she knows her male counterpart, and she tells him that they met tonight. Her accent tells him that she is not a native to Isla Vista, and he asks her where she is staying. The young Swedish woman points back and says, “the house with the dolphins on it.”</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney believes she is too drunk to take care of herself and, for her own safety, does not want to leave her with her newly acquired friend. He asks her if she has any other friends with her and she shakes her head, but offers to call them.</p>\n<p>The sheriff agrees, and she tries a few numbers without success, until finally reaching a friend. Sgt. Raney takes the phone from her, introduces himself and tells the young woman’s friend, “Come and get your friend, so she doesn’t go to jail.”</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, a gaggle of girls shows up and leads the young Swede away.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to protect an intoxicated woman strolling down the street with a random guy,” Raney says later. Had her friends not shown up, he says, he would have had to arrest her for public intoxication, which can have potentially serious ramifications and almost always includes a night in jail.</p>\n<p><b>Pending Sobriety</b></p>\n<p>The moon is sinking beneath the western horizon and the streets are starting to finally clear out. It’s nearly two in the morning and the fervor from hours past is starting to wane.</p>\n<p>Standing at the corner of DP and El Embarcadero, a number of the deputies congregate to discuss the night’s events, but none can help but notice when a highly intoxicated female stumbles out into the middle of street carrying her shoes in one hand and dropping her phone with the other.</p>\n<p>Two officers immediately make their way toward her, and watch as she attempts to pick up her phone, only to drop one of her shoes. The officers walk up to her and tell her to stop, but she brushes them off and continues walking, saying, “I’m not drinking.”</p>\n<p>One of the officers grabs her arm, and directs her to the curb. They ask her for her age and she tells them she’s 21. Her demeanor is combative, and she attempts to stand up, but is quickly reprimanded. She is asked her age again.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-four,” is her new answer. The deputy tells her she just gave two separate answers and she says, “I’m 23.”</p>\n<p>The officers stand her up and slap handcuffs on her. She continues to tell them that she’s not drunk, but her appeals fall on deaf ears. The deputies arrest her for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p>(An easy way to avoid this fate is to always walk with someone and never give the police a reason to stop you. Stumbling down the street and repeatedly dropping your belongings are dead giveaways.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the young lady acted unwisely and has to pay the consequences. After a few moments, a patrol car picks her up and transports her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she is housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/","id":3571,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3570,3569,3568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[3554,3571,3752,3825,3827,3828,3829,3830,3831,3833,3835,3842,3887,3902,3903,3905,3906],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Five Years… and Counting","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For Maj.

Tasked with deposing the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and protecting the United States and her allies from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, the invasion force swiftly routed the Iraqi army.</p>\n<p>Seventy-six hundred miles away, back on our sunny campus, the war was the talk of the town. At least 1,000 UCSB students and staff members participated in a worldwide walkout, marching out of class and into Storke Plaza on March 5, 2003. In the coming weeks, rallies would continue on and off campus, and the pages of this paper’s opinion section would be stuffed with columns and letters about the prudence of preemption.</p>\n<p>However, five years later, some, like former marine-turned-political-activist Dave Hassan, have come to believe that the U.S. has separated itself from the situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>“It’s really easy to just not be connected and just kind of being like, you know, ‘that sucks'” Hassan said. “The big difference between five years is, I guess, I’m connected.”</p>\n<p>Hassan – who has become vocal in the local peace movement since finishing his time in the Marine Corps as an Arabic translator – said that while he understands how Americans can push the war to the back of their minds, he said that “war is too fucking terrible for [him] to sit by.”</p>\n<p>“I think what really changed it for me was gaining a real sort of conception of what [doing my job as a Marine] really meant,” Hassan said. “When I saw people actually die, it really changed it for me. It shook me up. … I never actually shot anyone, but I have been responsible for people dying in the course of my job, and being responsible for that … actually changed my whole opinion. Gaining an actual connection to the Iraqi people. That’s what changed.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos in the Gulf</p>\n<p>Since 2003, UCSB’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps has sent between 40 and 50 graduates to the Middle East. And in those five years since the Iraq War began, Major Mike Salvo of UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion is proud to say that none of his cadets were wounded or killed.</p>\n<p>The ROTC program trains students throughout their time at the university and commissions cadets as 2nd lieutenants upon graduation. UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion Business Manager and Military Historian Patrick Coffield said last year was a great year for the program. The program commissioned 14 cadets as officers in the United States Army.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of UCSB ROTC graduates will see combat in the Middle East, Coffield said. He and Major Salvo estimated that 70 to 90 percent of graduates from the program find their way into combat situations.</p>\n<p>When asked about last year’s graduating class and why the service had received such a surge in enlistees, Coffield told this reporter to “Do the math.”</p>\n<p>Five years ago  – when the recent graduates were college freshmen – the memory of 9/11 was much more poignant, Major Salvo said, and the United States had just entered a war against one of the most maligned nations in the world.</p>\n<p>“People wanted to serve our country,” Coffield said.</p>\n<p>Brett Jordan, a 24-year-old native of Redondo Beach and 2006 UCSB grad, was part of that influx of students looking to serve their country. After four years of ROTC on campus, Jordan was trained for an additional six months and is now on his eighth month of service in the Anbar Province of Iraq.</p>\n<p> “My class was the first class to join post-9/11,” Jordan said. “We started school in 2002, so all of our class was the one that went in knowing ‘hey, we will definitely be going over there at some point.’ … A little daunting, but still good.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ROTC enrollment numbers are tapering down, however, and Coffield said he expects nine cadets to graduate this summer and another five the year after. Nationally, U.S. military recruitment is also declining, according to Department of Defense undersecretary David S. C. Chu.</p>\n<p>The seeming permanence of the war in Iraq, a negative view of military life and even the rising obesity rates – the military rejects a third of its applicants because of its physical fitness standards – were all cited as likely explanations for the decline.</p>\n<p>From Anbar, Two Different Views of the World</p>\n<p>Hassan and Lt. Jordan both served in the Anbar Province of Iraq. Jordan is currently stationed at al-Asad Air Base- the largest base in al-Anbar – and leads a truck company that drives freight liners packed with supplies throughout Iraq. Hassan was stationed at al-Asad a little more than two years ago, but spent most of his time in local towns.</p>\n<p>In Anbar, those two years made all the difference.</p>\n<p>Before September 2006, the region was famed for its violence, lawlessness and the harrowing battle of Fallujah. Since then, according to the New York Times, local Sunni tribes have come together to work with the U.S. military to oppose militant al-Qaeda operatives. The province is now one of the most stable in Iraq. Jordan agrees with the Times’ assessment and called it “one of the safest areas right now.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, who was stationed at al-Asad Air Base but spent most of his time in the cities of Al-Rutbah and Hit, described a different Anbar Province.</p>\n<p>“While I was there, there were a lot of attacks and we were in the process of leveling the place,” Hassan said. “We were bombing the shit out of the place.”</p>\n<p>Whether there is any correlation, both have come out of Iraq with very different feelings about America’s presence in the Middle Eastern nation.</p>\n<p>“We went in there and removed a government that wasn’t doing some things and the country needed help,” Jordan said. “When people say ‘no war, no war’, you know, war’s not fun. It never has been. But its necessary to do at times.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, on the other hand, said that he does not believe America’s presence in Iraq has or will help the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>“What exactly is the end state we’re going for [in Iraq]?” Hassan said. “We empower death squads and war lords. … In what possible state of scenarios does that lead to democracy in Iraq?”</p>\n<p>Buried in Sand</p>\n<p>Generally, in Santa Barbara, the debate is similar. But the question of whether or not American boots on the ground in Iraq can salvage the country, naturally, has no exact answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s tears in a lot of people,” Michael “the Chaplain” Cervantes said yesterday at Arlington West. “They just don’t want to talk.”</p>\n<p>Cervantes – who is not a priest, but was dubbed “the Chaplain” by his fellow volunteer veterans because of his open ears – said mournful visitors from around the world tend to hold their hearts as they stand and look over the 3,000 small, white crosses planted onto the beach next to Stearns Wharf in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Michael Moore, a serviceman stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, said he believes the U.S. is “doing the right thing.” Holding his infant son yesterday while gazing upon the sea of crosses next to Stearns Wharf, Moore said he was touched by the memorial.</p>\n<p>“It brings tears to my eyes,” he said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers from the local chapter of Veterans for Peace set up the 3,000 crosses almost every Sunday morning to represent the lives lost in Iraq. Stephen Sherrill, the mastermind behind the project and the craftsman behind each cross, said when he started, the memorial had only 287 crosses.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/","id":3568,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3567,3566,3565],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Halloween Polls","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Check out the Nexus on the week of the 25th for a series on the history of Halloween in IV and Halloween 2010.

Oh, and sex columns scare the crap out of them.<br>\n2) Albino raccoons are invading Isla Vista.

The Daily Nexus got a front-page makeover, feature stories and a science page; our Web site got ads, videos and comment boards; UCTV made a documentary about us; we had some amazing news coverage – hello, does Hillary Clinton ring a bell? – and we took home several awards, including the honor of being named one of the top three college newspapers in the state.

Oh, who am I kidding. I can’t stay mad at you. You’ve done some great work with the layout this year and, holy cow, you revived the science section! Kudos, my friend.</p>\n<p>Lauren Crecelius: You are one of the most reliable people in the office. It’s been a relief to have you on the team. You are not only a fantastic editor, but a true friend.</p>\n<p>Travis Miller and Evan Wagstaff: T-Mills, you’ll always be in my heart and on my desktop, and Evan, you have a beautiful voice. Both of you have really pulled through this year and I thank you kindly. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran: I can’t believe you are hanging around I.V. for another year. I’m warning freshmen parents about you. Seriously, though, you have led your news desk to glory this year and we’ve had some awesome times together. I have no regrets.</p>\n<p>Jessica Mullen and Mackenzie Weinger: You write some amazing and well-researched stories and it’s always fun to watch you get excited. I am so very proud of you two and I will miss you both. Give ’em hell.</p>\n<p>Erin Currie: I thought we fired you! Ok, ok. You can keep your job. Erin, I think it’s fair to say that you are one of the nicest and most humble persons in this office. Please, don’t change!</p>\n<p>Patty Bobek and C.K. Hickey : You always come into work with a smile on your faces and you’ve handled some difficult situations with the opinion page this past year. Patty, you’ve truly encouraged me to always do more and, C.K., I suspect you are Superman, but I guess I’ll never know … I put Kryptonite in your hookah.</p>\n<p>Chris Hoffman and Alex Pavlovic: If there’s anything I’ll remember, it’s Chris’s mischievous grin and Alex’s sly-guy wit. You have rocked the world of sports this year and your columns kick ass. Call me when you make it to ESPN.</p>\n<p>Mollie Vandor and Tyler Vickers: The woman who takes shit from no one and the nicest guy in the office. You two are truly a force to be reckoned with. You guys know what you want and you take it.</p>\n<p>Erin Saldana and Rickey Mizuno: Where’s Erin? I can’t find Erin? Oh, there she is. As our pint-sized photographer you took some beautiful shots this year, and Rickey, you were always there for us when we needed you. You also make a damn fine drink. With that, I leave you with Erin’s favorite word: Chupacabra.</p>\n<p>Simon Estrada and Rick Martinez: You are so damned talented. Every time I find a piece of art I like in the paper, it usually tends to be yours, and I like the way you push your artists to excel. I see great things in your future.</p>\n<p>Valerie Tidwell, Melissa Davis, Noel Woodward, Rachel Lorencz, Virginia Yapp, and the rest of Copy: I regret that I do not have enough space to give thanks to each and every one of you. Please know that your willingness to endure some of those late nights has always left me in awe of you all.</p>\n<p>Kelly O’Halloran and Kera Zacuto: You guys made On the Menu the best section it could possibly be. Never has this section looked so beautiful. I thank you very much for you hard work.</p>\n<p>Nicki Arnold: You are too cool and I was lucky to have you by my side when I was opinion editor. I’m so glad you came back this year. You are the little sister I always wish I had.</p>\n<p>Nikki Moore, Craig Calkins and Dana Olsen: You guys may have left your desks a little early, but you never left my mind. It’s been fun growing up with you at the Nexus and I hope to run into you again post-graduation.</p>\n<p>Dan Gruen, Ryan Moll, Steve Placial: Video guys! You have helped make our vision a reality. You have formed the basis of what will likely become an integral part of the Web site. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>Barb MacLean and J.E. Anderson: You have been my guiding lights over the past four years and you have contributed to this paper far more than you can imagine. You two are the hardest-working people we have.</p>\n<p>Jerry Roberts, Linda Meyer and Carol Dermer: I don’t know how you do it, but you do it with style. Thanks for balancing our books and selling those ads. I have a feeling the future looks very bright for the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, David Ferry: You have a lot of potential, my friend. If you stay focused, you’ll more than likely outdo your predecessors as editor in chief, and I expect that you will. Thus, I leave you with the words that I was given upon taking the paper’s top spot: A year from now, this will all seem funny.</p>\n<p>Adios, amigos!</p>\n<p>–Nick Dürnhöfer<br>\n–Daily Nexus<br>\n–Editor in Chief 2007-2008</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16869\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16869\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-19/the-trail-needs-dusting-a-nexus-goodbye/","id":3570,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3569,3568,3567],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
