Helping solidify UCSB’s frontcourt as of recently has been sophomore forwards Chaya Durr and Taylor Farris.</p>\n<p>In back-to-back games, Farris has played over 30 minutes and scored in double-figures, finishing with 14 points on Thursday. It was a solid outing for Durr as she earned her first career double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds to go with four steals.</p>\n<p>It was a compelling victory for UCSB as it ended a nine-game losing streak to Cal Poly, its first victory against the program since March 5, 2011. The Gauchos had not beat the Mustangs in the Thunderdome since Feb. 27 2010.</p>\n<p>“It’s the best thing for the kids, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “This is the best thing for the players, the fans and the program. The best thing is in the locker room. Just to watch them smile, laugh and celebrate is the best part. And, it’s a rival game so it’s even better.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s win improved the Gauchos’ overall record to 4-11, 1-0 to start conference play. Cal Poly is now at the .500 mark with a 7-7 overall and 0-1 Big West record.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded baskets to begin the game, but a 6-0 UCSB run gave it a chance to distance itself from Cal Poly at a lead of 15-8. The trading of buckets continued as a jump shot by sophomore guard Dynn Leaupepe brought Cal Poly within three at 15-18. However, a three-pointer off the bank of the backboard by freshman guard Coco Miller ended the first quarter with the Gauchos up, 21-15.</p>\n<p>Miller’s long distance make was the start of an 11-0 run that flourished in the beginning of the second quarter, forming into a 29-15 Santa Barbara lead. A jump shot by senior point guard Lisa Marie Sanchez brought Cal Poly within single-figures at 29-20, but the Gauchos went on to enter halftime with a 38-20 lead.</p>\n<p>Setting up UCSB’s lead was its stellar defense in the first half. It held Cal Poly to a 34.6 shooting percentage and strayed away from sending the Mustangs to the free throw line, not allowing any attempts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos recorded 11 steals in the first half, their most in a half this season. Their tremendous defense resulted in Cal Poly scoring just five points in the second quarter as UCSB held the Mustangs scoreless from the 5:23 mark to the closing of the period.</p>\n<p>“Our best offense was our defense,” Henrickson said. “It helped us that Poly played like some teams we had played, so it wasn’t a whole different scheme, offensively and defensively. It’s contagious when you start making shots. But, in the huddles all we kept talking about was our defense. That’s what got us going, that’s where you get juice and momentum.”</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t let up in the second half, responding with back-to-back three-pointers by Roper and Miller.  However, the Mustangs turned to a full-court press defense in the second half in hopes of making a comeback. To Cal Poly’s benefit, the press worked as UCSB turned the ball over 18 times in the second half to conclude with a total of 27 on the night.</p>\n<p>“Give them [Cal Poly] credit,” Henrickson said. “They’re not a pressing team, but they had to do that to get back in it. We didn’t attack that as aggressively as they attacked us.”</p>\n<p>The improvement on defense led to Cal Poly cutting UCSB’s lead as junior forward Hannah Gilbert guided the Mustangs back from behind. For the second consecutive game, she registered another 20-point game with 22 points on 9-13 shooting and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Still, Santa Barbara earned its largest lead of 51-22 in the third quarter, but saw it diminish in the fourth quarter as the Mustangs managed to trim the Gauchos’ lead to a 10-point deficit of 65-55 with 4:40 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Bringing UCSB’s lead to such a deficit was Cal Poly’s Sanchez, whose scoring outburst of three-straight three-pointers sparked the Mustangs’ 11-0 run. Sanchez finished with 15 points on a 60 percent shooting effort and 3-5 shooting from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly outscored Santa Barbara 34-18 in the final quarter. Down 10, sustaining the Mustangs’ possible comeback was UCSB’s poor free throw shooting in the fourth quarter. The Gauchos shot 4-13 at the line, but were relieved of their free throw woes by a Roper three-pointer which handed UCSB a 68-55 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite the Mustangs’ scoring surge to end the game, their improvement in performance came too late as their 26 turnovers had delayed their offense earlier in the game. Some late baskets would allow Cal Poly to reduce the Gauchos’ lead, but it never managed to get within single-figures again and was defeated 78-67.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain at home for its next conference game versus UC Riverside on Saturday, Jan. 9 at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67254\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67254\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/78-67-ending-seals-conference-opening-win-for-ucsb-in-blue-green-rivalry/","id":385,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[384,383,382],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry to Start Big West Play for UCSB on Thursday, Continues with UCR on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The non-conference schedule is wrapped up and conference play has arrived!

Cal Poly is also in search of its 10<sup>th</sup> consecutive win against Santa Barbara.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB continues its home stand with a matchup versus UC Riverside on Saturday. The Highlanders are 7-7, but have a losing record on the road of 3-6. While Riverside last played on Saturday, both UCSB and Cal Poly should be well rested having not played in over a week.</p>\n<p>“It’s been nice to have this much practice time to clean up things,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Sometimes when you play so frequently and don’t get enough practice, you get game slippage. We’ve just got to work on us, honestly.”</p>\n<p>Due to the indefinite ineligibility of freshman forward Kali Jones, UCSB has been forced to play with a smaller lineup. However, in three games without Jones, the Gauchos have surpassed their season average of 35.9 rebounds per game with an average of 47.6. They are 2-1 and have outrebounded each of its opponents, recording consecutive season-highs of 49 versus La Verne and a season-best 58 versus Morehead St.</p>\n<p>While UCSB seems to have established its presence on the boards, it will be tested in the paint by Cal Poly’s junior forward Hannah Gilbert. Despite the graduation of former two-time All-Big West First Team selection, guard Ariana Elegado, Gilbert has embraced a bigger role as the Mustangs have become more active in getting the ball in the paint.</p>\n<p>Her 52.6 field goal percentage led the Big West last season and she currently leads the conference in rebounding with an average of 9.6 boards per game, ranking 35<sup>th</sup> in the nation in addition to being second on the team in scoring, averaging 12.2 ppg. Gilbert also is atop the conference in double-doubles with five on the season and recently earned Big West Player of the Week honors for achieving career-highs in points and rebounds with 23 and 17. Her career night helped Cal Poly break its single-game school record for rebounds with a total of 74, surpassing the former record of 67.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s physicality and ability to consistently box out in the paint will be key in denying the Mustangs of having an advantage on the boards.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s matchup versus UC Riverside on Saturday will be the end of a four-game home stretch before heading back onto the road. Santa Barbara looks to end another losing streak this weekend as it has loss the last three meetings to Riverside.</p>\n<p>In order to prevent a fourth-straight loss, the Gauchos must contain UCR’s lethal scoring offense. The Highlanders lead the Big West in points per game (73.6), field goal percentage (43.6), assists per game (18.6- 11<sup>th</sup> nationally), free throw percentage (72.7), three-point percentage (35.1- 49<sup>th</sup> nationally) and commit the fewest turnovers with an average of 15.4 per game.</p>\n<p>In addition to its No. 11 national ranking in assists per game, Riverside ranks seventh in the country in total assists with 260 this season while ranking 23<sup>rd</sup> with a 1.21 assists turnover ratio.</p>\n<p>The share of wealth on offense lands three Highlanders — senior guards Brittany Crain and Annelise Ito as well as redshirt junior forward Réjane Verin— within the top five scorers of the Big West.</p>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that the reigning Big West Player of the Year in Crain is atop the conference in scoring (17.6 ppg)  after ranking 11<sup>th</sup> in the nation and first in the Big West in points per game last season with an average of 21.7. She also ranks fifth in the Big West in three-point percentage at 36.6 percent.</p>\n<p>Ahead of Crain by a margin of .03 is UNLV transfer and former Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year, Verin, who’s 17.9 ppg leads the conference while she also ranks second in field goal percentage (49.5) and fourth in rebounds per game (7.9).</p>\n<p>In the team’s last game against Grand Canyon University, Crain and Verin both recorded double-double performances of 20 points and 10 rebounds, a milestone that hadn’t been achieved by a pair of UCR players since 2013.</p>\n<p>Completing the Highlanders trio of scoring alongside Crain in the backcourt is Ito. Her averages of 12.8 ppg and 7.1 rebounds per game ranks fifth in the Big West while she leads the team’s foundation of assists with an average of 4.9 per game which stands second in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCR is loaded on the offensive end, which will call for a big game from UCSB’s top scorers in sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Roper leads the Gauchos in scoring at an average of 12.1 ppg while Miller is second on the team at 9.2 ppg. Both are tied for the team lead in most games with double figures scored at seven while Roper has the edge of one game over Miller for most 20-point games at three.</p>\n<p>If Roper and Miller can manage to stay engaged and provide UCSB with scoring on offense throughout an entirety of four quarters, the Gauchos may be able to close out their conference opening weekend with a victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s conference opener will be Henrickson’s introduction to the Big West after spending just over a decade at the University of Kansas. Although the Big West isn’t one of the powerhouse conferences like the Big 12, Henrickson maintains the same mentality despite the change in conference.</p>\n<p>“I have great respect for the Big West,” she said. “You have quality coaches. I appreciate and respect teams that play the game it’s supposed to be played. This time of the year, you either get better or you get worse, nobody stays the same. It’d be a disservice and disrespectful if I coached them [UCSB] any differently.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest versus Cal Poly will begin at 7:00 p.m. while Saturday’s game on Jan. 9 versus UC Riverside will take place at 4:00 p.m. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67198\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67198\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/","id":382,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[381,380,379],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Remains Winless on the Road, Lose 65-55 at UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos fell to 0-8 on the road over the weekend after losing at the Highlanders and also fall to 1-4 in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_75077\" style=\"width: 615px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75077\" data-attachment-id=\"75077\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/maxwell-kupchak-moves-the-ball-down-the-court-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Maxwell Kupchak moves the ball down the court.

Compare that to UCR’s 45.5 percent (25-55) from the field and it’s no shock as to why the home team won the matchup. Even with winning the rebounding battle at 41-36 and shooting much better from the free-throw line, Santa Barbara as a team was not as efficient from the field as UC Riverside, resulting in its eighth road loss of the year.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders were leading for most of the first half behind the great play of senior guard Malik Thames, who had nine points on 4-5 shooting. Luckily for the Gauchos, Vincent was also clutch in the first half with 11 points, including two three-pointers and scoring his 1,000th career point in his career as a Gaucho, becoming only the 28th player in school history to accomplish this feat.</p>\n<p>With the score tied at 25 with only 1:20 left in the first frame, Childress knocked down two FT’s to give his team a 27-25 lead. However, Santa Barbara then conceded seven straight points before the end of the half, including three by Thames, to go down 32-27 at the break.</p>\n<p>After retaking the lead late in the first half, the Highlanders never looked back, keeping the score in their favor until the end of the match. In stretches during which it played good defense, UCSB was unable to knock down a shot to really cut into the lead and threaten UCR. In the second half, Santa Barbara shot only 28.1 percent from the field while UC Riverside shot 48.1 percent. UCSB was able to stay in the game due to its ability to get to the line, where it shot 9-12 in the half.</p>\n<p>The last great chance the Gauchos had to make this a game was with 6:44 left in the contest. After two made free-throws by junior forward Alex Hart making the score 53-47, UCSB forced a turnover and had three solid looks at cutting the lead to four, its lowest margin since early in the second half, but were unable to capitalize. UCR scored on the next possession and finished the Gauchos off 65-55.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 55-point night was the second lowest point total of the season, with its worst being a loss at UC Davis 73-47. UCSB seems to be its own worst enemy in nights like these, forcing shots that are not there while also missing open shots that should result in points.</p>\n<p>Despite solid first-half performances, Childress only managed two second-half points, while Vincent did put up a solid seven but on a very inefficient 3-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>This season has been very tough for the Gauchos, but with over 10 games left in Big West play, they cannot afford to give up just yet. This UCSB team has shown flashes of greatness in its win over Cal Poly and even in some tough losses like at LBSU.</p>\n<p>With a team that has such potential and still has the third leading scorer in the conference in Vincent, this team is capable of making a run; it just needs a bit of a push.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against CSUN at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 25 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

For the first time since 2012, UCSB will be starting the season without center Alan Williams and point guard Zalmico Harmon, who both graduated last year.</p>\n<p>In his two years with UCSB, Harmon was one of the conference’s most efficient point guards, leading the Big West with a 4.6 assist to turnover ratio in 2013-14 and ranking fourth in 2014-15 with a 2.2 ratio.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a short stint with the Houston Rockets in the NBA Summer League, Williams made the move to the Chinese Basketball Association to play for the Qingdao Double Star Eagles. He leaves behind huge shoes to fill after finishing as UCSB’s all-time leader in rebounds and second all-time leader in scoring.</p>\n<p>Even though they have to replace two key starters, the Gauchos received 161 points in the Big West Preseason Coaches’ Poll, predicting a second place finish behind only UC Irvine. After a 72-63 overtime win in the Big West Semifinals, the Anteaters went on to win the conference and earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Despite the lineup changes, UCSB will not be without strong leadership this season. Senior guard Michael Bryson was named to the Big West All-First Team after averaging 13.9 points per game in 2014-15, good for ninth best in the conference. His career point total of 1,043 is the most among active Big West players, helping make him the only Gaucho voted to the Big West Preseason All-Conference team.</p>\n<p>Alongside Bryson, senior guard John Green has overcome a series of injuries throughout his collegiate career to establish himself as one of the best players on the team. After missing all but four games from 2011-2014, Green played all 33 games in 2015 while averaging the third most points per game on the team at 11.3 on an impressive 47.7 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent will have an increased role in the backcourt with the absence of Harmon. In just his first year with the Gauchos, Vincent averaged 10.1 points and 2.1 assists per game while knocking down 57 three pointers, the second most by a freshman in program history.</p>\n<p>UCSB added a handful of freshmen in the offseason, including point guard Grant Troutt from Episcopal School of Dallas and forward Jarriese Blackmon.</p>\n<p>Troutt averaged 12 points, five assists and two rebounds in his junior year and impressed scouts with his play in the AAU circuit to earn a spot with UCSB. He will join a crowded backcourt that already has several other point guards including junior Eric Childress and senior T.J. Taylor. Similar to last year, Head Coach Bob Williams may plan to use different combinations which utilize three or four point guards throughout the season.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Blackmon was Utah’s Player of the Year, leading his team to the state championship tournament with averages of 16.7 points, 10.7 rebounds and over two assists, blocks and steals per game. At 6’6”, 210 pounds, he is a combo forward that can make an impact early for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Finally, forward Ami Lakoju will have his chance to shine after missing the majority of last season. The redshirt freshman collapsed during practice last December and was shut down for the remainder of the year, but has made progress since then and should play a huge part for the Gauchos as they look to replace Williams, their top player from the last few seasons.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s season-opening exhibition against San Francisco State tips off this Sunday at 5:30 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66142\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66142\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/mens-basketball-set-for-first-tip-off-in-post-big-al-era/","id":384,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[383,382,381],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
