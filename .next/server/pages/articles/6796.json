The streetlights illuminated couples, friends and acquaintances, all making their way to the next restaurant, bar or both. Everyone was ready to find some escape this President’s Day weekend. SOhO’s signature brick walls enclosed a full house that night, it’s patrons eagerly awaiting to see Citizen Cope (Clarence Greenwood) perform his <em>With Love</em> compilation. The compilation is a journey through Cope’s discography starting from the nineties till now. A majority of the crowd appeared to be older than your average UCSB student, all die hard lovers of his music.</p>\n<p>Daniel Vasquez, the manager of the club that night who had seen Citizen Cope some time before, assured me that this would be an enjoyable performance. He also mentioned that Cope was very particular about how his audience behaves during his sets. Apparently, he has been known to walk off the stage due to rambunctious crowds. This explained all of the signs posted around the venue asking its patrons to be respectful toward the solo act that night.</p>\n<p>The request appeared strange at first; however, the crowd worked as one so as to maintain a certain level of peace. Citizen Cope walked on stage to great applause, his warm smile drawing the remainder of the restaurant to the stage. Bathed in blue, red and purple light, Citizen Cope began his set, treating spectators to the solemn and gentle chords from his guitar. Cope’s music jumps between genres, sometimes lying directly in between two. He will blend and borrow from various styles and make them his own. His <em>With Love</em> compilation showcases his talents in playing blues, rock, hip hop and more.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Citizen Cope delivered Friday night, his voice adding a degree of authenticity and soul to his past works. With each part of his set, Cope channeled the pain and moments of love present in his lyrics. The crowd quietly sang along and swayed with their significant others, possibly remembering past relations or happy romances. Who knows? With songs like “Salvation” and “Bullet and a Target,” one experiences a darker side to the narratives Cope wrote into his songs. The disco ball overhead swayed slowly, reflecting the stage lights through the rafters of the venue. Through the haze of purple, the crowd danced slowly along to the steady rhythm of Cope’s set. It was an amusing sight when fans shushed pockets of patrons of the louder variety as the next song began, most likely to ensure the best show possible. As a collective, spectators cheered as Cope began performing favorite after favorite. “Let the Drummer Kick” had Cope playing alongside a recorded beat and piano melody; he jokingly said to the crowd, “This next acoustic song is gonna have some accompaniment with some tape. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to play it, and I know all of you want to hear it.” The crowd responded ecstatically as a bass kick and snare hit shook the venue, bodies moving to the steady hiss of a hi-hat.</p>\n<p>Citizen Cope returned for an encore to a still-packed venue. The cheers called Cope back to the stage for a few more songs to close out the night. “Hurricane Waters” had the audience participate by clapping along to the beat, echoing “I will carry you” and “hurricane waters.” The crowd’s voice bounced across the walls, creating a serene moment between them and Cope at the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Citizen Cope brought an intense mixture of blues, rock and hip hop to SOhO. His voice complimented the bluesy scales, it’s accent almost morphing away from the west coast to something more mid-western or southern. Cope finished up a fantastic show, bringing out love and a whole box of other emotions for the venue to experience — definitely an appropriate start to the three day weekend and Valentine’s Day.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68369\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68369\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/","id":6796,"author":{"id":724,"name":"Vincent Beck"},"related":[6795,6794,6793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":724,"name":"Vincent Beck","biography":"Not available","articles":[6796,6832],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Chainsmokers Tackle Earl Warren Showgrounds","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Chainsmokers_by-McLane-Brown-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Chainsmokers_by-McLane-Brown-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Earl Warren Showgrounds became a playground for Gauchos on Tuesday for the highly anticipated, sold-out Chainsmokers show.

The event was put together as a collaborative effort between the Chainsmokers and a new app called Tilt. Campuses were challenged to pre-sell 800 tickets and the first six schools to do so won a spot on the Tilt Tour. The headliner of the show wasn’t announced until 24 hours before tickets went on sale. UCSB managed to sell out the first round of tickets in less than an hour and half, and the second release in under a minute.</p>\n<p>Tilt is an app that makes it easy to collect money without all the hassle. Basically, a user starts a Tilt campaign with a set “Tilt amount.” Others donate whatever sum they choose, but nobody gets charged until the goal is hit. It’s like Venmo on a Costco-sized scale. The appeal to college campuses is obvious. Whether it’s a party, a trip, philanthropy or day-to-day housing costs, Tilt can make any type of organizing as smooth as can be. Overall, this Tilt campaign managed to sell more than 4,800 tickets in less than two hours, a clear example of the app’s accessibility and efficiency.</p>\n<p>The event itself was a huge success. The crowd managed to fill up the hall regardless of the early show time. Set times were strictly adhered to, and security was very efficient. The opening act vibed well with the excitement of the audience and paved the way for the headliner. Austin Graham, fourth-year chemical engineering major, told me he’s seen The Chainsmokers more times than he can count, but “they still manage to get me ridiculously hyped every time.” During the set another concert go-er, fourth-year economics major Chris Mulvihill, told me that he’s “so glad he skipped studying to come see this event.” Chainsmokers over midterms erryday, amirite?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Crowd-funding concerts and tours might be the future of how artists tour. Earlier this year, <em>The New York Times </em>published an article discussing the feasibility of saving musicians revenue with the emergence of prominent streaming services such as Spotify or SoundCloud. A cost of touring that is often overlooked is the wear and tear such a hectic schedule takes on the artists themselves. <em>The New York Times </em>discusses how unsustainable of a business model touring is for artists, especially when record label contracts are considered. Record labels use artist’s independent contractor statuses to release themselves from liabilities pertaining to the well-being of the artist.</p>\n<p>The changes happening in the music industry force artists to adapt. In an interview with <em>The Rolling Stone</em>, Foo Fighters front man Dave Grohl said that crowd funding might be the future of how artists plan their tours. The Foo Fighters had to cancel a huge part of their 2015 tour due to an injury Grohl sustained while performing. <em>The New York Times </em>reports that the canceled shows cost the band about $10 million — a sum that is very difficult to recover. An alternative needs to be found to sustain the music industry. The Chainsmokers see things similarly. The duo told Tilt, “We are seeing so much innovation nowadays, and we don’t think the way people attend concerts is any different. As artists especially, we want to go to the markets we have the most demand.”</p>\n<p>Another reason The Chainsmokers might have been attracted to Tilt could be how both Tilt and the dynamic duo relate to fans. Tilt works solely on fan involvement, and The Chainsmokers are known for creating a close relationship with their fan base. They almost always join the after party, discuss fan encounters on their Sirius XM show “Nice Hair” and are known to retweet and respond to fans online. Oh, and we can’t forget their beautiful puppy, Cheddar. (Follow him on Insta @cheddarsaycheese. Seriously. You won’t regret it.) For artists like The Chainsmokers, a form of touring that cuts out the middleman is clearly superior to the old school touring model.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how the emergences of crowd funding changes the way artists do what they do. The possibilities are endless.

The company is always looking for more campus reps to make a small goal a reality.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGVMZ7OgzTU</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/chainsmokers-tackle-earl-warren-showgrounds/","id":6793,"author":{"id":122,"name":"Sohila Sandher"},"related":[6792,6791,6790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"KCSB Annual Fund Drive is Back","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fund-drive-ad.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fund-drive-ad.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"KCSB’s Annual Fund Drive is back!

beacon of excitement amongst a quiet campus. UCSB students escaped the looming threat of midterms for a few hours and rocked out to some of Isla Vista’s local bands at the Hub. The Associated Students-sponsored event gave five bands the chance to compete for a grand prize: a professionally recorded music video created by UCSB Amplified.</p>\n<p>Students migrated from the beer garden to the crowd in front of the stage as the first band, Feral Vida, took the stage. Their friendly smiles were met with shouts of “Feral Vida!” from the growing mass of people. The band kept the cheers going with an upbeat tempo and Augie Houlemard’s loud, raspy vocals that filled the room. Both guitarists demonstrated their dexterity during their cover of Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” with long guitar riffs and drawn-out high notes. Feral Vida got the crowd jumping and ready for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>With a steady beat and mellow sound, Frisson created a more relaxed atmosphere. The slow guitar picking and lower vocals in their first few songs got the crowd swaying and nodding their heads to the beat. Many students made their way back to the beer garden to tap along from the comfort of their seats. The band picked up the pace later in the set with a fast beat and head banging that brought people back to the dance floor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kaitlyn Haberlin, smiling and wide-eyed, remarked, “The first two acts were really cool. I’m surprised at the skill and ability they have as artists. They’re super awesome and fun and they get the crowd excited.”</p>\n<p>Savage Henry took the stage next, their sense of fun and humor revealed before they even began to play. They danced to the intermission music while onstage and playfully pointed their guitars at the audience. The set began with a chest-pounding beat and Wilder Kehke’s high, vibrato-filled voice. The sudden quickening of the drums and loud guitar chords incited mosh pits and crowd surfing as the two guitarists played face-to-face onstage. The lively group finished their set with a clash of smashing drums, squealing guitar and sweeping keyboard in an epic climax.</p>\n<p>Sanders Circus came off strong from the start with loud, grainy electric guitar and calls of “Are you ready?” from guitarist and vocalist David Kuperman. During their cover of “Purple Haze,” Kuperman took the spotlight, dropping to his knees dramatically as he played. His guitar riffs played from behind his head sent the crowd into a frenzy while bassist Joe Barnes gave each song a full sound with funky bass solos. John Pagliassotti, a member of Savage Henry, said of Sanders Circus, “Oh yeah, these guys can really wail.” Lights flashed rapidly as the band finished with a flourish of cymbals.</p>\n<p>From smooth, harmonious guitar to quick bursts of drums and bass, The Don’ts demonstrated their skill and versatility while the crowd chanted their name. Clear, lingering high notes and sliding guitar from both guitarists, Blake Elliot and Ben Seilhamer, created a dynamic sound. Smooth bass and mellow vocals from Mitchell Solkov quickly became a jarring blast of guitar and throaty belting as the song picked up in tempo. Multiple guitar solos and lightning-fast riffing from the two guitarists left the crowd cheering once again.</p>\n<p>The Hub erupted in applause when Savage Henry, the winning band, took the stage. Kehke, all smiles, humbly approached the microphone, calling out to the audience, “Thank you for supporting our band, and supporting all the bands here tonight!” When asked about their performance, Pagliassotti replied, “It was great. We practiced this set like 10 times in the last week, so it was so easy to play the music that you just focus on having fun.” Drummer Will Hettel remarked with a laugh, “To put things in perspective we pretty much never practice, so it was a change in pace.”</p>\n<p>The Battle of the Bands was a clear demonstration of the flourishing arts and music in I.V. Each band brought a unique aspect of performance to the stage, whether in their music or in the way they had fun onstage. With many different styles, personalities and talents, students experienced a night filled with variety all with the classic sound of rock and roll.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/","id":6795,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6794,6793,6792],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
