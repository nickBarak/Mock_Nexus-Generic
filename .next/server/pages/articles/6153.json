The irony of the information’s medium was not lost upon me or the Internet community. After the initial shock, understanding the meaning of Jobs’ life and work, which so dramatically shaped our generation’s relationship with technology, became incomprehensible. The Internet seemed the only recourse. Apple stated, “Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives.” Can his prescience, minimalism and ingenuity truly be eulogized in such a concise statement?</p>\n<p>By this point we probably have all been inundated with the narrative of Steve Jobs’ life, but it makes the details no less sensational. From his adoption to his precocious interest in computers at an early age, his Jobs’ life seemed linearly projected for greatness. He first brought us the Apple I, of such minimalist design it featured no display or keyboard, before ushering in the personal computer era with the unveiling of the Apple II in 1977. Following a 10-year forced sabbatical that started in 1985, Jobs returned to a floundering Apple Corporation in 1996 and unleashed innumerable devices that forever altered the technological landscape. Peaking with the 10-year run, starting in 2001, that birthed the iPod, iTunes, iPhone and iPad, Jobs propelled Apple to its perch atop the consumer peak it occupies today. It is impossible to overstate the material impact Jobs’ life has had on the contemporary world.</p>\n<p>Lost in the shuffle, though, are the qualities that made him so gifted or, rather, mercurial. It is our morbid fascination with death that compels us to impart value on the lives of the recently deceased. So, in passing, Steve Jobs becomes a headline, the trending topic of the day, before fading into the recesses of our brains as an icon, distant and unfamiliar. But that should be the fate of a lesser man, for Jobs left us more than products, provocative marketing campaigns and the largest publicly traded company in the world based on market capitalization.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Steve Job’s took his garage hobby and fundamentally re-envisioned the public’s relationship with capitalism. Apple products transmitted individuality, while, paradoxically, being available for mass consumption. Moreover, they connected technology with personal expression and creativity rather than the robotic efficiency that had come to signify our relationship with computers. Jobs gave us iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto among numerous other creative media that inspired many of today’s creative artists. Shit, the man gave us Pixar for crying out loud. Each movie: “Toy Story,”</p>\n<p>“Finding Nemo,” “Monsters Inc.” and onward, incrementally asked us to dream, to seek out adventure and to take solace in the fact that we are not alone, that the world can be a beautiful place.</p>\n<p>Steve Jobs’ lasting legacy should not be the products he created, the wealth he earned or the company he left us, but rather how we perceive the world around us. A world fraught with opportunity, one in which we have the unique capacity to change it for the better. No quotes or respects paid can fully convey the enormity of his footprint in the world of today. But maybe, even in life, Jobs left us a way for understanding his death. From the 2005 Stanford Commencement speech he delivered:</p>\n<p>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”</p>\n<p>Jake Schurmeier is a fourth-year political science major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

is that it avoids being crushed under the gargantuan weight of its own canon — seriously, just imagine the production costs of the last eighteen movies weighed in gold bullion. You have ten years’ worth of movie characters stuffed into two and a half hours, and somehow it managed not to suck!</p>\n<p>This movie’s storyline has been building up in bits and pieces since the 2012 Avengers film, but we’ve all gotten the gist by now: Thanos wants to collect a bunch of super-powered rocks that will give him ultimate power, and the Avengers, with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy, gotta stop him. But after two “Avengers” movies and “Civil War,” the novelty of huge crossover movies has worn itself out, and not being awful shouldn’t be one of this movie’s main points of praise.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So why does it feel like it is? I think it’s because there’s very little “Infinity War” does exceptionally well at. We’ve seen witty banter among a big cast of characters already. We’ve seen giant, sprawling battles of people fighting various CGI abominations. We’ve seen fights between fan-favorite characters. In a vague sense, we’ve seen “Infinity War” before, and it doesn’t do anything particularly special to make itself stand out against its predecessors.</p>\n<p>But it’s not bad. Nope, not at all. It’s fun and funny. It’s a good time. Stuff goes boom, characters crack jokes. Yes, it’s fun to see the Avengers interact with the Guardians of the Galaxy, which at least adds a new dynamic of crossover that we haven’t seen since the first “Avengers.”</p>\n<p>Narrative-wise, I also feel like “Infinity War” <em>is</em> a major step up from “Age of Ultron<em>.</em>” Which is sort of like saying that a bottled cabernet is a step up from bagged wine, but at least this movie at least concludes Thanos’s overall arc that Joss Whedon kicked off back in 2012 and saw fit to remind us of three years later in an otherwise mediocre movie.</p>\n<p>And while I’m on the topic of the latest motion-capture baddie, let me address him. Thanos (Josh Brolin) is another notable Marvel villain improvement, a fantastical realization of badditude right off the heels of the more grounded Killmonger. I wouldn’t say Brolin’s character has a fully fleshed-out personality, but he does at least have more than two emotions and complicated motivations. I don’t remember where, but I read somewhere once that the best villains are the one with sympathetic goals.</p>\n<p>Thanos’s objective is not at all good, but not wholly unsympathetic, either. He wants to use the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the universe to combat overpopulation. He truly believes himself to be working for the greater good, and since his methods have yielded positive results (at least, so he claims), it is impossible to dismiss his tactics completely. Although I question whether or not Thanos has considered creating more food and/or planets to better solve the problem. You have power over all space and time — there have to be more humane options you can conjure than vaporizing half of everything.</p>\n<p>Thinking about it, Thanos may just be the major point of praise that this film is deserving of. Now that he is finally taking an active role in the plot instead of sitting behind the scenes like a buff bogeyman, he gets to show off just what makes him the most-feared bad guy in the galaxy and why Loki shivers at the thought of him.</p>\n<p>One complaint I’ve seen circulating around the Internet that amuses me is the notion that this film will be impossible for those who have not seen the prior films. Well, yes. That’s sort of the point of a sequel and/or crossover. Being upset about that is like complaining that “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” did not go out of its way to explain who Harry, Ron and Hermione are and what they’re doing. If you don’t know what’s going on, watch the other movies. It’s certainly not as troublesome as loudly asking the kid sitting next to you who every character in the movie is. I’m looking at you, girl and her dad/uncle/grandpa/nondescript older male relation sitting two seats down from me at the theater.</p>\n<p>If I do have any genuine complaints, it’s the ending. The last two minutes before the credits roll just feel…weightless. But it’s not necessarily the movie’s fault; rather, it’s the fact that I can’t go anywhere on the Internet without seeing the casting info for “Avengers 4.” If I know who’s coming back for the next one, that pretty much kills any tension this movie’s trying to set up.</p>\n<p>But, y’know what? So what. That’s just a quibble. If you want to have fun for two and a half hours, this is what you want to see. I’m not particularly sentimental about the MCU — at least, not as much as that person I saw on Twitter who fainted after seeing the movie — but I know damn good popcorn entertainment when I see it. The film critic in me is disappointed that I wasn’t wowed, but the average filmgoer part enjoyed himself. “Infinity War” is a movie that shouldn’t have worked, but it did, and it’s fun.</p>\n<p>Good enough, I say. Just not great.</p>\n<p><em>We’re not sure if Wehrung has impossibly high standards or if he’s just a sourpuss.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/artsweek-reviews-avengers-infinity-war/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/artsweek-reviews-avengers-infinity-war/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/artsweek-reviews-avengers-infinity-war/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/artsweek-reviews-avengers-infinity-war/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/artsweek-reviews-avengers-infinity-war/","id":6150,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6149,6148,6147],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“No-Otter” Zone Stunts Population, Prompts Public Hearing","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Have you ever been to Monterey or Santa Cruz and seen those cute little otters hanging out near the beach?

I have and, until recently, I never thought twice about why we don’t see otters like that in Santa Barbara or L.A.</p>\n<p>It turns out that although Southern sea otters are listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, a “no-otter” zone is enforced between Point Conception and the U.S.- Mexico border. Established in 1987 through a Congressional exemption, this zone was an attempt to balance industry interests with the needs of a species. A number of otters are translocated (removed and relocated) from this zone and either brought north or put on San Nicolas Island as an experimental population.</p>\n<p>Such efforts have failed and the sea otter population is declining. We shouldn’t be limiting the natural habitat of this species by creating imaginary boundaries on its expansion. If anything, removing the “no-otter” zone would lead to population growth and eventually removal from the endangered species list. Furthermore, otters keep coastal ecosystems healthy and attract eco-tourism. They prevent sea urchin populations from booming and then destroying kelp forests, which in turn promotes biodiversity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There will be a hearing tonight from 5 to 8 p.m. at Fleischman Auditorium in the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.

Excess. We have access to everything and anything, good and bad. You and I are the small fraction of humanity alive today that gets to live in a way that no person ever has before. It’s a time of relative prosperity, and for some reason this has people mad. They are angry about the choices other people are making, which seems like an eternal theme with America. They’ve taken up arms and said, “Enough is enough; we can’t let you go live your life the way you want.” They’re getting involved and they’re bringing the government with them.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering what I’m talking about. Drugs? Wealth? Sex? Biased media? Pauly Shore movies? Nope. I’m talking about fast food. We’ve entered the era of fast food demonetization — a decade grounded in perpetuating grayed-out stock footage featuring faceless obese Americans. When we can’t be mad about hippies, rock music, drugs, sexuality or punk music, we start grasping at straws. One of these straws just so happens to be the food we eat.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but it never seems like those demonizing fast food are living at the poverty line. They’re the “well to do” Whole Foods suburbanites with too much free time. They’re a leisure class that needs something simple and concrete to pick on. So here is my plea: have some compassion. Be a bit humble — if only for a second — and realize that for most people, fast food is the ONLY option. Is that optimal? No. But does it help at all to tax these people more? To stigmatize and berate them for the choices they make for themselves and their families? Any tax on fast food is in itself a tax on the poor. It’s an abridgment to the liberties of those less fortunate so that some silly utopian ideal can be upheld. It’s absurd, irresponsible and shortsighted. It’s elitist snobbery, plain and simple. It’s a way of giving local and immediate strife to others and meaning to our cushy existence. We are fighting morally bankrupt wars and digging our way out of economic crisis, but all the food police care about is how other people are living their lives. For that they should show some shame.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Is fast food good for you? Anti-fast-food activists claim we’ve entered an age of premature death, and its cause is fast food. That makes for a good headline, but, according to the CDC’s report on life expectancy titled “Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2007,” “A baby born in 2007 has the highest life expectancy in the history of the United States.” That’s it, plain and simple; we live in a time where everything is better than it has ever been, but no one really wants to admit that. There isn’t any hard data correlating the success of fast food companies with premature fatality in anyone. It’s just not there. However, let’s say fast food is killing people. Let’s say we can find proof that fast food kills. We are adults making our own decisions about how we live. And that’s it in a nutshell. Fighting fast food is fighting freedom; they are ideals that are one in the same.</p>\n<p>So maybe fast food isn’t killing us, but it’s addictive, right? They’re out to get us with food high in salt, sugar and fat so we have no choice but to come back and eat. Well, do you know what tastes good? Salt, sugar and fat. Saying it’s a fast food company’s responsibility to keep us healthy is absurd. They make food that tastes good, so why exactly are we mad? Oh, an obesity crisis? Let’s just outline this. Fast food companies make food that we want to eat, so some of us eat too much — completely willingly — and get fat. Now we’re saying the government needs to step in and dissuade us? Does anyone else see how this is absurd? Blaming fast food for making people fat is like blaming video game companies for making me vitamin D-deficient. We all live in a place where we can partake in everything to any excess so long as it doesn’t harm anyone else; it is our right. Any restriction to what we consume is an affront to the ideals of freedom and liberty and should be treated as such.</p>\n<p>These same fast food fighters are lobbying to pass a soda tax, which would tax the purchase of sugar-based drink products. Here’s the problem with a soda tax: According to the Environmental Working Group, our government spends $3,519,507,154 subsidizing corn. That’s 3.5 billion dollars of OUR money spent to make farmers grow corn. That corn is then converted into high fructose corn syrup, which is used in our sugar drinks. Our tax money makes soda dirt cheap. Now the anti-fast-food crusaders want to tax this soda? We are getting screwed at both ends on this deal. We’re paying to make the soda, then paying extra for the “right” to consume it. This tax won’t stop people from consuming soda, it will just make it more expensive. It is a futile dieting flail from hardcore fast-food reformists. It’s social engineering, plain and simple. You can’t legislate people into wanting and not wanting something. It has never worked and it never will.</p>\n<p>On July 30, 2008, the Los Angeles City Council passed a ban on establishing new fast food restaurants in low-income areas. On that day, the City Council decided their knowledge of social welfare superseded that of the free market’s ability to promote businesses that provided desired goods and services. On July 30, citizens of L.A. lost a lot of freedom, and we should be ashamed of that. They lost their liberty for the sake of someone else’s misguided activism. Do you think those who relied on fast food to feed their families wanted this reform? This abuse of power goes to show the dangerous precipice social engineering teeters on. It is reactionary and absurd to try to legislate the personal decisions people make in order to get by.</p>\n<p>Numbers don’t matter because it’s all about this very simple question: “Should our government have any control over what we, as consenting adults, put into our bodies?” Exercise your right to eat what you want, and don’t tell other people how to take care of themselves. Anything else is garbage.</p>\n<p><em>Ian Davis is a first-year English major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/demonizing-ronald-mcdonald-misses-mark/","id":6152,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6151,6150,6149],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
