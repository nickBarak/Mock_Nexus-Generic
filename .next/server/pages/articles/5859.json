According to freshman Eric Lendrum, “The policy did not take into consideration students’ opinions. There was not even an opinion poll to see if students who pay to attend the university even want a policy like this.” Lendrum does not smoke or chew tobacco, yet his opinion is reflective of a general consensus among students that former President Yudof should have asked their opinions before making such a drastic move.</p>\n<p>Across the nation, the United States has tried to cut back smoking. In Europe, however, it is quite the contrary. Pietro Moro, a student at UCSB, lived in Italy until the age of 17. As he tells, “At my high school in Italy, students were allowed to smoke on campus as long as they were 16.” UCSB boasts about bringing students to the university through foreign exchange programs and educating students that move here from another country as Moro did, yet UC officials don’t take into consideration the needs that these students may have, coming from very different cultures.</p>\n<p>As a smoker, Moro explains, “The policy may not affect me now, but when it comes down to crunch time with midterms and finals, a smoker will always find a way to smoke. I am not sure why they didn’t find a middle ground such as putting in designated smoking areas.”</p>\n<p>Moro’s uncertainties are well-founded and justified. Why didn’t the policy implement designated smoking areas? Designated smoking areas would allow nicotine and tobacco users the freedom to use their product of choice while also reducing second-hand smoke on campus — everybody wins. But apparently allowing designated smoking areas or electronic cigarettes was not drastic enough for the UC system.</p>\n<p>During an interview with senior Ben Abrams, the question of electronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes) was addressed, “As for e-cigarettes and chewing tobacco, I think it is a ridiculous idea that we need to ban something because it is unhealthy for the user alone — by this logic they should also force out the on-campus candy and fast food sales.”</p>\n<p>E-cigarettes and chewing tobacco do not harm anyone but the person using the substance. As Abrams pointed out, this sounds an awful lot like fast food and candy. Yet we still have fast food and candy on campus because these items maximize profit to the university unlike tobacco products. Granted, the degree of harm differs between the two categories, but once the precedent of institutional restriction of self-harm is introduced, it is difficult to say when it has gone too far.</p>\n<p>A general consensus of students seems to agree: We should have a voice on matters like these. Because if the UC President has the authority to create a radical policy like this without any student consent, what policy is next to come?</p>\n<p><em>Austin Yack is a second-year political science major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

It should be an encouraging sign for the politically inclined that any U.S. politician would be a household name in a country where we monitor the statements made by “Duck Dynasty” cast members more closely than those of our congressmen. However, the New York City-native is not famous for introducing meaningful legislation or for exercising political clout. Rather, Weiner was cemented into the American mind when, as I’m sure you remember, a lewd photo of the congressman appeared briefly on his Twitter account in 2011, sparking a scandal that spanned over two years and caused a media frenzy.</p>\n<p>While his original public position was that his account had been hacked as a prank, within weeks Weiner gave a tearful confession in which he admitted to engaging in “inappropriate online relationships” with a variety of women he had met on the Internet. The media grabbed ahold of the scandal immediately, and soon discussion about Weiner’s, well, “wiener,” was taking place on every major news network. Political journalists gleefully coined the term “Weinergate”and headlines following a “Insert-Your-Weiner-Pun-Here” formula crowded newsstands, particularly in New York where raking someone over the coals is practically an art form.</p>\n<p>By the time Weiner resigned from Congress on June 16, he was the talk of the nation. His woes only continued during an attempted return to politics in the 2013 race for mayor of New York. During the campaign, more pictures and messages were released and Weiner was thrust back into the spotlight. He officially dropped out of the race in June, and once again a grown man sending suggestive photographs to women became a national news story. Amongst all the excitement that accompanies scandals of such longevity, many Americans failed to ask themselves an important question: Why should we care? The simple answer is: we should not.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We should not ignore such a scandal because Anthony Weiner deserves our sympathy or respect. Weiner is certainly a scumbag for cheating on his wife and embarrassing his family. You could make the case that he deserved to be dragged through the mud the way he was, but that does not mean we should confuse this type of frivolous gossip with actual news.</p>\n<p>While political analysts in suits discussed Anthony Weiner’s “dick pics,” an unprecedented income gap between the have’s and have-not’s continued to widen, powerful lobbies in Washington continued to control more aspects of legislature than anyone cares to admit and the NSA was collecting masses of private data on American citizens without their knowledge. The opaque world of politics is ripe with scandals that actually affect the American quality of life. By giving airtime to something as unimportant (on a national scale) as the infidelity of a public figure, we’re spending less time digging into these far more pressing issues. It is just another example of our growing preference for spending our time on what we want to hear rather than what we need to hear. The problem with this trend, this sensationalist, substance-less version of “news,” is that it trades our political discourse for tabloid fodder.</p>\n<p>To pass off the country’s fascination with this story as relevant because congressmen are supposed to be held to a high moral standard is laughable. Is “unfaithful” a description idealistically befitting of a congressman? Of course it’s not. But we as a people are either ignorant or lying to ourselves if we do not acknowledge that dishonesty and deception are traits for which politicians are naturally selected. The power struggle in Washington is a game in which politicians lie and cheat, and sometimes they’re going to get caught. Google “politician sex scandal” and look at the laundry list of familiar names. In fact, go check out what’s going on with France’s President Hollande at the moment — for the past week, his current extramarital affair has completely overshadowed his poor ratings. Is it really shocking that powerful, wealthy men who make a living on their appearance and ability to speak persuasively, stray from home? Is infidelity really where we want to draw the line for holding our politicians accountable? Is there nothing more substantive to investigate?</p>\n<p>Disguised as rightful indignation at the unfaithful actions of a congressman, the frenzy that accompanies a scandal like Weiner’s or Hollande’s is, in reality, driven by the same love for petty gossip that inspires high school drama. The whole thing, really, is inherently childish, from the tireless use of the ridiculous term “sexting,” to the way Republicans chomped at the bit to get in their digs at a partisan opponent. While the news was caught up in this adolescent natter, the secretive and often sinister world of politics hummed along, continuing to be largely ignored and misunderstood by those who couldn’t take the time to pay attention unless there were half-naked public figures involved.</p>\n<p>The only thing worth discussing about Anthony Weiner are his politics — they are the only relevant aspects of his life to the average American. If he is also an ass, that is unfortunate, but that doesn’t make it national news. If you follow politics independent of the occasional scandal, the “sexting” debacle is far from the first sign that Weiner is a total jerk. Prone to outbursts to and against the media, and often criticized as being more concerned with camera time and his mayoral aspirations than with passing meaningful legislation as a congressman, Weiner and his unfaithfulness seems almost a foregone conclusion. Yet we react with outraged indignation all around the country at the realization that an outwardly selfish and rude person did a selfish, rude thing.</p>\n<p>It would be excellent to live in a magical world where infidelity was the most egregious crime committed by a politician. Unfortunately, this is the least of our worries. As long as corruption and inequality plague the inner workings of our governing bodies, it would do us Americans well to be unsatisfied with a scandal of such little significance. Every time we allow ourselves to hear stories like the Weiner scandal and consider ourselves to be “following politics,” we play into the hand of individuals who benefit from our interest in the petty and personal, and from our ignorance of the greater injustices at play. The next time a story of this nature arises, we would be wise to put small distractions like Weiner’s wiener to the side and focus on much larger issues.</p>\n<p><em>Matthew Meyer is a second-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

The change in actors over time is very intricate and a proof of the right casting choices. The discussion of race and sexuality is handled perfectly, as director Barry Jenkins never uses it for a preachy, social justice statement that disrupts the flow of the narrative. Instead, it blends in the background and is used as a storytelling device in showing the realistic nature of Chrion’s internal dilemma. As each chapter ends and another begins, one can feel the effects of the previous chapter seeping into the next one. Every scene builds from the next, as they are placed together to bring about conflict. Amid all the torment and loneliness surrounding him, he is still able to find his own niche by the end and reconcile with those who wronged him. Jenkins does not accomplish this through conventional means such as expositional dialogue. Instead, a simple movement of the camera or timing of the scene communicates the moment and the emotion surrounding it without a single word. While every single shot doesn’t achieve this, the ones that do are such distinct shots that they resonate with the viewer long after leaving the theater.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film is ultimately a character piece, as the most important part of telling Chiron’s story is all the people who are integral to his journey. Mahershala Ali gives the most vibrant performance as Juan, a drug dealer who sees pity in Chiron and wants to help him. His development is the most noticeable, as he is the first person in the narrative to act kind to Chiron despite what his job might suggest about him. The peak of his story arc puts him in a somber state because of his relation to Chiron’s mother Paula. While actress Naomie Harris’ performance boasts a colorful personality, Jenkins contrasts this later in the story with a mother regretful of her actions in the past and asking for forgiveness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last main component in telling this story is the music. Nicholas Britell’s score is very slow, centered around either piano or violin, which allows each instrument to communicate a different feeling to the audience. While the camerawork and the characters told this story in visual and story-driven way respectively, the music adds an emotional layer to the story. With the exception of moments that use music for its own meaning, the score goes from scattered and detached violin scratches with a melancholy feeling, to the calm piano that emits a somber mood to the flow of a violin bringing about moments of gracefulness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘Moonlight’ is the kind of film that stays present in your mind long after it is over. Even though the film is adapted from the play “In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,” its themes translate to film effortlessly. Though I wasn’t necessarily moved away completely by such a powerful film, I could still respect Jenkins for the way in which this story was told and the themes that were incorporated. And in light of Election Day, this film can stand as a glimmering light for anyone in need. For African Americans and the LGBT community, it is a personal and poignant representation of a queer African American male, a character not commonly portrayed in film, struggling with the harsh world surrounding him. For everyone else, it is a heartfelt story about growing into a complete person with the help of those who come into your life along the way.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74327\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74327\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/","id":5857,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5856,5855,5854],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Beasts’ is Not So Fantastic","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1","description":"'Beasts' is brave enough to detach just enough from its enormously successful predecessor, however, the film relies too much on its pre-established and well-realized setting and lore.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a short break, the Harry Potter franchise returns with a conflicted prequel that has difficulty finding its own voice. Unlike other prequel series, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is brave enough to detach just enough from its enormously successful predecessor, introducing characters unlike that which we’ve seen before and tones that are at times hilarious and genuinely troubling. However, the film relies too much on its pre-established and well-realized setting and lore, losing its grip on executing anything original, fumbling around with its clashing tones and plots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fantastic Beasts” follows magical zoologist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, as he journeys to New York in the 1920s. Upon arrival, Newt immediately loses and unleashes his misunderstood creatures and heads out to find them with unlikely and newly found friends. All the while, a conflict between wizards and the No-Maj (American’s version of the Muggle, those who don’t practice magic) seems to be brewing, as a dark unknown force begins to terrorize Manhattan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of working together, the duel plots of “Fantastic Beasts” are constantly at odds. The first plot, which follows Newt and his friends, is at times charming and hilarious, focusing on the revealing of magical beasts or fantastic locales. Sadly, it never develops its characters and chooses to rely on the setting as a crux for its content. And while the concept of tracking down monsters is a rather fresh and intriguing one, it’s rarely utilized and mostly, disappointingly, absent from the film.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other plot, being far darker, verges on the macabre, and takes itself rather seriously, although it is never given enough time to be anything more than a tease for the eventual climactic reveal. However, some things accomplished during this tone are incredible and disturbing, a welcome risk into darker and controversial territory. The potential conflicts raised here are more compelling than what was seen at Hogwarts, but fortunately for the original series, and unfortunately for the audience, these conflicts are never really explored and are laughably resolved. In the same intensified way, it would have been nice to see the light-hearted moments push farther into the ridiculous and the comedic. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74511\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"68081505\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74494\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74511\" data-attachment-id=\"74511\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/movies-111816-square640/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"movies-111816-square640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74511 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=640%2C640\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/movies-111816-square640.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Fantastic Beasts” follows magical zoologist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne (left), as he journeys to New York in the 1920s.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two tones work well on their own, but there is not much effort given to bring the two together, resulting in two separate films that are thin in content. In addition, any time spent with each plot is plagued by strange and counterproductive pacing. The film spends too much of its time in unimportant places and rushes right out of where it should be staying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best aspect of the film by far is its production design. From the adorable and inventive creatures, to the stunning magical sets, “Fantastic Beasts” establishes its world flawlessly, engrossing the audience for its entire running time. No doubt benefited by the world already established by the Potter franchise, “Fantastic Beasts” still manages to feel both refreshing and nostalgic. It’s pure bliss. This magical side of New York is just as much as an enjoyable spectacle as Hogwarts was, and with the added 1920s time period there’s a sense of style and maturity that demands to be taken in. The film is fun and makes you feel like you’re a part of the world around you. But while the setting and peacoat costumes may look incredible, the characters that tenant these designs are rather bland and shortchanged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand out performances by Dan Fogler and Colin Farrell do their best to provide the film with enjoyable characters. Fogler, who plays Jacob Kowalski, a hopeful No-Maj baker with his heart on his sleeve, is genuine and hilarious, eliciting a contrasting humor to the forced absurdity of his situation. Farrell, who plays Graves, director of magical security, provides an elusive, dark character that is mysterious in motivation thanks to his complex and seemingly honest presentation. These two easily steal every scene they’re in. The other characters, however, are not so great.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Waterston’s Tina is not only incredibly awkward, but awkwardly performed. Her gawky nature is rarely charming and her character never really clicks. In the same guise, Redmayne’s Newt is also awkward, but manages to provide a quiet and reserved charm. Even so, his quirks are too subtle and are rarely used to make him an interesting character. His lopsided grin and aversion to eye contact begin to mold him into a unique character, but his development stops there. Even with a 133-minute running time, none of these characters are given enough to be fleshed out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A creative, yet thin product, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is torn between far too many things to become anything outstanding in and of itself. It’s visually engaging, but incredibly hollow and directionless. It’s remarkably fun and comical, but by no means memorable. Without the Harry Potter backing, “Fantastic Beasts” could have become another failed attempt at creating a new fantasy franchise. There’s more good than bad to find here, but it’s definitely a personal weighing of pros and cons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters are undeveloped and the plot is barren, yet the ride is exciting, and at times quite a blast. The lack of content can even be overlooked for the film’s spectacular immersion. It’s a mindless blockbuster, but it has just enough quirk and creativity to keep it afloat and overcome most of its problems. Nonetheless, it’s not really about finding fantastic beasts or about anything else for that matter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s far from fantastic, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is by no means “The Phantom Menace,” and if you’re looking for a hollow yet visually stunning, well-produced and fun blockbuster, it is a must.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/beasts-is-not-very-fantastic/","id":5858,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5857,5856,5855],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
