Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet and KCSB News Director Monica Lopez will co-edit an anthology with a working title of <em>I.V. Strong Collaboration: Looking Beyond</em> <em>May 23rd, 2014</em>.</p>\n<p>The anthology may be in the form of an e-book or a hardcopy, and the coeditors are in the process of finding a publisher. Submissions can be in the form of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, articles, essays, visual art, photography, videography, monologues, images or screenshots of text conversations. Submissions can be anonymous or include a credit or title and must be submitted with a completed signed contribution release form to be reviewed for publication in the anthology.</p>\n<p>Scarlet said the anthology would cover the positive reactions by the Isla Vista community that occurred in the wake of the killings.</p>\n<p>“There were so many amazing things that happened in such a tragic moment, like the paddle-out and the chalk on the sidewalks, and we didn’t let [the tragedy] keep us down,” Scarlet said. “We love how beautiful that was in how we all came together and we wanted to show the world how we reacted.”</p>\n<p>According to Scarlet, the anthology will give a platform for the uplifting memories and actions not conveyed through mainstream media coverage of May 23.</p>\n<p>“You know watching the media and news, none of that was portrayed,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>Marquez said she wants the anthology to provide support to others who are still coping with the tragedy.</p>\n<p>“As a researcher, I tried to find some guidance from other folks, and there really wasn’t anything like this,” Márquez said. “In a way I want to offer it for anyone in the future, whoever finds themselves in this type of situation.”</p>\n<p>According to Lopez, the anthology would function as a collaborative creation to memorialize the victims and serve as an avenue for “people choose to heal and grieve through a creative process.”</p>\n<p>“There have been lots of photos created, there was the memorial wall created by A.S. and all of those smaller collective expressions that were really beautiful and powerful and healing for a lot of people,” Lopez said. “I think the thinking is to have a place to put it all together and share it with everybody and sort have a place to go to.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said she is primarily expecting local participation for the anthology but is open to outside submissions.</p>\n<p>“I think because we are focusing on our local networks in the Santa Barbara and Isla Vista area, that is who we are hoping will contribute,” Lopez said. “They have most of the source materials, photos, spoken word pieces, poetry and what they have already created or what they will create to express themselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Márquez, the anthology is for people who want to creatively express themselves or who already have a piece they would like to share.</p>\n<p>“This is a callout to some people who want to write something down, to the other people who will already have something that they want to share,” Márquez said.</p>\n<p>Márquez said she hopes that when people see the anthology it will engender a positive emotional reaction by demonstrating the diversity of the community’s healing process.</p>\n<p>“When someone just randomly picks [the anthology] up, I think it will give anyone who reads it the feeling of hope, the feeling that there are all these multi-faceted ways, that everyone feels differently doing different things and creating community in different ways,” Márquez said.</p>\n<p><em>According to the </em>I.V. Strong Collaboration Project <em>contribution release form, all submissions and any accompanying files for the anthology will have a submission deadline of Jan.15, 2015 at 5 p.m. and should be submitted via a contribution release form <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/dailynexus.com/forms/d/1LHlTlXvLXm8blImPkHHXSwHK_GG6KyzSj7QOIfnjx9U/viewform\">here</a> or sent to </em><a href=\"mailto:IVStrongCollab@gmail.com\">IVStrongCollab@gmail.com</a><em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58110\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/i-v-anthology-now-accepting-works/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58110\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/i-v-anthology-now-accepting-works/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/i-v-anthology-now-accepting-works/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/i-v-anthology-now-accepting-works/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/i-v-anthology-now-accepting-works/","id":4812,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[4811,4810,4809],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu","biography":"Not available","articles":[2306,2519,2538,2547,2568,2923,2959,4812],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Isla Vista Questions Television Episode","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  NBC TV Network aired an episode of crime series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” last Wednesday featuring alleged similarities to the Isla Vista tragedy that occurred last May.

The episode has sparked discussion among students, staff and Isla Vista residents about the alleged connection between the episode and what occurred in last May.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students President Ali Guthy, the episode’s similarity to the May 23 tragedy calls for community solidarity.</p>\n<p>“The most recent ‘Law &amp; Order SVU’ episode portrays a disturbing connection to the horrific events that darkened our UCSB community this past May 23rd,” Guthy said. “In times such as these, I would like to remind everyone to support one another, take care of one another and utilize the important services offered to the entire campus community.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said moving past the tragedy is something the community must do together.</p>\n<p>“This tragedy is not something we will move forward from easily,” Guthy said. “It will take time, patience and the love of one another and our community to become stronger and heal together.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major Nathan Silverglate said that because the episode was not in documentary form, it was not appropriate to air.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a little bit inappropriate for them to be making an episode on television about a large tragedy that’s not a documentary,” Silvergate said.</p>\n<p>However, Silverglate said he supports the First Amendment rights of the producers of “Law &amp; Order” as well as their right to make controversial material.</p>\n<p>“We do have freedom of speech in this country, so if that’s what they want to do, they can do it,” Silverglate said.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies major Jordan Fabula said he supports the producers’ apparent inspiration from what happened in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a very smart idea. With his background and his actions, I think Elliot Rodger would make a great TV or movie villain,” Fabula said. “It’s just a TV show, people should not get offended just because they’re playing off of events that happened in real life.”</p>\n<p>Third-year actuarial science major Jonah Rockowitz said the actor was so similar to Elliot Rodger that he could not watch it past the two-minute mark.</p>\n<p>“I tried watching the episode and about two minutes in I was too creeped out because the actor did a good job portraying Elliot Rodger and I could not watch the rest of the episode,” Rockowitz said.</p>\n<p>According to Rockowitz, the episode’s evident similarity to the I.V. tragedy made it difficult to watch.</p>\n<p>“I think it was uncomfortable for me because I’m so close to the incident, whereas I watch other things that are close to other incidents that I’m not close to,” Rockowitz said. “I am okay that they made it because that is what TV shows do; however it was uncomfortable for me to watch.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The piece is meant to reflect the community as a whole in the wake of the recent calamity. <em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College media and design student Ana Corrigan completed her most recent mural inside Coffee Collaborative on Pardall Road last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The mural depicts a girl with her hair transforming into a wave that sits on a sunset, as well as a skunk with a mug of coffee and a raccoon smoking a cigarette and reading a book. A tree painted to the left of the photo has six leaves, each dedicated to one of the students who lost their lives last May.</p>\n<p>Coffee Collaborative owner Steve McDonough said the idea of redoing the mural has been in the works for about a year, but it was not until recently that he decided to replace the old mural with something that better reflected the community.</p>\n<p>“Ana asked me … ‘Is it okay if I make a mural?’ and I thought we should probably redo it anyways,” McDonough said. “I was really hesitant, but it came out so much better than I suspected.”</p>\n<p>According to McDonough, the mural’s dedication to the six victims makes the painting personal for him and other Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>“We got a bullet through our window,” McDonough said, “and those leaves, each one is one of the victims.”</p>\n<p>Corrigan said she envisioned the mural from the start as a tribute to the victims of the shooting.</p>\n<p>“At first I wanted to do turtles … but putting the initials in the tree leaves was about midway in the process,” Corrigan said, “but I wanted to do the tribute from the very beginning.”</p>\n<p>Corrigan also said it was important that the piece incorporate an aspect of last May’s tragedy in order to commemorate the students who passed away.<br>\n“People are going to never forget,” Corrigan said. “When people pass away, you get this explosion of sympathy, and I wanted something always there for them to be remembered.”</p>\n<p>According to Corrigan, she chose to contribute her artwork to the Coffee Collaborative because it spotlights both student art and local musical talent.</p>\n<p>“I just feel like everyone has their own contribution to this place because there’s so many local art places, and you know people come here and play their music, they have their open mic nights,” Corrigan said. “It’s the only place in Isla Vista where students can, like, contribute … whether they’re doing homework or hanging out.”</p>\n<p>Corrigan said she has displayed many of her much smaller pieces before, but the mural is her largest to date.</p>\n<p>“Size-wise this is the biggest painting I have ever done,” Corrigan said, “but I have been selling my paintings for about a year now, a lot smaller than that.”</p>\n<p>Although the girl’s hair transforming into the wave was Corrigan’s idea, she said McDonough prompted her to put the skunk and raccoon in the mural. According to Corrigan, it took about a week to complete the mural, and while she was not paid to do the work, McDonough paid for the paints she used.</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 3 of Thursday,

a local government official questioned if the project is feasible. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The sexual assault “report card” is one of 12 demands that UC Santa Barbara administrators agreed to address in May 2017 after a student sit-in. But so far, neither the university nor the local government has started to work on it.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for the university to “work with the Isla Vista Community Services District to develop a report card… for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>At a Feb. 8 town hall, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn featured the report card in a slideshow documenting the progress made on the demands. In the slideshow, the report card was listed as “in progress.”</p>\n<p>But the university did not contact I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand about the report card until Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“The CSD looks forward to working with the university on these continued efforts, but at this point there has not been a partnership on that front,” Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> after a Feb. 12 CSD meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said she was under the impression that the CSD was working directly with students on the report card.</p>\n<p>“It had come up at one of the meetings that we had, where I was told that students were working directly with the CSD on that item,” Klawunn said. “I thought I was only reporting progress that was being made.” She said she did not remember who had told her or at which meeting.</p>\n<p>Klawunn spoke to Bertrand about the report card on Tuesday night, after the <em>Nexus </em>had inquired about the university’s progress. She said Bertrand told her that the report card is not actually feasible.</p>\n<p>“I sought Ethan out yesterday and asked him,” she said. “He said, ‘No, we can’t do it the way [Ro’Shawndra Earvin] had hoped it’d be carried out.’” Earvin led the 2017 sit-in.</p>\n<p>The demand calls for documenting crime in I.V. and counting the number of meetings that have educated the community about sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Local officials will need to find a different way to create a report card, Klawunn said. She suggested creating local crime reports as an alternative. Bertrand could not be reached to elaborate on how an alternate report card would look.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 22 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/sexual-assault-report-card-stuck-in-limbo/","id":4811,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4810,4809,4808],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
