She also shoots 37.1 percent from the field, sixth in conference.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have some different looks on her,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think Mason did an extremely good job last time we played them and we’re also going to look at Sweets Underwood at times, so we’re going to try to give her different bodies at different points in the game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will then need to then box out sophomore forward Mya Olivier, who is fourth in rebounds (7.8) and second in field goal percentage (50.4 percent).</p>\n<p>The last time the teams played on Jan. 7, Richardson tallied 14 points on 6-11 shooting. Olivier also scored in double figures with 10 and grabbed eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I just [want to do] what I did last time [on Richardson],” junior guard Destini Mason said. “She comes off a lot of screens, so I’ll be focusing on that more, but we just want to play our game defensively and hopefully it affects her.”</p>\n<p>As a team, the Titans love to crash the offensive glass and they rank first in the Big West with 15.8 per game. “Usually we run down the clock, so we have to get in rebounding position and be ready for the shot to go up,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>The last matchup was a close game, ending 39-37. Senior guard Emilie Johnson led the Gauchos with 11 points and five assists, shooting 3-4 from downtown.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struggled scoring, which is typical, but found success from behind the arc, shooting 45.5 percent from three-point land.</p>\n<p>“If the three point shot is open and its a good shot, there are certain players on our team where that’s their strength,” Mitchell said. “If it’s in the pattern or it’s a good shot, of course the player should take the shot.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44513\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-losing-streak-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44513\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-losing-streak-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-losing-streak-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-losing-streak-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-losing-streak-csuf/","id":778,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[777,776,775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Cal Poly Defeats UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s a saying that goes “if something’s not working, change it.” But even that didn’t work for the UCSB women’s basketball team, which lost 67-52 Saturday afternoon to Cal Poly.

It’s their responsibility to make sure we’re sharp.”</p>\n<p>Initially, it looked like it might work. UCSB took a 4-0 lead, but it would be the last lead they would see. A pair of unanswered 7-0 runs by Cal Poly left the Gauchos in a familiar hole and they trailed 30-15 at the break.</p>\n<p>A big issue for the Gauchos during the first half was the three-point shooting of Cal Poly, who shot 50 percent from downtown in the first period.</p>\n<p>“We were getting beat off dribble penetration, so at the end of the day, the one-on-one defense wasn’t there,” Mitchell said. “So every time you have to help, then they would kick it to a shooter.”</p>\n<p>At halftime, red-shirt senior Kristina Santiago had just four points, although she was in foul trouble early. However, she exploded in the second half, finishing with 16 and leading all scorers.</p>\n<p>“She’s a really smart player, she’s strong and she has a good shot,” freshman forward Jackie Luna-Castro said, who took on the brunt of guarding Santiago. “At times it was hard because if you get bad positioning, it’s hard for her not to score.”</p>\n<p>UCSB upped their game in the second half and played the Mustangs even on the scoreboard. They even outshot the Mustangs, but never got the score within single digits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tried to extend the game by fouling, but Cal Poly hit their free throws down the stretch. Sophomore guard Jonae Ervin was 9-10 from the line in the final two minutes.</p>\n<p>“You look at the stats here and at the end of the day, the free throw line tells the story of the game,” Mitchell said. “They made 18 free throws and we made four.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers aren’t usually an issue for UCSB, which gave the ball away 15 times. However, the Mustangs took advantage of their opportunities, outscoring the Gauchos 13-4 off turnovers.</p>\n<p>“I will never get used to losing, and these guys will never get used to losing,” Mitchell said. “And that’s what I tell them, ‘Continue to remember how badly this feels and when it doesn’t hurt anymore, then we’re in trouble.’”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Emilie Johnson and sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit led UC Santa Barbara with 12 points apiece, although 22 of those 24 points came in the second half.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues play at home Thursday against Cal State Fullerton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cal-poly-defeats-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cal-poly-defeats-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cal-poly-defeats-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cal-poly-defeats-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cal-poly-defeats-ucsb/","id":775,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[774,773,772],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Blue-Collar Baller","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Kirsten Tilleman is a lot of things to the UCSB women’s basketball team, but in a word, she is selfless.

She’s going to try to grab every single rebound. It’s all the little things that can help us win a game.”</p>\n<p>During the course of a game, the Bozeman, Montana native spends a good amount of time on the ground, diving for loose balls or standing up after taking one of her many charges.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s natural,” Tilleman said. “[I’m] going to do anything [I] can to contribute to the team and to the game and that means diving for the ball. It means giving everything you have.”</p>\n<p>Tilleman’s propensity to embrace the physicality is especially important on a team that is often undersized. Tilleman, at 6’1”, usually faces a height disadvantage herself, guarding the other team’s tallest and most physical player.</p>\n<p>“I enjoy it,” Tilleman said. “I think I might not be the most athletic or the strongest person on the court, but I try to use my body well.”</p>\n<p>The idea that rebounding and defense are not entirely based on size and strength is apparent in Tilleman’s game, and echoed by her head coach.</p>\n<p>“Some of it is will, but she also knows how to use her body,” Mitchell said. “A lot of times, people don’t understand positioning or angles and it’s obvious she understands. That’s why she can guard 6’4’’ [players] and tip a lot of the balls away.”</p>\n<p>As a result, Tilleman is second best on the team in steals, averaging 1.1 a game.</p>\n<p>“Naturally for me on the court, I want to play defense,” Tilleman said. “I take a lot of pride in not letting a player I’m guarding score, but also in helping out my teammates.”</p>\n<p>But what really sets Tilleman apart is her rebounding. She leads her team and ranks third in the Big West in rebounding overall at 8.1 per game.</p>\n<p>“I always think rebounding is one of the most important aspects of the game because it gets you possessions and it keeps possessions from the other team,” Tilleman said. “It’s really demoralizing when you play defense for 30 seconds and you get a great stop, but you don’t secure the rebound because none of that matters. They get another shot at the basket.”</p>\n<p>In conference, she is number two in offensive rebounds (3.2) and sixth in defensive rebounds (4.6).</p>\n<p>“I think it comes down to anticipating where the ball is going, but also blocking out,” Tilleman said. “You learn it from day one when you begin basketball … but I’m not 6’4’’, so [I] have to do those little things … and maybe bang around a few people.”</p>\n<p>The numbers are consistent, too. She maintains her defensive intensity and hits the glass night in and night out.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, you know you’re going to get your six to eight points and 10 or 12 rebounds,” Mitchell said. “As a coach, that makes you feel real confident and probably as a teammate you’d feel good about knowing that, taking that shot, she’ll be there for the rebound.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell has awarded Tilleman for her strong play. She plays 30.1 minutes per contest, the second most on the team.</p>\n<p>“I think she’s always been used to being backed up against the wall or maybe been told that because of her size, she couldn’t do this or do that,” Mitchell said. “So I think she’s always had that edge about her, trying to always prove herself and that’s how she plays.”</p>\n<p>One of the things that struck me most about Tilleman though, was her passion. She loves the game, and it shines through on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I always see [basketball] as a chance for me to go out there and let everything else going on in my life just go and have fun and enjoy that connection I have with my teammates,” Tilleman said. “I like working hard and I like the satisfaction at the end of the game knowing that [I] gave everything.”</p>\n<p>When asked about her goals moving forward, Tilleman didn’t focus on anything too individualistic, but talked about what she could do for the program.</p>\n<p>“I want to be able to help bring this team together, to lift us up,” Tilleman said. “It’s not been the ideal season, but we still have a lot of it left and what it really boils down to is that we’re all still fighting for — that tournament at the end of the year. That’s what matters.”</p>\n<p>There’s certainly nothing selfish about that.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44422\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44422\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/","id":776,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[775,774,773],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Welcome Matadors to Thunderdome","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s basketball will attempt to start a winning streak tonight against Cal State Fullerton, the team in the basement of the Big West standings.

She also shoots 37.1 percent from the field, sixth in conference.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have some different looks on her,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think Mason did an extremely good job last time we played them and we’re also going to look at Sweets Underwood at times, so we’re going to try to give her different bodies at different points in the game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will then need to box out sophomore forward Mya Olivier, who is fourth in rebounds (7.8) and second in field goal percentage (50.4 percent).</p>\n<p>Last time, when the teams played on Jan. 7, Richardson tallied 14 points on 6-11 shooting. Oliver also scored in double figures with 10 and grabbed eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I just [want to do] what I did last time [on Richardson],” junior guard Destini Mason said. “She comes off a lot of screens, so I’ll be focusing on that more, but we just want to play our game defensively and hopefully it affects her.”</p>\n<p>As a team, the Titans love to crash the offensive glass and they rank first in the Big West with 15.8 per game.</p>\n<p>“Usually we run down the clock, so we have to get in rebounding position and be ready for the shot to go up,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>In the last matchup, it was a close game, ending 39-37. Senior guard Emilie Johnson led the Gauchos with 11 points and five assists, shooting 3-4 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a hard fought game,” Johnson said. “It was a low scoring game last time, so it’s going to be a battle to the end. I know we’re battle tested in close games. We’re ready.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struggled scoring, which is typical, but found success from behind the arc, shooting 45.5 percent from three.</p>\n<p>“If the three point shot is open and it’s a good shot, there are certain players on our team where that’s their strength,” Mitchell said. “If it’s in the pattern or it’s a good shot, of course the player should take the shot.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44473\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-09/gauchos-matadors-thunderdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44473\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-09/gauchos-matadors-thunderdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-09/gauchos-matadors-thunderdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-09/gauchos-matadors-thunderdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-09/gauchos-matadors-thunderdome/","id":777,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[776,775,774],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
