The deputies watched in a daze, wondering if they had been teleported back to a ’60s anti-realism brigade, as three cars did their best to maneuver around the individual. Suddenly, the wild man dropped his trousers, flashing the drivers as he laughed and continued yelling. The officers approached and tried not to look at his flaccid free willy swinging about. The cops struggled to sit the manic man down, catching him as he nearly face-planted in the middle of the street. Once seated, the individual explained that hewas merely a film studies major searching  for inspiration for a new movie.<br>\nThis  guy  clearly  had  not  checked  his  calendar to remind himself that today was  “no  one  gives  a  shit  about  your  ridiculous  ideas” day.<br>\nThe man continued to say he was from  out  of  town  and  not  familiar  with  I.V.,  as  if  that  was  a  legitimate  excuse  to  drop  his  pants in the middle of a busy intersection.  Eventually,  he  confessed  to  drinking  and  was  taken  to  Santa  Barbara  County  Jail  where  he  was  housed,  pending  sobriety.    </p>\n<p><strong>If guys like this get into college, I give up… </strong><br>\nFeb.  11,  11:27  p.m.  —  Isla  Vista’s  finest  noticed  a  lonely  straggler  stumbling  along  Del Playa Drive. They looked on in horror  as he tripped, barely avoiding a parked car  and the curb right next to it.<br>\nThe  officers  approached  the  man,  sat  him down on the curb, asked for his license  and  patiently  waited  as  the  guy  fumbled  with his wallet and dropped everything in  his  pocket.  The  out-of-towner  kept  saying  his  address  was  “Costa  Mesa”  and  that  he  went to “OCC” community college, which  told  the  officers  this  guy  clearly  did  not  know Isla Vista.<br>\nOfficers  then  asked  the  community  college champion to recite the alphabet. He  made  it  to  letter  “D”  before  proclaiming,  “Oh, this is hard.”     He  was  arrested  for  public  intoxication  and  taken  to  Santa  Barbara  County  Jail  where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33655\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-18/police-blotter-67/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33655\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-18/police-blotter-67/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-18/police-blotter-67/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-18/police-blotter-67/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-18/police-blotter-67/","id":3814,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3813,3812,3811],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros","biography":"Not available","articles":[3523,3683,3811,3812,3814,3815,3832],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, November 12, 12 a.m. — After a long night of drinking, two men attempted to drag their very, very inebriated brosef home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, Who’s the Drunkest of Them All?</strong></p>\n<p>Friday, November 12, 12 a.m. — After a long night of drinking, two men attempted to drag their very, very inebriated brosef home.</p>\n<p>When deputies contacted the staggering man, he did what every drunken person should never do in the presence of an authority figure — unzip his pants.
