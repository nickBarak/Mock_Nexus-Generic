Additionally, Collegiate Senator Adrian Orozco announced his resignation, citing career-related commitments.</p>\n<p>In contrast to last week’s heavily attended and contentious meeting, Wednesday’s meeting saw a much smaller turnout and a significantly shorter list of speakers at Public Forum. Several Senators were absent, and opted to send proxies instead.</p>\n<p>The first speakers in public forum — Mark Hartell and Rebecca Metzger of the UCSB Library staff — informed the Senate on the status of upcoming renovations to Davidson Library that are currently scheduled to last two and a half years. Hartell said the changes have been delayed for too long, and are just barely coming to life after decades of planning.</p>\n<p>“In terms of construction, nothing has happened in 35 years … It’s been many, many years in the planning, but it really is going to start,” Hartell said. “In a nutshell, the project is scheduled to run for two and a half years.”</p>\n<p>Swipes For The Homeless representatives Ali Guthy and Shannon Mirshokri also spoke during Public Forum, requesting the Senate’s support in expanding their program. Swipes For The Homeless is a program in which students can donate their unused dining commons meals to a local homeless shelter.</p>\n<p>“This is a really amazing program, and we really hope that you all will support our endeavor,” Guthy said. “This has to occur in a dialogue with administration, which currently we’re having trouble starting … we just really need more support.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja shared her thoughts on the Senate’s decision to refrain from passing last week’s divestment resolution. Ahuja said the Senate did not adequately listen to her and other individuals’ arguments in support of the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I am disgusted by this space because not only did you let bureaucratic and political crap get in the way of passing this resolution, but you also didn’t take into account the fact that over 30 organizations on this campus sponsored this resolution,” Ahuja said. “I think you need to take a look at yourself as Senate and look at the people around you … people should be aware of the privileges they do have.”</p>\n<p>Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez presented a seminar regarding a potential project aimed at teaching students important financial life skills. Additionally, Katlen Abu Ata asked senators to be aware of the unjust American prison system especially in light of a recent gang injunction proposed by the Santa Barbara County Chief of Police.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of Public Forum, Collegiate Senator Adrian Orozco officially announced his resignation from the post, in the most recent of a string of Senate resignations this year. Orozco said the decision came after considering his priorities in the near future.</p>\n<p>“I have a lot of things to worry about coming up in the next couple of weeks,” Orozco said. “It has to do with career.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Senators passed a bill changing the recruitment period of Associated Students as well as resolutions supporting Swipes for the Homeless and Martinez’s finance seminar.</p>\n<p>Senators tabled a resolution entitled “Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit form the Prison Industrial Complex” for one week, at the request of resolution author Navkiran Kaur, who was not present at the meeting. They also created ad hoc committees to deal with certain issues facing the Isla Vista community, namely the sobering center and unsafe balconies.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator Kyley Scarlet proposed an ad hoc committee to look into possible solutions for the balcony problem in order to prevent future incidents similar to the balcony that fell Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“For those of you who don’t know, 6643 [Del Playa] — their balcony collapsed,” Scarlet said. “When things like this happen, the liability falls completely on the people who live there … [The ad hoc will be] kind of figuring out what we can do about that.”</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s meeting adjourned at 12:58 a.m. Next week, A.S. Senators will address the prison divestment resolution in addition to other issues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1144913256\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50959\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50960\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-s-senates-meeting-discusses-library-renovations-nonprofits-divestment-resolution/for-04-18-2013_senate_file-photo-4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366225829\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"120\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"for 04.18.2013_senate_FILE PHOTO-4-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50960\" alt=\"for 04.18.2013_senate_FILE PHOTO-4-2\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2-250x133.jpg?resize=250%2C133\" width=\"250\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>DAILY NEXUS FILE PHOTO</h6>\n<h6>Senators at the A.S.Senate meeting last Wednesday considered the status of the Davidson Library renovation project, among other topics.

The meeting was organized by administrators in the Division of Student Affairs and Associated Students officials, and 35 students — including representatives such as the Interfraternity Council President and A.S. president — will participate. The meeting will be closed off to other students.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students marched from the Student Resource Building to the Faculty Lounge, demanding a public forum with the newly appointed UC president, who was the Secretary of Homeland Security before becoming the new leader of the UC system.</p>\n<p>Napolitano’s appointment, which came in July, has largely received backlash from many students since she is the first UC president to lack a background in education, previously acting as the governor as well as attorney general of Arizona. She has also drawn much criticism from the undocumented immigrant student community since she spearheaded the controversial Secure Communities program during her time as Secretary of Homeland Security. The deportation program seeks out undocumented immigrants using fingerprints by provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the site for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and deported around two million undocumented immigrants — including non-criminal persons — during Napolitano’s term.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s protest, student held up a giant banner highlighting the “No” in “Napolitano,” students from UCSB’s I.D.E.A.S. — or Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success — as well as other campus organizations, marched past UC Police Department officers and CSOs until finally arriving to the Faculty Lounge, where they were met by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead. After criticizing Napolitano on her implementation of record-breaking deportation programs as former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, students asked Yang and Armistead if there could be a public forum allowing more students to speak than the few “student leaders” selected by administrators.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. member and second-year student Abigail Salazar said many undocumented students on campus have been directly affected by Napolitano’s deportation programs, herself included.</p>\n<p>“With all due respect, this is a person who has invaded my home, who has destroyed my family and I wasn’t even invited [to the meeting],” Salazar said. “I want to direct a lot of feelings that I have towards her. I have that right.”</p>\n<p>Salazar also said administration’s decision to hold a private meeting instead of a public forum with Napolitano further insulted the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“I command you, Chancellor Yang, to hold a public forum,” Salazar said. “We’re not going anywhere … we will not stand by this any longer. Do you understand us? With all respect, do you understand us?”</p>\n<p>In response to student demands, Armistead said Napolitano would leave right after tomorrow morning’s private meeting and that there was thus “not enough time for a public forum.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure that everybody who was picked is happy to have an open forum,” Armistead said. “They actually want to have a dialogue, and the concern is — that this happens within the public forum, then nothing can happen and you can’t have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Attendees of tomorrow’s meeting include A.S. executive officials, leaders of campus organizations such as Human Rights Board, I.D.E.A.S. and S.C.O.R.E., or Student Commission on Racial Equality, as well as members of Greek life. However, some of the students invited are not currently the head of any campus group, according to Mario Vasquez, a member of Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Chicano Studies professor Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who joined students in protesting today, said he has taught many students who have dealt with deportation on a personal level. He said student demonstrations should push Napolitano to support the undocumented student community and advocate for immigration policy reform.</p>\n<p>“She could apologize for what she did, and she could put pressure on the Obama administration to stop what it’s doing,” Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said. “It’s nearly deported two million people, which is more people combined than any other in U.S. history.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano has also expressed support for the DREAM Act and undocumented students, and she recently devoted $5 million in UC funding to financial aid and special counseling for undocumented UC students, according to a UC Office of the President press release.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Norma Orozco expressed opposition to the appointment of Napolitano both because of her experience in the Department of Homeland Security and her lack of professional academic experience.</p>\n<p>“This is the president of our university. This is the person that is supposed to make the most critical decisions for universities, such as where our funding goes and where our funding comes from,” Orozco said. “She was in charge of increasing the budgets for our military … that’s not what a university’s about.”</p>\n<p>According to Armbruster-Sandoval, Napolitano should respond to student protest and demand for a public forum if she wants to save face as the rightful president of the UC.</p>\n<p>“So the idea is to say, ‘Hey we’re not happy with this, listen to us,’” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “Apologize, do something, show some contrition, show that you’re a human being, that you have some heart, basically, because you’ve broken our hearts.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"500598246\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"53199\"><img data-attachment-id=\"53201\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/protesters-express-outrage-over-napolitanos-exclusive-meeting-with-ucsb-student-leaders/napolitano-protest-johnclow_11-21-2013-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1385052985\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-53201\" alt=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Commission on Student Well-Being, an organization dedicating to promoting healthy practices among UCSB students through various events and services.</p>\n<p>The measure constitutes one of two new A.S. fee initiatives on the ballot this year along with a proposal for a lock-in fee supporting the A.S. weekly newspaper, <i>The Bottom Line</i>. Of the total $1.03 fee, $.71 will go towards the organization, while the remainder will be put towards financial aid and covering administrative fees.</p>\n<p>Lisa Schwartz, a COWSB spokesperson and a current Peer Pre-Health Advisor at the Academic Advising Office, said the goal of the initiative is to gain funding for events that would enrich the physical and mental health of UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“The Associated Students Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) is committed to the general wellbeing of UCSB undergraduates, with a particular emphasis on mental wellbeing,” Schwartz said. “Its purpose is to increase awareness, educate, and advocate for students. COSWB also creates many programs that provide a positive and comfortable environment for students on campus.”</p>\n<p>COSWB currently holds weekly free fitness class at the UCEN and in Isla Vista, including yoga, Krav Maga, kickboxing and hip-hop dancing. In addition, COSWB hosts events that educate students on healthy eating habits, mental health issues and other health-related topics, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>“A few weeks ago we had a bounce house. It was amazing to watch the difference in people’s demeanor as they left feeling rejuvenated and refreshed,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Should the fee initiative pass, COSWB’s plan is to expand on the services they already provide for students, according to fourth-year biopsychology major.</p>\n<p>“We plan to lead off campus trips that will be available at no additional charge for students,” Schwartz said. “These events include whale watching, day trips and camping at the Channel Islands, game trucks and additional fitness classes both in IV and on campus.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3070,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3069,3068,3067],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Candidates Discuss Student Conduct, Compete for Advocate General Position","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In the last candidate forum before elections next week, Jorge Villela and Kristian Whittaker took part in a debate for the position of Student Advocate General, discussing topics such as the Conduct B...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the last candidate forum before elections next week, Jorge Villela and Kristian Whittaker took part in a debate for the position of Student Advocate General, discussing topics such as the Conduct Board proposed by the Associate Dean of Students.</p>\n<p>As a position without party affiliation, the role of the Student Advocate General is to promote justice and impartiality within UCSB by giving students the tools and information necessary to navigate the legal process at UCSB. The Student Advocate General assists students who are charged with violating the University Code of Student Conduct, and students charged of such misconduct are expected to undergo.</p>\n<p>When asked their opinion on the new Conduct Board that aims to judge and potentially punish student groups, both candidates said students should have active involvement in this legal process.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major Villela said he would make sure to keep a constant presence at the Conduct Board meetings, despite some logistical obstacles to this goal.</p>\n<p>“As far as Conduct Boards, I feel that it is still my space to go and represent these students, so no matter what, I’m still going to be there,” Villela said. “Even though I’m not allowed to say anything, I’m still allowed to ask for time-outs.”</p>\n<p>Whittaker argued that the idea of a conduct board was unfair to students, and said he would fight to gain a greater student voice in this matter.</p>\n<p>“I feel that it’s personally attacking the students on an underhanded level,” Whittaker said. “I have found that most student conduct cases are mistakes — mistakes that most students overlook or just simply forgot … I feel like the Student Advocate General needs a push for an actual say — to actually represent the students in these cases with an actual voice.”</p>\n<p>In regards to past student advocacy efforts, Whittaker said his time on the A.S. Senate and his involvement in creating a group project seeking student input are two experiences that directly qualify him for the position. Whittaker said he plans to change the usual procedures for the position, making a greater effort to assist student defendants.</p>\n<p>“Myself and the four other on-campus legislative council members have definitely felt that our constituents … were not directly represented. However, it was our fault … we were not going to these residence halls as we should have been,” Whittaker said. “Thus we created our group project … we did not wait for them to come to us — we went to them.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Villela mentioned his role in starting Educational Opportunity Program Step Up[[ok]], which raised over $20,000 for the Educational Opportunity Program. Introducing the new program required a sense of initiative that Villela said he would bring to the role of Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>“EOP, as many of you know, are for first-generation students … EOP got hit hard, just as a lot of things on this campus got hit hard, and what happened was — I was a part of a two-week program, and what they were going to do was to cut it down to five days,” Villela said. “So what I did, during my first year along with 10 other people, was to create this program called Step Up.”</p>\n<p>Since the Student Advocate General must regularly resolve student conflicts on a large scale, candidates were also questioned on their ability to come to an effective and fair decision.</p>\n<p>Villela said his time as a Resident Assistant has given him first-hand experience in dealing with a variety of personal conflicts between students, and Villela said he plans to provide students undergoing the university judicial process with a “safe, confidential space.”</p>\n<p>“As a Resident Assistant, I deal with conflicts all the time. We had a very conservative [student], and then we had a student that was a part of the LGBT community, and then a student that was not supportive of that…it was a space for me…to figure out how to best work with each other,” Villela said.</p>\n<p>Whittaker, on the other hand, cited a personal experience when he had had to deal with his own roommate’s misconceptions about his queer identity.</p>\n<p>“In mid-winter, I got a new roommate and I hadn’t met this person before, so they came in and I guess the roommate didn’t know that I was a queer person … I guess that he didn’t feel too comfortable with me and my sexuality,” Whittaker said. “To be honest, a lot of his complications with me were misconceptions about the queer community … so it definitely just came through education, definitely letting him know a lot of the things he believed about queer people were false.”</p>\n<p>When asked how they would maintain truthfulness and accountability within the Office of the Student Advocate General, Villela said that he would be sure to remain nonpartisan and create a Facebook page for the office to reach out to students. Whittaker said he would create an ‘advocacy agenda’ by the fifth week of Fall 2013, which would expand analytical research in the office.</p>\n<p>In their final statements, both candidates stressed their commitment to the student body. Whittaker said he wants to push for more clarified definitions of policies for students, whereas Villela said he would ensure that the Office of Student Advocacy is a safe place for any student who needs it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1822965026\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50949\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50952\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/candidates-discuss-student-conduct-compete-for-advocate-general-position/as-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366215104\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"117\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50952\" alt=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12-250x133.jpg?resize=250%2C133\" width=\"250\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>ALEX GONZALES / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6> Student Advocate General candidates debated issues related to judicial affairs on campus yesterday.
