The panelists shared stories from their years working for non-profits, emphasizing the methods their organizations use to help prisoners through the re-entry process.</p>\n<p>Dodge founded Crossroads Inc., a non-profit organization providing support to incarcerated women, and said female prisoners should not be defined by crimes they commit.</p>\n<p>“We are more than our worse mistake,” Dodge said. “There’s much more to us. People need the opportunity to make change within their life and I think as a community we need to be willing to accept them, [and] allow that change to happen to welcome them back into the community.”</p>\n<p>Starr co-founded Freedom4Youth, a non-profit organization working with incarcerated youth, and said organizations like hers provide necessary skills and support to empower incarcerated youth and help them overcome their traumatic upbringings.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is hurt people, hurt people,” Starr said. “There hasn’t been one boy or girl that’s come in and said ‘Life is so great, I’ve had it easy and I just decided I was going to steal a car one day.’ It’s always something traumatic in the youths’ lives and that trauma has impacted them in a variety of ways … that has fractured their soul. It’s really about taking that fracture and helping and empowering them to repair it on their own.”</p>\n<p>Starr said the most important thing Freedom4Youth does is work with troubled youth through direct consultation without judgment or expectation.</p>\n<p>“We just see them for who they are and we see the best in them and we listen to them,” Starr said. “Overall that’s one of the greatest gifts that you could give to someone, because by listening to them, then they’ll come to their own conclusions. They’ll realize their own dreams. And we just provide that vehicle for them and support them.”</p>\n<p>Clifford works with Freedom to Choose Foundation, a non-profit organization offering education workshops to California inmates on personal responsibility, and said she hopes her adolescent stint in prison will help her reach out to people in similar situations.</p>\n<p>“It’s about instilling hope and meeting people where they are at,” Clifford said. “I was in prison when my father died, when I was twelve … I’m grateful for my experience because I have a purpose in life and hopefully I can educate people and make myself vulnerable to others to ask me questions.”</p>\n<p>Clifford said the Freedom to Choose Foundation changed her life by helping her deal with personal issues involving self-judgment.</p>\n<p>“A lot of my change came when I stopped judging my feelings and myself as good or bad,” Clifford said. “Not being good enough or not measuring up or fitting in. When I stopped judging those feelings and I started just being present, it changed everything and I stopped judging others. And I put aside the expectations that I had on others.”</p>\n<p>Starr said she also relates to the “at risk” youth she works with in the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“I was that at-risk youth … we grew up in a trailer park … my mom was a teenage mom. I never thought of college or a future, and so I have an understanding of where the youth that I work with come from,” Starr said.</p>\n<p>According to Starr, strong supportive mentors in her life helped her realize her worth amidst adversity.</p>\n<p>“[They] helped me realize, ‘Hey I have a choice. I don’t have to go down the same road that my parents went down and I can make different choices and I’m worth it,’” Starr said.</p>\n<p>Dodge said more people need to get involved in helping recently released prisoners re-enter society.</p>\n<p>“People think the work that I do is extraordinary. I don’t,” Dodge said. “It seems extraordinary to people because there’s not enough people doing it.”</p>\n<p>Assistant University Librarian for Outreach and Academic Collaboration Rebecca Metzger said events like the prisoner re-entry panel are vital to present to students because it brings new perspectives on life outside university.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes at a university it can be kind of a closed environment where you don’t hear a lot about the experiences of the people outside the walls of the university,” Metzger said. “So with this program we were trying to bring those voices in and create a space to have conversations.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Rachel Dahan said she found the panel discussion to be “empowering” because of its wide relatability.</p>\n<p>“It is relatable for everyone,” Dahan. “We can’t just say ‘They are other people’ or that ‘It doesn’t matter because it’s not my fault they should be punished’ because they are people and this is a very important issue.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

<em>Courtesy of “The Laura Flanders Show”</em></p></div>\n<p>“The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.”</p>\n<p>Those were some of the opening lines of Malcolm X’s speech at the funeral of Ronald Stokes in 1962.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 56 years to 2018, Kimberlé Crenshaw would argue X’s statements still ring true.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday, April 25, attendees at Campbell Hall heard the words of Crenshaw, who popularized the concept of “intersectionality” nearly three decades ago. The event was organized by UC Santa Barbara’s MultiCultural Center and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.law.columbia.edu/pt-br/news/2017/06/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality\">Q&amp;A interview with Columbia Law School last year</a>, Crenshaw defined intersectionality as follows:</p>\n<p>“Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.”</p>\n<p>A well-established scholar of critical race theory and law, Crenshaw spoke in front of a packed Campbell Hall audience.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply give a lecture to the audience, Crenshaw used a simulated dialogue between the late Martin Luther King Jr. and her colleague, renowned civil right activist and law expert, Barbara Arnwine.</p>\n<p>The imagined conversation gave life to Crenshaw’s intersectionality theory beyond what people have read or written on a page. Crenshaw told the audience the conversation was a reminder that although King strived for social justice, black women were not accounted for enough.</p>\n<p>Through Arnwine, she spoke about the way that prominent individuals like King and U.S. President Barack Obama upheld patriarchal beliefs.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major and black studies minor Nisa Smith said Crenshaw’s identity being similar to her own “made everything extra important” because she didn’t just talk about racism in a “one-dimensional” way.</p>\n<p>“People tend to only care about liberation as it pertains to them only. I feel like people are not always truly willing to do the work to eradicate their own privilege. Even if you are marginalized in your own way, you are also privileged in some way,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw discussed modern movements that have shed light on the role of black women in the U.S. #SayHerName is a movement created to bring awareness for black women who have lost their lives to police brutality and still have not been given justice.</p>\n<p>The words have been used in references to the killing of Sandra Bland, but before Bland’s name was even mentioned at Campbell Hall on Wednesday, a segment of Crenshaw’s dialogue asked audience members to hold their hands above their head if they recognized the names of victims of police brutality.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw first announced the names of black men such as Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and countless others associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, in which a majority of the audience’s hands remained up.</p>\n<p>However, once she listed the names of black women who are victims – Natasha McKenna, Michelle Cusseaux, India Beaty, Maya Hall and more – many started putting their hands down after the mentioning of just one name.</p>\n<p>As all hands in the lecture hall were no longer lifted, Crenshaw left a moment of silence intended to serve as a wakeup call showing the need for intersectionality and why it was created.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw’s perspective was not lost on the audience, including Smith, who said women should be given more recognition than they are currently given.</p>\n<p>“Black women are experiencing violence on the account of both their race and gender at minimum. These things shouldn’t have to be constantly said. People have to be bullied into giving recognition, attention and respect to black women,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Ingrid Banks, professor of black studies at UCSB, said she often uses Crenshaw’s work in her classes and lauded her influence in activism and academia.</p>\n<p>“One of Professor Crenshaw’s most important scholarly contributions is that she brilliantly argues that the limitations of anti-discriminatory theory beg for an intersectional approach in both Black Studies and Feminist Studies,” Banks said in an email.</p>\n<p>Banks said Crenshaw’s work is not “arrested” within academia and that her work often transcends into activism.</p>\n<p>“Her scholarly work finds legs in the activist efforts she makes on behalf of black girls and women. Both her scholarship and activism bleed intersectionality,” Banks said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story was printed on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/","id":2849,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[2848,2847,2846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Academic Senate Lifts 2014 Freeze on CCS Lit Admissions","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Academic Senate has lifted a 2014 admissions freeze placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2015.

This article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate has lifted a <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/academic-senate-approves-suspension-of-admissions-to-ccs-literature-major/\">2014 admissions freeze</a> placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Admission to the program was suspended on a temporary basis last year by the Undergraduate Council over concerns regarding program leadership, lack of adequate involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty and an underdeveloped relationship with other campus departments.  The Senate approved the decision to lift the freeze by the Undergraduate Council at a meeting last week on Feb. 12.  The suspension of admissions did not affect the degree trajectories of students already enrolled in the program.</p>\n<p>According to Undergraduate Council Executive Director Deborah Karoff, admission to the program was reinstated after the concerns leading to its suspension were addressed and resolved with efforts by multiple campus departments and faculty members.</p>\n<p>“The College of Creative Studies and several other departments on campus worked together to strengthen the involvement of Senate faculty in the program,” Karoff said.</p>\n<p>According to Karoff, it is a norm at the university that Senate-affiliated faculty participate in major programs of all the departments on campus. Karoff also said a number of individual Senate faculty and campus departments have made commitments to support the program in the future in a way sufficient enough to convince the Undergraduate Council to lift the freeze.</p>\n<p>Dean of CCS and professor of paleobiology Bruce Tiffney said the program suffered from lack of a “coherent curriculum” in place to develop foundational skills for literature students.</p>\n<p>“The program did not have a coherent curriculum put together that was allowing students to both clearly develop in their skills as both students of literature and of writing,” Tiffney said. “[The program] was not set up in a manner that would ensure that they would get out and be taking a range of courses outside and encountering these really wonderful faculty the campus has.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney said the decline of Senate-affiliated faculty over the years took place as part of a historical process of faculty engagement issues. He also mentioned that all other programs in CCS except literature have at least one Senate lecturer in their roster, which are faculty members in CCS and its equivalent academic department in the College of Letters and Science. According to Tiffney, a search is underway for a candidate to hold that dual position.</p>\n<p>“That individual will then be a core leader in the program … who has feet in both Letters and Science and CCS,” Tiffney said. “Now that this has been lifted, the is primary focus is to go and … can run a search.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney also said the CCS literature program historically has had a strong creative writing background in its instruction, but that other aspects of literary study were less prominent in the program. According to Tiffney, the program’s name may be changed to CCS Writing and Literature to reflect the greater breadth that comes with more faculty engagement as well as curricular changes. The curricular changes will reflect the increase of involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty as well as structural changes associated with the program’s foundational material.</p>\n<p>“In the past we did not have a set of courses that in essence built from the bottom up and developed a sense of knowledge from the campus of resources of expected areas of expertise,” Tiffney said. “What we are doing here — we did not have this before — would be a sequence of courses that would develop a background in literature … creative writing and then writing studies.”</p>\n<p>CCS literature instructor Angela Holzmeister said she is pleased the program will accept admissions for the coming academic year.</p>\n<p>“My experience teaching literature courses in CCS has been a tremendously gratifying one, due, not in the least, to the impressively intelligent students I’ve had the pleasure of working with this year,” Holzmeister said in an email. “These students are not only testimony to the quality of students admitted into CCS, but they are also the product of the education they receive at CCS.”</p>\n<p>The program will still undergo certain changes as it reopens for admissions, including unapproved curricular and name changes that will be considered at a March 12 meeting of the Academic Senate.</p>\n<p>CCS literature alumnus and current Community Manager of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Tony Pierce said he was pleased with the change in fortune for the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m super relieved that the university has realized that they have a hidden flower patch in CCS Lit that should just be left alone to bloom,” Pierce said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in a statement that he is thankful to the various faculty and administrative officials who helped oversee the program’s return.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that … Dean Bruce Tiffney and his administrative colleagues have overseen a successful proposal to revitalize CCS’s literature program,” Yang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/","id":2850,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2849,2848,2847],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Talks i>Clicker Rental Updates, GE Modifications","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night at the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss resolutions regarding the support of curricular changes in general education, senators’ workload, devel...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61363\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61363\" data-attachment-id=\"61363\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/senate-talks-iclicker-rental-updates-ge-modifications/senate_lorenzo-basilio-1-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424890220\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"125\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate 2/25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61363\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"A.S.

Senate members listen intently as their fellow students present issues to be discussed. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night at the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss resolutions regarding the support of curricular changes in general education, senators’ workload, developments in the i&gt;Clicker rental program, recent grants from the Finance and Business Committee and the development of an A.S. lobbying group.</p>\n<p>The meeting included a debate regarding whether an additional gender and sexuality course should be required for graduation. A.S. Controller and fourth-year electrical engineering major Amir Khazaieli updated the senate on the i&gt;Clicker rental program and continuing issues as the program prepares to be launched. Finance and Business Committee Chair and fourth-year communication major Jimmy Villarreal outlined funding the committee has allotted to student groups this year.</p>\n<p>Senator and fourth-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez informed the senate of developments in Assembly member Das Williams’ Isla Vista self-governance bill AB 3, introduced in the state assembly to make I.V. a Community Services District (CSD). Lopez said the <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/\">recent issuance of a letter of concern</a> from the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a setback in the progression of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“We passed our resolution last Wednesday and then the next day myself and a number of other senators went to the LAFCO meeting. We spoke with a lot of other students and a lot of homeowners, which is big because a lot of homeowners were not down with AB 3 at the beginning,” Lopez said. “We felt that they should not pass a letter of concern, but as it LAFCO’s way, they passed a letter of concern anyway.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said the stakeholders group compiled a list of things they would like to see in the bill language for the CSD and voted to send it to the legislature for potential amendments to keep the bill in action.</p>\n<p>“We had our discussion to find out what is palatable for everyone, sent it in, and then that will be coming back to us hopefully after we have the financial sustainability report,” Lopez said. “Then we can put together the actual bill that will be discussed on the floor.”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini told the Senate about recent developments in her nascent student lobbying group. According to Mancini, the group plans to advocate on behalf of students politically and will be soliciting input from student groups.</p>\n<p>“We filled out a sheet with all the orgs we’re going to reach out to, and there’s quite a few of them, hopefully about 30,” Mancini said. “At our next meeting we’re going to identify our lobby targets so that’s going to be an important meeting.”</p>\n<p>Senators debated the Resolution Supporting the Establishment of a Gender and Sexuality GE Requirement, a resolution that would support additional graduation requirements regarding gender and sexuality courses.</p>\n<p>Lopez said he supports the resolution because it brings wider attention to less recognized courses.“There are classes that already cover these subject matters,” Lopez said. “[We should] just give them more recognition and … get majors that don’t usually deal with these sort of courses the opportunity to. The UC is something that should have more of a holistic education.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he supported the resolution but doubted the level of student support for the idea of advocacy for extra GE courses.</p>\n<p>“I like this resolution. I do want to point that not every student is cool with extra duties,” Villarreal said. “Since they come to school and want to get out of here and get a job and [are] not necessarily going to support extra GEs.”</p>\n<p>Senator and third-year political science and global studies major Kevin Koo said he supported the resolution and that the university’s progressive academic policies is part of his reason for doing so.</p>\n<p>“Universities are meant to grow and that’s the whole point of this,” Koo said. “It stands as a very good example of the generation that we’re in and that this is more and more a growing issue and that’s why I’m personally in favor of it.”</p>\n<p>Koo responded to Villarreal’s concerns about the lack of student support saying students would agree to the take the GE courses if they are presented as simply a regular part of the GE curriculum.</p>\n<p>“If they come in from the start knowing this is a GE, then everyone will just think that’s normal and it’s not like ‘Oh I have to do more work,’” Koo said. “It’s just gonna be ‘Oh yeah this is just part of the GE package.’”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year student Haywood Hunter said he personally supports the resolution, but voted against it citing that his position is to be representative of all students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea, I would vote for it, but I represent a lot of students who would look at this as an attempt to increase units,” Hunter said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau gave a brief summary of an average senator’s workload to address her perception that the student public is not aware of how much work senators do.</p>\n<p>“I’m really concerned that people don’t know what you all do. So I had [Government Affairs advisor] Cory [Graves] help me put together a spreadsheet detailing out how many hours an average senator actually spends doing senate work,” Lau said. “This does not include any time you spent meeting with administrators, any time you spent going to local meetings, or group projects that you all have done.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, senators also spend a lot of time reading emails, preparing for meetings and reviewing previous meetings’ minutes.</p>\n<p>“I know you all get at least 20 emails a day because I get at least 120 emails a day, but I’m sure you each get at least 20 that are relatively important that you have to read,” Lau said. “You all have to read through bills and resolutions as well as all the minutes that are sent out from all the boards and commissions in Associated Students.”</p>\n<p>Lau said it is important for senators to perform their duties on top of their schoolwork.</p>\n<p>“In total, at the very minimum, the average senator spends about 14.8 hours doing senate work,” Lau said. “So I just hope that everyone is aware of that and is aware that we are also students here.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli updated the senate on difficulties regarding the introduction of his <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/\">office’s i&gt;clicker rental program</a>. According to Khazaieli, technical issues with the website have prevented the online sign up process from being launched.</p>\n<p>“The i&gt;clicker program ran into a little bit of a hiccup getting the website up because we were kind of busy with the whole server side of things,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said that if the issues continue, the office will need a backup plan to finish its program implementation efforts.</p>\n<p>“So if we’re not able to do an online rental kind of reservation thing, we’re going to have to either come up with some plan B or maybe ask for permission to allow us to do the website,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Villarreal updated the senate on the funding the Finance and Business Committee has provided to student groups this past academic year. According to Villarreal, A.S. has granted $419,497 to 253 campus groups as of week seven of Winter quarter.</p>\n<p>“Whenever we’re questioned about how effective Associated Students is or how we help the students out, that’s how,” Villarreal said. “We provide over $400,000 worth of funding to groups so that they can put on their events, whether big or small, here or on the other side of the country, and they’re representing UCSB and making UCSB a better school.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61387\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/senate-talks-iclicker-rental-updates-ge-modifications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61387\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/senate-talks-iclicker-rental-updates-ge-modifications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/senate-talks-iclicker-rental-updates-ge-modifications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/senate-talks-iclicker-rental-updates-ge-modifications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/senate-talks-iclicker-rental-updates-ge-modifications/","id":2851,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2850,2849,2848],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
