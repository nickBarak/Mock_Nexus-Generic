The suspects were last seen fleeing on foot eastbound on Del Playa.</p>\n<p>Hoover said both victims were transported to a local hospital, and the stabbing victim sustained serious injuries. Neither of the victims’ names or current conditions had been released as of Sunday night.</p>\n<p>An emergency notification was sent out to the campus community shortly after officers arrived on the scene. Anyone with information about the incident is encouraged to contact the UCSB Police Department at (805) 893-3446 or leave an anonymous tip on the Sherriff’s Office’s website.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #780c0e;\">[Update (3:30 p.m.): The two victims were Santa Barbara City College students, according to Hoover.]</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/officers-search-for-suspects-after-dp-stabbing-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/officers-search-for-suspects-after-dp-stabbing-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/officers-search-for-suspects-after-dp-stabbing-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/officers-search-for-suspects-after-dp-stabbing-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/officers-search-for-suspects-after-dp-stabbing-assault/","id":3821,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3820,3819,3818],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp","biography":"Not available","articles":[3105,3127,3130,3160,3477,3485,3821],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Following a somewhat high-speed chase through the streets of Isla Vista, I.V.

Foot Patrol officers apprehended a suspect — dressed, painted and hair-sprayed entirely green — on suspicion of public intoxication and disorderly conduct shortly after midnight on Nov. 1.</p>\n<p>After the jolly green reveler noticed that he had caught the attention of local authorities, he strolled into oncoming traffic in opposition to officers’ requests that he accompany them to the curb for a sobriety test and narrowly avoided being struck by a westbound vehicle. The emerald escapist then fled on foot up Del Playa Drive, promptly colliding with a stop sign on the corner of Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>However, the Green Lantern never gives up without a fight and, in a superhuman feat of agility, remained upright and continued his flight with several deputies in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the hope that his green face paint and hair coloring would serve as better camouflage off the street, the fleet-footed suspect sought refuge in a nearby residence on DP. As the cops followed him into the house, he made a ninja turtle-worthy leap over the back fence into another nearby residence.</p>\n<p>Following the indignant cries of the Del Playa residents — none of whom wished to press trespassing charges — officers eventually apprehended the mischievous leprechaun inside a third DP residence.</p>\n<p>Upon his arrest, the captured fugitive articulated that he wanted to provide deputies with a formal statement. However, after the suspect was transferred to the I.V. Foot Patrol station for processing, his remarks were found to be incoherent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/","id":3818,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3817,3816,3815],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up April 23, 2013","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"During this past weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several burglaries and alcohol-related crimes.

Steinhorn is being charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Santa Barbara County police officials also arrested two Santa Barbara residents for possession of half an ounce of heroin, which holds an estimated street value of $1,500. One of the suspects, 29-year-old Donald Windsor, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, transportation of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia while 25-year-old Cassidy Morse was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p>Although Steinhorn was initially booked into Santa Barbara County with his bail set at $30,000, he was released on March 22 and is expected to appear in court again on April 25. Both Windsor and Morse are being held at Santa Barbara County jail, with Windor’s bail set at $35,000. Morses’s bail is set at $2,500, although he is not currently eligible for bail as he had an active felony warrant for his arrest at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>— Staff report</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/","id":3820,"author":{"id":271,"name":"Nexus Staff Report"},"related":[3819,3818,3817],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
