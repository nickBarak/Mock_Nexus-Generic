It’s not surprising that, with all the stress that comes with it, many new students gain the dreaded “freshman fifteen.” A study published in <em>Nutrition Journal</em> found that nearly a quarter of freshmen gain at least five percent of their body weight during their first semester, an average of about ten whopping pounds in just a few months!</p>\n<p>In an effort to help students look and feel great, the movement toward offering more plant-based meals is taking root on college campuses nationwide. In fact, there are more than 200 universities leading the charge with Meatless Monday programs in their dining halls.</p>\n<p>Why take a weekly holiday from meat? In recent decades, our meat consumption has increased dramatically — and along with it, our waistlines, blood pressure and cholesterol. Meat is high in saturated fat which is associated with obesity and preventable chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, some cancers and stroke.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A study by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found that there is a strong association between meat consumption and obesity. A review published in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> concluded, “[A] plant-based diet seems to be a sensible approach for the prevention of obesity[…].”</p>\n<p>Even if we can’t switch to a completely plant-based diet, we can make incremental changes. Kaiser Permanente is one of the nation’s largest healthcare and insurance providers. It recently published a “Plant-Based Diet” guide that states: “Any movement toward more plants and fewer animal products can improve your health.”</p>\n<p>Eating more healthy, plant-based meals not only helps our physical health, but can also lighten our carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture is “one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.” Factory farms — where nearly all of our meat comes from — are major culprits in climate change. These animal factories create huge amounts of manure that pollute the soil, water and air.</p>\n<p>And of course reducing the amount of meat we eat is good for animals, too.  The fewer animals we raise for food means less pressure on animal agriculture to raise them in cruel and intensive ways. For example, large demand for meat has led to the practice of genetically manipulating chickens to grow so obese so quickly that many can’t even walk more than a few steps before collapsing. To help animals, the Humane Society of the United States advocates the Three Rs: “reducing” or “replacing” consumption of animal products, and “refining” our diets by switching to products from sources that adhere to higher animal welfare standards.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, it’s never been easier to take a positive step toward safeguarding our health while also protecting the planet and helping animals. Choosing simple, delicious options once a week can make a big difference. How about swapping those chicken nuggets with meat-free nuggets? Or choosing veggie and bean burritos instead of carnitas burritos? Eating out is easy, too. With options like Chipotle and Denny’s serving up hearty meat-free fare and with Indian, Thai and Mexican restaurants that regularly offer delicious plant-based dishes, the options are endless.</p>\n<p><em>Bon appétit!</em></p>\n<p>Eddie Garza is a food policy coordinator for The Humane Society of the United States.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56195\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56195\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/","id":5765,"author":{"id":628,"name":"Eddie Garza"},"related":[5764,5763,5762],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":628,"name":"Eddie Garza","biography":"Not available","articles":[5765],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"C.A.P.S.’s C+ Grade Needs Improvement, Investment","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/report.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/report.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Members of the office of the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs at UCSB offer a response to C.A.P.S.'s recent C+ grade given by the University of California Student Association.

Across the UC system and here at UCSB, the university’s insufficient support for student mental health services makes this far from a reality. According to the American College Health Association, 30 percent of college students report being too depressed to function. One in five college students will be diagnosed with depression during their undergraduate career. For the past three years, the number of new students seen by UCSB’s Counseling And Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has increased by an average of 26 percent. While C.A.P.S. has expanded and continues to support an increasing number of students, the amount of funding provided to our mental health services at UCSB does not meet the needs of our student body. This disconnect between C.A.P.S.’s needs and its capacity has been damaging.<br>\nStudents have expressed dissatisfaction in the wait times for appointments. Clinicians are not provided adequate space and room accommodations. In a setting where we want to promote racial and gender equity, our counseling staff does not adequately reflect the diversity of our student body. Furthermore, the culture of our campus is not yet one that entirely fosters mental health.<br>\n“#HowAreYou: A Call to Reform Student Mental Health Services” is a UC Student Association (UCSA) campaign working to improve the accessibility, diversity and outreach in mental health services at each UC. UCSA has created an expansive rubric in order to grade mental health services on each campus. The rubric measures certain aspects of our counseling services, such as wait times, the trend in intake appointments, the diversity of clinicians, Full Time Equivalent (FTE)-to-student ratio, etc. in order to diagnose areas in which C.A.P.S. can improve. As a result of this study, UCSA awarded UCSB’s C.A.P.S. a grade of C+.<br>\nThis grade is not to criticize C.A.P.S. or C.A.P.S. Staff, who have worked innovatively to improve services with the limited resources they have, but rather to bring to light the damage that comes when such vital student resources are allowed to be under resourced. We hope that this serves as a call to action, both for the community to be more aware of the services and its necessary changes and for UCSB administration to do more about improving this vital service on campus.<br>\nUCSB’s C.A.P.S. excels as they allow students to be seen the same day that they come and express they need help. Other campuses have same day appointments, but only for students exhibiting signs of crisis, and some have no kinds of same day appointments at all. These walk-in appointments are a unique innovation — started at UCSB — that maximize the potential of our clinical staff while also setting our campus up to be one that provides resources on a needs basis. However, this does not support students who require long-term care, because follow-up appointments must still be scheduled weeks in advance.<br>\nUCSB also leads in counseling services, compared to the other UCs, with our mental health peer program, in which students work with C.A.P.S. to provide resources to others in need. C.A.P.S. has excelled in preventing suicide with our #SaySomething campaign, and has made great strides in supporting our black students in response to a series of demands made by the Black Student Union in 2013.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68781\" style=\"width: 593px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68781\" data-attachment-id=\"68781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/ucsb-caps-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"594,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB CAPS 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2-250x161.png?resize=583%2C376\" alt=\"Image courtesy of UCSA\" width=\"583\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?w=594&amp;ssl=1 594w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of UCSA</p></div>\n<p>These are the things that we must do to ensure that students will receive adequate mental health services:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The hiring of more diverse and culturally competent clinicians:</strong></p>\n<p>National trends indicate that people of color use mental health services at a lower rate than their white counterparts. African Americans and Chican@/Latin@ Americans used mental health services at about one half the rate of Caucasian Americans in the past year. In the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) community, that rate shrank to one third. Studies have shown that matching the race and sex of the therapist to that of the client increases the acceptability and effectiveness of treatment services. As a Hispanic Serving Institution, UCSB should not be this drastically lacking Hispanic serving clinicians. Thus, the hiring of API, Chican@/Latin@, South Asian, Middle Eastern and North African serving clinicians is a must.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The expansion and improvement of the C.A.P.S. building:</strong></p>\n<p>Accessibility and comfort are necessary for fostering an environment that supports mental health. Our current facility is struggling for space. With a new state of the art facility at UCSB, students will be able to receive care with more comfort and convenience. Climate controlled, spacious and confidential spaces have proven to help students in therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The integration of mental health services in academic and student life:</strong></p>\n<p>Placing a therapist in the residence halls provides more benefits than just the ease in accessibility. When therapists are in the residence halls, it contributes to an environment in which the residents understand that support is around them and accessible to them when they need it. For this reason, therapists should be placed wherever there is a high density of students, including residence halls, university apartments and areas on campus where stigma around mental health can be greater, like the S.T.E.M. buildings.<br>\nThe university should be a place where students thrive, not just endure. The changes we are calling for will allow us to address long wait times and short staffing and can create an environment on campus where we can truly care for all of us, especially those populations that are most vulnerable. This past summer, a group of UC students who were tired of week-long waiting times for their friends, frustrated with C.A.P.S. centers that didn’t have therapists that came from their communities and who believed deeply in the need to create a culture of compassion launched the #HowAreYou campaign. As students, we made improving our mental health services our priority; it’s time our administration did the same.</p>\n<p>Signed,<br>\nSiavash Zohoori, Mental Health Coordinator<br>\nLillian Cain, Policy Analyst<br>\nMohsin Mirza, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs<br>\nAnumita Kaur, Campus Organizing Director</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/","id":5762,"author":{"id":402,"name":"Siavash Zohoori"},"related":[5761,5760,5759],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why I (actually) Feel the Bern","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Chalk-Bernie4President_Courtesy-of-BernieSandersVideo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Chalk-Bernie4President_Courtesy-of-BernieSandersVideo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Felicia Balli talks about why she truly feel the Bern. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “Millennial.” I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “young woman in my 20s following a popular trend.” Put simply, I am voting for Bernie Sanders because I am educated. Now, I am not quite caught up on nuclear physics, and I would probably struggle a bit on any given biology exam (props to you, science majors … y’all the real MVPs), but I am also not the type to undervalue my political science degree and minor in women, development and culture as an “easy ride through the social sciences on my path to an MRS degree” (I can ramble on about that bullsh** stereotype for days, but I’m excited you’re still even reading this, so I will abstain from my desire to digress). </p>\n<blockquote><p>We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Admittedly, I haven’t always been interested in politics. In fact, I got into UCSB as an econ major and was weeded out by the econ majors that were indeed supposed to be there (as well as the ones that wisely chose not to thoroughly damage their livers the first quarter of freshman year). It wasn’t until my third year that a sociology course — later to become the foundation for my minor — allowed me to look at the bigger picture. I studied women, poverty and exploitation in the third world and was forced to take a hard look at the institutions that perpetuate injustices in these areas. We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass. As it turns out, however, the sources of this evil lie far closer to our realm of familiarity and influence than we realize, protected by a powerful system that we have underestimated and hidden behind a sensationalist media that has underestimated us. I was able to gain a global perspective that considered the genuine suffering of human lives — lives we often denigrate to nothing more than a statistic — and recognized the role politics had played in causing this suffering. The same politics that we get bored of and ignored. The politics that have — due to our lack of attention — fallen into the wrong hands and subsequently the wrong pockets. The United States has historically been the most powerful country in the world, so when we allow multi-billion dollar corporations to buy politicians and thus the votes that deregulate their activity, the repercussions of that are felt all over the world. </p>\n<blockquote><p> Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bernie Sanders is not making history because he is a viral trend amongst young idealists; his popularity has spiked because he has given people faith that we can create a politics that cares about people. He has created a movement that has brought people together from both the left and the right who can all agree that our political system is rigged. Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen. He has shown through record-breaking turnouts and individual contributions that the American people can regain control of our political process. We can no longer accept the narrative that politics are only for politicians. We can no longer fulfill the stereotype that young, educated Americans are more passionate about who wins “The Bachelor” than which American corporations profit from labor exploitation and human rights abuses around the world.  It is not just our duty to our country, but our responsibility to the global community to be politically active citizens who acknowledge that we indeed have the power to change the world.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/","id":5763,"author":{"id":397,"name":"Felicia Balli"},"related":[5762,5761,5760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bernie’s Leftism is Not Americanism: A Response to UCSB For Bernie","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg?resize=682%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A letter to the editor from Howard Sachs responding to UCSB for Bernie's most recent article.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Bernie Sanders with people on and off campus.

These are the values he and you, right now, reject. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was young once too. Most young people are attracted to leftism. I campaigned and voted for George McGovern. Passionate and idealistic, many young people are arrtacted to leftism. They are attracted because leftism is very alluring. It is utopianism- almost a heavenly kind of thing. “All will be pretty much free. We will just take from the greedy rich and distribute it to others and then everyone will have great healthcare, and free college, and a nice warm place to live, a good safe car, no polluting fossil fuels, and plenty of healthy food, good clothing and shelter.”  I know the idea too, “corporations are what are pulling us all down. If only we crush those 20 million dollar a year CEO’s, all will be well again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I tell you, college is just the first tiny step into the world of knowledge, wisdom, experience and idealism. Most people when they leave college and get married, take care of a spouse and kid, start working, start experiencing and understanding the world around them change markedly.  I think they become better people. I think they grow up and become actually more idealistic and more compassionate but with mature ideals and compassion.  They come to understand true morality, maturity and love with American values- not leftist ones.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American values tell us lots and lots of liberty is at the core of our lives. Leftism is about taking and more taking of liberty. That money you have worked hard for is yours, not Bernie’s to give to others who deserve it more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Americanism is about us living in a sea of liberty populated with small islands of government power. Leftism is the opposite. Bernie and his like are about seas of coercion and power populated with small islands of freedom and liberty. Bernie and his massive government’s, after reaching into your pockets and taking most of your property will then will tell you and I what schools to go to, what kind of healthcare to receive, what cars to drive, how to educate our kids, what type of energy to use, how to save for retirement, how much income is enough and what kind of light bulbs we can screw into our desk lamps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But leftism and Bernie are alluring to us all. The child never leaves the core part of our souls. We all yearn to be taken care of from the day we are born to the day we die. But Americanism, American values help us grow up. They help us leave Eden and face the real beautiful and yes challenging adult world out there. Bernie has never really left that world of childhood. He is a kind, decent, well meaning man but stuck in childish fantasies. Good luck to you. I hope you leave college continuing to learn and experience. I wish you well. I hope you someday embrace Americanism as strong, tough, self-reliant and very free people.  I hope you reject someday the mean, coercive, freedom and maturity -crushing ideology of leftism. Life is complex and a challenge for all of us, those on the left and those of us who embrace American values.  Onward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69187\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69187\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/","id":5764,"author":{"id":400,"name":"Howard Sachs"},"related":[5763,5762,5761],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
