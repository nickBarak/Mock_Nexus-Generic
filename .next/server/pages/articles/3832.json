The first theft was Friday, May 7 when five laptops were stolen from a residence on the 6500 block of Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>“The suspect entered into the unlocked house,” Padilla said. “I don’t believe it. These kids need to lock their doors and windows.”</p>\n<p>Several other laptops were stolen throughout the weekend. A computer was stolen from a residence on the 6700 block of Abrego Road on Saturday afternoon and two laptops were stolen from a parked car on Estero Road later that evening.</p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon another theft occurred when a suspect entered an unlocked car on the 6700 block Sabado Tarde Road and stole a laptop computer and a TomTom navigation device.</p>\n<p>Vandals also targeted a number of parked cars this weekend.</p>\n<p>Foot Patrol deputies were called to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road when an unknown suspect shattered the window of a young woman’s vehicle. Deputies also noted several reports of smashed side-view mirrors.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol deputies issued eight citations for public intoxication, in addition to 17 citations for minors in possession of alcohol and possession of open containers in public.</p>\n<p>Despite the alcohol-related crimes and high amount of thefts over the weekend, Deputy Freddy Padilla said no life-threatening incidents took place.</p>\n<p>“There were no violent crimes, nothing outrageous and, thankfully, no sexual assaults this weekend,” Padilla said. “I just hope that these kids lock their cars and houses and keep their valuables out of plain sight.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22567\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22567\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/","id":3832,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3831,3830,3829],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros","biography":"Not available","articles":[3523,3683,3811,3812,3814,3815,3832],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Saturday, Jan. 30, 10:47 p.m. -- A man swaggering down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive couldn't help but draw the gaze of Isla Vista's finest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The King’s Can</b></p>\n<p>Saturday, Jan. 30, 10:47 p.m. — A man swaggering down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but draw the gaze of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>Dripping with sophistication, the 23-year-old man raised a Keystone Light to his lips and, in so doing, brought about his own demise. Seeing this, the officers perked up, happy to enforce their zero tolerance policy, and made their way toward the suave partier.</p>\n<p>Noticing his tail, the Keystone King tucked in behind some cars and ditched his kingly can, but it was too late. The deputies caught up and asked the inebriated man why he was drinking in the street. The Goleta resident, a classy man by nature, took the high road and told them, “I know, I’m drunk in public.”</p>\n<p>Despite the confession, the officers continued to prod and asked the self-described drunk if he knew where he was. Confidently, he answered, “Del Trigo.”</p>\n<p>Convinced he was, in fact, drunk in public, the deputies sat the man on the curb and slapped on handcuffs. With this, the intoxicated man became aggravated and asked his arresting officers, “Why you messing with me? Look at all these people doing cocaine, and shit like that.”</p>\n<p>A quick glance into the street revealed no cocaine, however, and deputies calmly explained why they were “messing” with him. The deputies later transported the man to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>It’s Good, but Not That Good…</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 29, 3:47 p.m. — Domino’s new and improved pizza brought one drunken man to his knees… and into the hands of the law.</p>\n<p>Resisting the allure of fluffy, distinctly cardboard-free crust and bubbling, now-made-from-real-milk cheese, the deputies were walking past the I.V. pizzeria when they spotted the grown man blocking the entrance.</p>\n<p>The 44-year-old — a local resident — was kneeling just in front of the door with a nearly empty 24-ounce bottle of malt liquor sitting beside him. The clearly inebriated man had a wad of crumpled dollar bills in one hand and was yelling at the patrons gathered around him. While his words were unintelligible, one could only guess he was shouting about the greatness that is the new Domino’s pizza.</p>\n<p>As the deputies approached, they watched as the “pizza man” lost his balance and face-planted into the cement. He righted himself, only to fall face-first again. This was repeated several times until the officers arrived and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending discovery of the telephone.</p>\n<p><b>Neighborly Love</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 30, 2:31 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to 6500 block of Seville on reports of a fight.</p>\n<p>Some time earlier, two men had been sitting in their apartment when they heard a knock on their door. They opened it to find their neighbor, heavily intoxicated and royally pissed about something.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old was too drunk to use words however, and instead just punched his neighbor in the face. The motion proved too violent, however, as the inebriated man lost his balance and fell backward down the stairs.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they found the pugnacious partier standing in the courtyard, bleeding from the cheek. The deputies attempted to talk with him, but all he would say was something about his neighbors “disrespecting” him.</p>\n<p>Unable to get any more out of him, the deputies arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/","id":3829,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3828,3827,3826],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Feb. 12, 10:18 p.m. -- Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Pasado Road were alerted to trouble when someone yelled \"Man down!\" from their front door.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Sleepy in Chicago</b><br>\n<i>Fri., Feb. 12, 10:18 p.m.</i> — Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Pasado Road were alerted to trouble when someone yelled “Man down!” from their front door.</p>\n<p>The deputies walked over and found a young man, his clothes soiled with dirt and God knows what else, completely passed out in the gravel beside the driveway of the house.</p>\n<p>After unsuccessfully attempting to wake the defeated drunkard, the officers called in the medical response team on fears of alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old man, who woke as the paramedics arrived, was not happy and repeatedly shouted “fuck” and asked why it was necessary for them to assist him.</p>\n<p>After getting the OK from the paramedics, the officers arrested the inebriated, insolent man for public intoxication. He was put in a patrol car, at which time he told the deputies that he commutes from Chicago to Santa Barbara City College every day to attend school.</p>\n<p>Thinking to themselves that SBCC isn’t even worth the commute from I.V., the officers kept driving towards the Santa Barbara County Jail, where they housed the likely corrupt young man, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>From Russia, With Love</b><br>\n<i>Fri., Feb. 12, 11:18 p.m.</i> — The Isla Vista Foot Patrol was called to action when officers spotted a young man carrying a bottle of vodka down Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>The officers approached the young man, who was an extra shade of pale, and grabbed him by the arm. When asked his age, the inebriated man told them he was 21. The deputies wanted to see his ID, however, and, releasing his arm, told him to get it.</p>\n<p>His arm now free, the pasty man made a break for it and started sprinting down the street. His escape was short lived, however, and he was quickly tackled. The deputies searched his pockets and found a passport — a Russian passport.</p>\n<p>The officers arrested the 19-year-old Russian reveler for evading a police officer and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Can You Point Me to the Sex Castles?</b><br>\n<i>Sat., Feb. 13, 1:43 a.m.</i> — An especially rude freshman staggering down the 6700 block of Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>With whiskey on his breath, the 19-year-old had a wicked tongue, shouting obscenities at anyone who passed. When the deputies arrived, however, he sheepishly said, “Hey, man,” and sat when they told him to sit.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the pugnacious partier if he knew where he was, to which he (incorrectly) stated, “Sure I do; I’m on Del Playa.” He told the officers he lived in the Santa Catalina dorms but could not point in their direction.</p>\n<p>With no other recourse, the deputies arrested him and took him to the IVFP Sheriff’s Station, where he promptly threw up. He was then put in a patrol car — where he again vomited — and driven to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where, surprise, he threw up again.</p>\n<p>With nothing left in his stomach, they housed the not-so-fresh prince, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/","id":3830,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3829,3828,3827],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. -- A manly expletive (\"Fuck!\") drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Dishonorably Drunk</b></p>\n<p>Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. — A manly expletive (“Fuck!”) drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.</p>\n<p>Looking around for the source, the deputies spotted a well-built young man staggering down the street, all alone. The officers approached the blatantly drunk man, who was later revealed to be a Marine, to check on his welfare.</p>\n<p>After getting his name, the officers asked how much the 18-year old had had to drink. The muscular war machine informed the officers he had drank an impressive three drinks. Then when asked what he would do in an emergency, the trained military man said he would call his mom.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the intoxicated soldier believed he was in San Bernardino, on his way to Camp Pendleton in San Diego County.</p>\n<p>The officers were forced to inform him, however, that he would instead be heading to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>The Boozer and the Bush</b></p>\n<p>Fri., Feb. 19, 10:42 p.m. — Deputies on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive were put to work when they witnessed a large bush get the better of a passing reveler.</p>\n<p>A clearly intoxicated female was walking westbound down DP when she veered off the sidewalk and into a shrub, which engulfed her inebriated body. After disappearing into its thick foliage, the bush lover was spotted crawling on her hands and knees out of the hedge and back onto the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Back on her feet, the twiggy gal then walked between two parked cars and squatted down. When the deputies arrived some moments later, they caught the young lady with her pants down… literally.</p>\n<p>Averting their eyes, the deputies waited for the 19-year-old woman to do up her pants and then sat her down on the curb to question her. When asked her address, she told the officers she lived at “6622 Abrego.” Seconds later, she told them “6255 Picasso.” Needless to say, neither was correct.</p>\n<p>The lost drunk was given solace, however, when the officers arrested her: She didn’t need to worry about finding a place to sleep. The officers transferred her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/","id":3831,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3830,3829,3828],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
