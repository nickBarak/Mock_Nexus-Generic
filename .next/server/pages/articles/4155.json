Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Aug. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Restorative justice is an approach to justice that… identifies the harm that is done, how can that harm be repaired and who is responsible,” Camarena said, adding that the purpose of such a program is to “strengthen ties between law enforcement and the community they serve.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Isla Vista resident who violates specific Santa Barbara County ordinances – ordinance 36-2: consuming alcohol in public; 36-3: having an open container or 40-2: playing loud music outside of curfew hours – will now have the option of attending a two-hour educational workshop and completing four hours of community service instead of paying a fine. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating these ordinances can cost a maximum of $100 for first violation, $200 for the second violation and $500 for each additional violation that occurs within that same year, Camarena explained. </span></p>\n<p>Foot Patrol Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder added that there are additional court processing and court security fees that can add anywhere from $40 to $100 to the initial fine.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the workshops, individuals will be educated about the section they violated, how that violation affected the community around them and why the ordinance was created in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workshops will be operated by the sheriff’s office, the I.V. CSD, UCSB student organizations and long-term I.V. residents, Camarena said. The program also hopes to also partner with Santa Barbara City College to hold the workshops, as many students who attend the city college also choose to live in I.V., he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if residents choose the workshop and community service route, the violation won’t appear on their permanent record, Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We want] education of the actual violation,” Camarena said, citing the loud music ordinance that prohibits amplified music past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. “[The program] would go into more details of [what it means] to disturb someone’s peace.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also stated there would be an attempt on law enforcement’s part to reach out to the offenders and to ask feedback questions during the workshops, such as “How can we solve this problem that we have here? What things can we share with the community to prevent these types of violations?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the community service branch of the program, offenders will primarily work with the I.V. Recreation and Park District and the I.V. CSD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The program] will educate the offenders of the consequences of their actions… I believe it will build trust and legitimacy in policing, it will give [law enforcement] an opportunity to reach out to the community and for the community to really understand law enforcement,” Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not just us versus them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD endorsed the program at its Aug. 27 meeting, with Board President Spencer Brandt welcoming the attempt at offering alternative punishments for violations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education is always gonna go so much further than a slap-on-the-wrist approach,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [3:26 p.m.]: This article was updated to include further information from Schroeder and Camarena. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

UCSB will have to sneak its way in by earning an at-large berth where the selection committee will decide UCSB’s season based on factors such as the team’s strength of schedule and wins against top opponents.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on the process of playing good baseball,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We got away from that; we looked at the scoreboard standings more than we should have.”</p>\n<p>For teams on the bubble such as the Gauchos, earning an RPI that lands within the top 45 in the nation increases the likelihood of the team qualifying.  As of now, UCSB has an RPI of 57, six spots ahead of where it was last week.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, however, is familiar with late-season pressure. Last year, the Gauchos were in a similar circumstance and needed to sweep their final series to earn a spot in the field. UCSB did just that and found a spot in the postseason for the first time since 2001. Yet, that team finished 17-10 in conference while this year’s squad can best hope for an even Big West mark with a sweep.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need everything to go its way against the Aggies, beginning with starting pitching. In its last two weekend series, Santa Barbara has found success with sophomore Justin Jacome and junior Austin Pettibone on the mound.</p>\n<p>In Jacome’s last two starts he has allowed only two earned runs and increased his innings pitched to 72.1 on the season, the most on the staff. Meanwhile, Pettibone has been even more dominant than Jacome in his last two outings. The ace of the staff has thrown two complete-game shutouts, striking out a combined 15 batters and allowing only nine hits.</p>\n<p>Where the Gauchos have struggled recently is finding a quality third starting pitcher to throw in the third game of the series. On the last two occasions, UCSB has failed to win Sunday games when taking the first two games. Those losses have consisted of the Gauchos struggling to recover from early deficits caused by a lack of quality pitching.</p>\n<p>While the starters will dictate the early-to-mid innings of the game, the bullpen will be just as valuable to secure wins in late-game situations. Sophomore closer Dillon Tate has been UCSB’s go-to pitcher during crunch time. Tate has 11 saves on the season, second in the Big West, and leads the conference with a 0.87 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I just kept working every day,” Tate said. “I was just trying to get better and do something that would benefit me and help my team out.”</p>\n<p>On paper, the Gauchos seem to overwhelm the Aggies on offense, given that UCD has the worst ERA in the league at 4.46. As a staff, Davis has given up the most earned runs and walks in the Big West, with 218 and 211, respectively. With Santa Barbara hitting a collective .286, the team will attempt to get on the board fast.</p>\n<p>First pitch today is scheduled for 2:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

tape around it, warning that the property is uninhabitable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are 12 residents in the house, the two receiving money, UC Santa Barbara

funded $300 each for “food, housing, moving, and storage expenses,” according to a statement sent to the Associated Students Senate by Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) Chair Alex Young. Young is a third-year political science and global studies double major at UCSB.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will come from two places: for Anthony A., as a UCSB student, the $300 will come from the IVTU Crisis Fund, a fund created specifically for crisis events such as the July 12 one on Del Playa, according to Young.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Jonah I. is not a UCSB student, but a recent graduate, the $300 will come from the IVTU Community Fund, an account created at the end of the 2018-19 school year to help provide nonstudents with funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate voted in late July to pass the IVTU’s minutes, giving it permission to disperse the money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Relocation costs can be burdensome, and can make studying, working, or living very difficult without assistance,” IVTU Chair Alex Young said in a message to the senators, asking that they approve the funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our mission is unique in that we are charged with helping all people who live in IV, not just UCSB students, as shown by our support of both a student and a non-student in this incident.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a decade of perfecting his culinary skills, Rogelio Muñoz took an unusual approach to opening a business in Isla Vista; rather than operating a business out of one permanent location, Muñoz opens his stand, known as Roger’s Tacos, at various locations along Del Playa Drive on Wednesdays and Thursdays of each week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muñoz, who is originally from Tlaxcala, Mexico, charges $1.50 for tacos and $6 for quesadillas. For any house that is willing to host his stand, Muñoz offers 50 free tacos in exchange for use of the venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He estimates that he serves around 100 customers each day his stand is open, totaling an approximate 600 tacos in addition to the numerous quesadillas and mulitas. He works the stand along with his nephew and his friend, preferring to maintain a small team in order to ensure quality of the food he serves and to build close relationships with his customers, he told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think food in Isla Vista is expensive. When the food and rent costs so much, the students are unhappy. I believe we are helping students by offering our tacos,” Muñoz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He initially learned how to cook while employed at a food truck in Long Beach called Los Tres Garcias, working as a chef there for two years before moving to a restaurant in Gardena, California, called El Antojito Tacos y Mariscos, where he stayed for another six years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After moving to the Santa Barbara area, Muñoz briefly worked at the Subway in UC Santa Barbara’s Arbor. Muñoz explained that his dream is to eventually relocate his taco stand to the Arbor – as a small indoor eatery or a permanent food stall, much like Die Bretzel or Woodstock’s – in order to better serve the students and connect with more customers. </span></p>\n<p>Photos taken at one of <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muñoz’s set ups on Del Playa Drive can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p></p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-89596-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1336\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89588\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1327\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89585\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=1335%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89583\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1212\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89592\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_11\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89593\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_12\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1315\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89582\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_13.jpg?fit=2000%2C1267\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89594\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_13\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1462\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89589\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/08\\/DP-Tacos_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?fit=2000%2C1170\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"89595\",\"title\":\"DP Tacos_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_14\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Siavash Ghadiri \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
