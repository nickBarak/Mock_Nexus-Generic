The community knows this, the staff knows this, we know this. Last Saturday’s hosting of heavy trap DJ RL Grime was a clear attempt to keep kids off the streets of I.V. during Deltopia; the students responded with immense praise. As the high energy, sold-out crowd and consequently empty Isla Vista can attest, the plan was a huge success.</p>\n<p>Born with the less exciting name of Henry Steinway, RL Grime is an electronic music producer based out of Los Angeles. He blew up online in the early 2010s with his debut EP, Grapes, and his later hit remix of “Mercy” by Kanye West. Since then, he has risen to electronic superstardom amongst the likes of Flume and Major Lazer with his 2014 Void EP and, more specifically, his bass-heavy hits “Core” and “Tell Me.” He more recently was on the world-famous Coachella bill in 2016 as well as the electronic festival, Snowglobe, in Tahoe.</p>\n<p>RL Grime has recently joined the likes of legendary artists such as Snoop Dogg, Diplo and Anderson .Paak to perform at UCSB. It is also worth mentioning that opening act Destructo was also a solid addition to the show and brought a more narrow EDM-favoring crowd in early for some pre-Grime womps.<br>\nSecond-year Ryan Andrews explained, “EDM is a huge part of the culture here. We all love rap and rock as well, but it is really nice to get to come to see some legit festival quality DJs for such a cheap price.”<br>\nBut even for someone outside of the electronic culture, RL Grime provided a high-energy set that was difficult to dismiss for lovers of any genre.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>RL Grime, along with his elaborate assortment of heavy electronic drops, is an extremely talented mixer that wields a unique ability to incorporate other genres into his set. The skill that tends to unite communities is his constant integration of popular hip-hop into his electronic beats, which was made most prevalent with his smash hit remix of “Love Sosa” by Chief Keef. The general approach is to take the already infectious hook of a popular hip-hop song, throw it over a heavier and steady beat and use it as a segue to another electronic drop or melody. Grime has mastered this technique. The genres, which normally seem like polar opposites, were mixed seamlessly in his performance which kept the set flowing well and constantly captivating.</p>\n<p>Among the other songs sampled were throwback “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” by Kanye West, The Weeknd’s broken love ballad of “The Hills” and the new instant classic from Future, the beautiful “Mask Off.” These tunes kept the set dancy and vibrant as well, which can help with the common complaint of an electronic set being too monotonous or artificial. Destructo used the same technique but to a less frequent degree, most memorably with the addition of XXXTentacion’s controversial “Look at Me” amidst his pounding electronic bass.</p>\n<p>As a prominent artist in the UCSB community, RL Grime’s beats caused the audience to respond with vibes that were, for lack of a better term, electrifying, all night long. The student crowd had the same energy as any other typical RL Grime show: plenty of sweaty bodies jumping, moshing, screaming and borderline violently losing their minds to all of the gnarly beats that were dropped. Regarding the performance, Leah Bronstein responded simply yet elegantly: “It was grimey,” she stated, “grimey with a side of filth.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76894\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1628105958\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76893\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76894\" data-attachment-id=\"76894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/rl-grime-by-franciscobarrera-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"RL Grime by FranciscoBarrera 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76894\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Francisco Barrera / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As a music enthusiast and writer, I often feel that it is my given duty to dislike everything that the Electronic Dance Music phenomenon stands for. I’m inclined to believe that it is artificial, without any real message or intelligence and painfully repetitious. The idea of a concert where jumping is the only acceptable form of dancing and drugs are encouraged for enjoyment seems ridiculous to me, and I often find it easy to slouch back into my corner of artistic snobbery with all of the other non-believers. However, there is a lot to be admired here; RL Grime is amazing. The internet EDM hero brought together a ton of different kids with merely a laptop and creativity. He truly is an extremely talented mixer.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, I had way too much fun at this concert. The lights were dazzling, I was moving around like an idiot, I was hooked. The bass hit hard, people were going nuts and it was exactly what you would expect. Mesmerizing seems to be the only word to describe my experience as I was constantly finding myself lost in the sheer euphoria that was presented to me.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/","id":6699,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6698,6697,6696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales","biography":"Not available","articles":[5770,5788,6540,6607,6625,6638,6648,6652,6659,6688,6699,6702,6707,6744,6760,6765,6807],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Friday Review: More Life by Drake","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/df91da4c0c20709e276c25f1bb6ff87f.640x640x1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/df91da4c0c20709e276c25f1bb6ff87f.640x640x1.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1","description":"From rap to R&B to dancehall, he does it all on More Life, and he does it well.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh man.

Yes, some nostalgia-laden Drake reviews touch on valid points, but as with any bias reporting, viewer discretion is advised, at least to some degree.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is within the macro-level arena that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> evaluations can easily garner positive acclaim. Drake has become a master recording artist as both a singer and a rapper; he delivers contagious melodies and captivating flows. His unmatched versatility as a vocalist allows him to successfully execute multiple styles. From rap to R&amp;B to dancehall, he does it all on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and he does it well. There is a track for everyone, which is a major feat in and of itself. Name another rapper who can achieve such wide-ranging appeal … Now cue the crickets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the irresistibility of Drake’s content is largely due to the holistic quality of his compositions. Executive producer and long-time collaborator 40 delivers a signature OVO sound on a handful of the project’s tracks. Boi-1da, T-Minus and Nineteen85 are a few more usual suspects on the production side of the operation. Within today’s popular music climate, an all-star caliber personnel, like the one backing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, provides the closest thing to a satisfaction guarantee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, whether or not you’re a Drake fanatic, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is certainly worth your attention. But there is a right and wrong way to consume this project. Adopt the macro-level scrutinization mindset and you will not be disappointed. Drake has delivered one of the best collections in recent memory and perhaps the most exciting release of 2017.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-07/the-friday-review-more-life-by-drake/","id":6696,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6695,6694,6693],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Homeshake Brings Silky Sounds to Storke","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Homeshake does not boast a sound that is daytime-ready, but nonetheless, the soulful melodies were pleasantly warm.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Monday, the steps descending to the bottom of Storke Tower rapidly filled with denim-covered bottoms and sneaker-clad feet. Passersby stared into the space in front of the tower, wondering why the crowd had gathered — especially since it was prime time for lunch or afternoon classes. The eager group, some of whom had sacrificed both food and learning, was awaiting an afternoon set from Homeshake, the synth-pop project of singer and multi-instrumentalist Peter Sagar.</p>\n<p>Homeshake, currently on tour behind Fresh Air, made a quick stop here in Santa Barbara, presented as part of the noon concert series. This show continues a tradition that is 30 years strong; Program Board’s noon Storke shows started in the early ’80s. The campus population’s music tastes have, of course, changed since then, so the ASPB team tries to account for our wide variety of tastes. Justin Taing, Program Board’s special events assistant, said that his goal is to “get a good mix of local and traveling bands, a combination of my own tastes and people I think would be a good fit.” It is also important for himself and ASPB as a whole to keep in mind the flexibility that the open space of Storke provides in terms of audience accessibility and movement. As anticipation for Homeshake grew, the crowd was visibly pleased, content with Program Board’s appeal to their indie sensibilities.</p>\n<p>Homeshake began in 2013 with the release of The Homeshake Tape. Another cassette followed, and the project was eventually signed to indie label Sinderlyn, which released Homeshake’s debut album In The Shower. Before departing to focus on Homeshake, his misleading moniker for work that is mostly solo, Sagar was a guitarist for Mac DeMarco’s backing band. Echoes of DeMarco’s brand of slacker rock can occasionally be heard in Homeshake’s easygoing sound. In fact, Homeshake and DeMarco are part of a festival-favorite group of Canadian acts, including folk-pop singer Andy Shauf and dream rock band Alvvays.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While setting up the various pedals and effects boxes necessary for his woozy, warm sound, Sagar did not participate in much banter with the audience. He quietly worked on getting everything positioned just right, his thick yellow sweatshirt and khaki-colored pants almost inappropriate for the early April heat. Five minutes past noon, he signaled up to the makeshift soundbooth perched at the top step above Storke, and launched into the instrumental “Hello Welcome,” the opening track from Fresh Air. His bite-sized songs are a good fit for the hour-long slots for Storke shows, creating a set jam packed with tasty sounds.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76892\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2105788950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76891\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76892\" data-attachment-id=\"76892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/homeshake-brings-silky-sounds-to-storke/homeshake/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"homeshake\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homeshake.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Min Xie / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Next on Homeshake’s short setlist was “Call Me Up,” a single that has become one of their most popular tracks. This song belongs on the suggestive playlists of college kids, particularly if they want to impress a girl or guy that’s into cool music. Over catchy, staccato synth notes that replicate the melody of the song, Sagar sings, “Any time you want to just call me up, and I’ll answer you.” His falsetto, manipulated heavily by his ensemble of electronics, melted seamlessly into the day. However, a few songs into the set, he commented that it was “weird playing in the sunlight.” Homeshake does not boast a sound that is daytime-ready, but nonetheless, the soulful melodies were pleasantly warm.</p>\n<p>At the first notes of “Khmlwugh,” a few cheers came from the front of the audience. The track is one of Homeshake’s sexiest and most instantly recognizable. Homeshake’s entire catalog flirts heavily with the sensual, but this song brings it to the forefront with a steady drum beat, unhurried keyboards and Sagar’s voice in its lower register. “Kissing, hugging, making love, waking up, getting high” is what the letters of the song’s unpronounceable title stand for. Homeshake has a charming way of marrying jazz fluidity and R&amp;B chill with soulful grooves. The songs’ warbling instrumentals paired with Sagar’s soft vocals serve as a foil to one another, but these elements are able to create contrast without tension.</p>\n<p>“Making a Fool of You,” from Homeshake’s debut In The Shower, was another familiar track, centered around a jam session bass line. By the middle of the set, a sizable group of people had formed in front of the speakers of the outdoor, makeshift stage, most of them having ditched their Vans to dance barefoot on the pavement.</p>\n<p>Although Sagar and his band moved through the set with little banter, presumably due to obvious time constraints, he did take time to thank everyone who was watching. Peering through his oversized, round, black sunglasses, he commented, “Pretty nice campus, congratulations. I hope you all have an easy time getting out of debt.” His dry sense of humor seems stifled in writing, but his joke was tinged with sincerity.</p>\n<p>Homeshake closed the show with the sunny, midtempo “Home at Last.” As I looked around at the moving bodies, tapping feet and nodding heads, I felt at home: a few weeks into a Santa Barbara spring with the sun shining like it never left in the first place.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

It is difficult to see icons as human beings, and when they die, it sends palpable shockwaves throughout communities of fans and admirers. When ’80s rocker Tom Petty passed away last week, the first person I thought of was my father — his high school days were soundtracked by big radio hits by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, such as “Refugee” and “Don’t Do Me Like That.” Those songs mark a certain form of nostalgia for him, and of course, Petty’s death brought about a certain form of sadness. Tom Petty was one of the best selling artists of all time and was an iconic force in the second generation of classic rock and roll. My father’s reaction to Petty’s death made me think about the icons we have lost recently and how they have affected me personally. His reaction also made me come to this conclusion: It is okay to mourn for an artist whom you have never personally known because you have attached many of your own life moments to their art.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the beginning of Winter Quarter of my freshman year, the news broke that David Bowie had died of cancer. I remember a friend running down the hall and knocking on my door to tell me. I was in the shower, however, and my roommate relayed the news to me after I was finished. Bowie, similar to many of the enigmatic artists of his time, seemed to be someone who would always be around. He was able to float on the periphery of the music world, only descending when he was ready to create something new. But despite his ethereal aura, he was mortal like the rest of us and lost his battle with an awful sickness.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another thing that I’ve learned through the loss of other musical personalities is that the term “icon” is quite subjective. For example, to my father, Tom Petty was an icon, and he was to me, too, by extension. However, to someone who did not grow up with his music, his death does not resonate in the same way. Maybe there’s a sad thought, or a passing condolence, but that is pretty much where it ends. For my roommate, Bowie was just another old, famous singer who died of sickness, but to me, an idol was now gone forever.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The first is obvious: Compile a playlist of your favorite songs by the artist and share it with your friends who also like their music. You can take this even further by diving into their catalogue for B-sides, rarities and covers that you never listened to before. When Canadian singer-songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen, of “Hallelujah” fame, died, I searched for live performances and interviews during which he shared his wonderful, slightly irreverent wisdom. He once said, “Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.” When I read that, I realized that artists are more aware of their mortality than we are as fans. It is human nature to place those you admire on a pedestal, even if that leads you to forget that they, too, are human. Perhaps the most comforting thing of all is this thought: An artist never truly dies, as long as there are people who are enabling their art to live on. And as long as we, the fans and admirers, are here, that will always happen.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.
