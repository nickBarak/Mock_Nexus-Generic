Such pro-peace Palestinians need all the help they can get, because the two Palestinian governments in power today refuse to accept the principle of “two states for two peoples.” In Gaza, Hamas rules with an iron fist and continues to prepare for war against Israel. In the West Bank, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ four-year term expired in 2009, but he has refused to hold new elections. And In both places, Palestinian security forces intimidate and jail dissidents who criticize their leaders.</p>\n<p>We studied the SJP conference program. None of the Palestinian governments’ human rights violations were mentioned. Instead, the program was filled with euphemisms about the importance of destroying Israel, the most progressive state in the Middle East. Is this what it means to stand in solidarity with Palestine?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Elsewhere in the Middle East, oppressed peoples are in great need of support: Women who want to drive in Saudi Arabia, anti-theocratic bloggers in Iran, Christians in Egypt and even Palestinians fleeing the civil war in Syria.

In retrospect, my biggest regret was sitting through a meeting that could possibly be interpreted as the student body legitimizing her appointment as UC President.</p>\n<p>Most disappointing, though, was Janet Napolitano’s outright refusal to host a public forum for all students, choosing to instead meet discreetly with less than one percent of the UCSB student population. As students marched outside on Nov. 21 and 22 with the hopes of catching a glimpse of Janet Napolitano, it became more and more apparent that the voice of the students is not something she takes an interest in.</p>\n<p>Our new UC President began with full control over the conversation and directed us to answer this question: “If you were the UC President and you were in my position, what issues would you prioritize?” This initially seemed like an ideal situation — a system controlled by the very people feeling the repercussions of massive tuition hikes and oppressive policies.</p>\n<p>Yet as the meeting progressed, I became aware that Napolitano was giving no legitimacy to the students’ voices. Napolitano did not sympathize as students attempted to hold her accountable for her policies during her term as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, merely justifying her actions and policies instead of moving forward.</p>\n<p>One student felt compelled to thank her for her “service” to this country — a privilege in itself. While she was building her reputation as Secretary of the DHS through her “service,” others who lived under her policies suffered the traumatic repercussions of countless deportations and unprecedented surveillance. While those who are privileged enough to live comfortably dared to thank Janet Napolitano for her “service,” other students bravely managed to come face-to-face with the human being that was responsible for the deportation of their own family members.</p>\n<p>Hopes for a more affordable, accessible UC system under her leadership were completely shattered by the end of the meeting. Napolitano showcased her disregard for a tuition-free campus in accordance with the UC Master Plan, saying that hope for the “old model” was long gone.</p>\n<p>The Master Plan, a very realistic and “tangible” action plan for the UC system, was drawn up in 1960. The idea of a free, accessible education for all Californians, regardless of race or class, became a force for change in society. However, this revolutionary plan for education — what should be the pinnacle of any democratic society — has been disregarded by UC Regents for decades and, as a result our university has turned into the privatized system we know all too well.</p>\n<p>Indifference towards one of the most profound proposals for free and accessible education is only furthered by our Associated Students’ proposal to “re-envision” a Master Plan that would fix the failures of a broken system. What we have come to know is a UC system that has been increasingly privatized and is far from mirroring the demographics of the state. In fact, acceptance of various marginalized communities has stagnated or dropped at every UC campus in the past two decades.</p>\n<p>Rather than receiving suggestions for a more accessible and equitable education system, Janet Napolitano’s interrogative demeanor pressured students to look for alternatives within their own pools of resources. This was particularly evident when asked about institutionalized retention centers and programs for struggling students of color. Her response, or lack thereof, led me to believe that this meeting was merely intended as a means to publicize her “accessibility” as the new UC President and to justify her crimes and policies of white supremacy under the Department of Homeland Security. Her failure to address the issues that students of color face with honesty is a reminder of her qualifications as a politician and not as an educator.</p>\n<p>Another student brought up the negative effects of the increasing police presence on campus, an ironic remark, considering her extensive coordination with the police at that very meeting. Napolitano attributed the racial profiling and racism in the UCPD to the lack of “police training.” Yet she failed to mention that during her reign over the DHS, she led one of the most aggressive deportation efforts in the United States — a campaign that has made people across this country, and specifically on this campus, feel targeted and unsafe. Secure communities, the “If You See Something, Say Something” campaign and the aggressive border checkpoints are direct examples of her policies that promoted racial profiling.</p>\n<p>It was not only her domestic policies that she justified — Napolitano failed to recognize the coerced compliance in policies of imperialism, violence and colonization abroad, which brings to question her role as a leader in a system intended to be critical of systems she has built her reputation off of. The meeting ended with students expressing personal recollections of feeling physically unsafe on this campus, led by organizations such as Stand With Us and the Anti-Defamation League. Yet Janet Napolitano avoided the question (a common trend during the meeting), referencing instead her preference for “free speech” in these situations.</p>\n<p>I left the meeting feeling further marginalized and angry, but mostly disappointed. Any preconceived notion of higher learning in the UC system was diminished. I came to this campus hoping to be educated on issues plaguing various communities in this country. Instead, I give legitimacy to government practices through Janet Napolitano, I invest in the military and prison industrial complex and I am entangled in two of the largest nuclear weapons facilities in the United States. We hope to leave college with a diploma and decolonized minds, but we sometimes forget the true privilege and responsibility of being a part of such a prestigious university. Janet Napolitano’s appointment is just another way in which the UC system has legitimized white supremacist, racist and imperialist policies. We can no longer be compliant with the institution that is meant to educate and decolonize, which is why the resignation of Janet Napolitano is the only right answer.</p>\n<p><em>Kat A. is a fourth-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

It is a pro US-Israel relations group that aims to promote and strengthen the bond between the United States and Israel. Through our involvement in pro-Israel politics, we interact with key political figures, build strong relationships and ultimately help influence policy-makers both in the present and for the future.</p>\n<p>Along with other members of Gauchos for Israel, I was privileged to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) three-day Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. which hosts 13,000 participants including 2000 students from all fifty states. I returned feeling not only more educated but also truly inspired to act.</p>\n<p>The convention offered a plethora of opportunities to hear distinguished speakers and attend breakout sessions that facilitated panel discussions. I was humbled by words of esteemed political leaders such as Senator John McCain, Israel’s Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Israel’s Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren, Vice President Joe Biden and even Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (via live video satellite). The breakout sessions were informational seminars led by experts in the field covering a variety of issues regarding the relationship between the United States and Middle Eastern nations.

Regardless of Iran’s failing economy, they still remain persistent in their efforts. The United States has realized that this is not only a key problem to the State of Israel, but it also poses a security threat to the U.S. as well. In response, the Obama administration is currently implementing strict sanctions on Iran, most recently a unilateral trade sanction, H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act of 2013.</p>\n<p>Honorable Daniel Glaser, Assistant Secretary for terrorist financing in the United States Department of the Treasury, explained that this would target Iran’s ability to access the international finance system. Any country purchasing oil from Iran must now pay in its own currency, and Iran is no longer allowed to exchange this currency for its own. In addition, sanctions from the U.S. are threatened for any country that deals directly with the Iranian bank. The H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act was passed on February 6, 2013, and will have a huge impact on Iran’s already damaged economy.</p>\n<p>Even though many point to Iran’s evasion of sanctions through loopholes, Glaser reassured that the intelligence office is maintaining a close watch on Iran. Congress is also debating alternative options such as a viable military threat. Once Iran obtains nuclear capabilities, there is no reverting the fact that they could produce an atomic bomb at any given moment.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and Israel must work together to do all that is possible to prevent this precarious situation from confronting the international arena. Having studied abroad in Israel for four months, I feel that this issue not only affects Israeli citizens, but the American general public as well. As an American citizen, I deeply believe in the importance of a strong and united front against a potentially nuclear capable Iran.</p>\n<p>This conference as a whole made me realize how supportive the United States truly is toward its relationship with Israel. Hearing political leaders speak of their reliance on Israel and vice versa was incredibly empowering. I feel proud as an American to be helping to contribute to the safety of not only the citizens of Israel, but the security of the United States as well. I strongly believe that the alliance between the United States and Israel is strong, and will only continue to strengthen in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Ariel Brotman is a third-year psychology and Middle East studies Major.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at <em>dailynexus.com</em> on April 5, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50695\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50695\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/","id":5970,"author":{"id":488,"name":"Abriel Brotman"},"related":[5969,5968,5967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cutting Out the Fat: How Going Meatless Might Save the World","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/carillo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/carillo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kenny Torrella, a Humane Society food policy coordinator, describes the far-reaching effects of eating vegetarian/vegan.

Skipping meat one day a week is not a sacrifice but an adventure. And this is reflected in the choices students are making. According to a study conducted by Technomic, over 20 percent of college students are reducing their meat consumption and for good reasons.</p>\n<p>One of those reasons is concern for the nine billion chickens, pigs and other animals raised for food each year, most of whom suffer in factory farms. For example, mother pigs in the pork industry are typically confined in tiny crates barely larger than their own bodies for virtually their entire lives. Unable to even turn around, these sensitive, intelligent animals — all of whom have their own personalities and preferences — experience tremendous physical and psychological pain. Most egg-laying hens suffer a similar fate, as they’re crammed into tiny cages with each bird granted less space than the screen of an iPad on which to live for her entire life. By choosing meat-free options just one day a week, we can all help prevent an enormous amount of cruelty to animals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Human health and the health of the planet also benefit.

Increasing numbers of family farmers are also voicing their support for Meatless Monday as a means to achieve a more sustainable, community-based agricultural system before it’s too late. By reducing the total number of animals raised for food and looking to local farms for our livestock and produce, we will place greater value on humane, sustainable agriculture in which animal welfare is a priority.</p>\n<p><em>Kenny Torrella is the food policy coordinator for the Humane Society of the United States.
