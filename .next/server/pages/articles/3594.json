Building upon the new legislation and the campus-wide Smoke Free and Tobacco Free Policy of 2014, the UC system is looking to combat tobacco on campuses.</p>\n<p>Following an application process, the UC will select four students, undergraduate or graduate, to receive $12,000 fellowships to fund their research projects regarding the reduction of health effects from campus tobacco use. These students will have one year to complete and present their research and, from there, evaluators will decide if the projects are feasible enough to implement on campus.</p>\n<p>According to Michael Takahara, chair of the UCSB Smoke and Tobacco-Free Steering Committee, the fellowship program was approved by UC President Napolitano at a meeting in February.</p>\n<p>“All of the UC campuses met with President Napolitano on Feb. 1 of this year,” Takahara said. “This was one of the recommendations and she approved it, so we’re very grateful to the Office of the President for doing that.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of the UCSB Smoke and Tobacco-Free Steering Committee Jon Cook said he supports the fellowship program because it will educate students on the negative effects tobacco products have on the campus environment.</p>\n<p>“I will support the program as it works to educate smokers about the impacts of smoking on the campus,” Cook said in an email. “Grounds staff, as well as our PathPoint litter crew spend many hours collecting cigarette butts on campus. We have also had several garbage can fires from cigarettes being discarded improperly.”</p>\n<p>Shanni Tal, undergraduate representative of the steering committee and fourth-year psychology major, said the inclusion of student ideas through the fellowship program will help promote a smoke and tobacco-free campus.</p>\n<p>“We definitely can benefit greatly from more student-lead initiatives,” Tal said in an email. “I think this program will allow students to gain experience in the field of public health and can continue to promote a more holistically healthy environment for our community.”</p>\n<p>“Students are a great voice because students actually see what’s going on,” Takahara said. “It’s great when you have somebody who’s close to this issue being able to address it, because of that proximity … and matching that with a passionate faculty member is just something that’s wonderful.”</p>\n<p>The research possibilities are diverse, Takahara said, and allow for students and faculty members to collaborate on topics they are passionate about while simultaneously benefiting the campus environment.</p>\n<p>“They could have a project that looks at ‘what is the impact of tobacco on our environment and how can we reduce that?’ Or, they could look at ‘How can we design something that’s feasible to be more effective in our enforcement [of the smoke-free policy]’,” Takahara said.</p>\n<p>“Depending on where the student’s interest is, and their faculty member who’s supporting them, they can almost address any of these issues that they’re really passionate about and, hopefully, make a difference that will not only affect our campus, but other campuses as well.”</p>\n<p>Applications for the fellowships are now open, and can be accessed <a

after which they will begin their one-year fellowship in Jan. 2018.</p>\n<p>A press release by the UC Office of the President said the fellowship program is the core of the UC’s recently announced National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>The center aims to explore the issue of free speech on college campuses and American society as a whole.</p>\n<p>Claire Doan, director of media relations for the UC Office of the President, said the center is open to applications from everyone, but that they are specifically looking for established individuals in their respective fields.</p>\n<p>These include policy thinkers, legal scholars, social scientists and journalists who will be expected to use the opportunity to shape the national debate over free speech.</p>\n<p>The application, which is due on Dec. 11, requires a resume, a personal statement of 500 words or fewer and an outline of a research or project proposal, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>As part of their fellowship, fellows will engage with UC students at its Washington Program and spend one week in residence at one of the UC’s 10 campuses, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>Doan added that the UC will provide a $20,000 stipend to each fellow and that fellows do not need to be based in Washington, D.C. However, they must be able to travel to some events held at the National Center and to the UC campus to complete their residency.</p>\n<p>In the press release, UC President and Center Chair Janet Napolitano said the first group of fellows will be at the forefront of “fostering and broadening civil discourse.”</p>\n<p>In order to explore these free speech issues, fellows will conduct research or develop a project to advance the freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>This could take the form of creating a toolkit for campuses, a student app or a published paper, the press release said.</p>\n<p>“For the fellows, this is an opportunity to channel their expertise into advancing knowledge and discourse of the First Amendment and civic engagement,” Doan said.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the center will hold a national conference where the fellows’ year-long projects will be presented.</p>\n<p>The press release said that the purpose of the conference is to develop new approaches for educating students about the First Amendment’s role in American democracy.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79771\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/ucsb-seeks-fellows-for-dialogue-on-free-speech/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79771\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/ucsb-seeks-fellows-for-dialogue-on-free-speech/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/ucsb-seeks-fellows-for-dialogue-on-free-speech/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/ucsb-seeks-fellows-for-dialogue-on-free-speech/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/ucsb-seeks-fellows-for-dialogue-on-free-speech/","id":3591,"author":{"id":208,"name":"Rachael Grand"},"related":[3590,3589,3588],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County Approves Fencing Project","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara County Planning Commission voted unanimously yesterday in support of fencing six public parks that line the bluffs of Isla Vista.

Still others have been badly injured in accidental falls, too many to count.”</p>\n<p>Goodman also said the efforts by Morrison and other student and local organizations to put up fencing in I.V. have been inspiring.<br>\n“Their work reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Margaret Mead,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>“‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.’”</p>\n<p>According to Blough, the construction is vital to maintaining safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Overall, I think building these fences is great,” Blough said. “It doesn’t matter what the cost is, what is important is that these fences will save lives.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print

criticized the University of California in an Assembly oversight hearing Wednesday, with one lawmaker saying he was “pissed” when he saw the state auditor’s claim that the UC had relaxed its standards in admitting nonresident students.</p>\n<p>The state auditor published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AUDIT.pdf\" rel=\"\">report</a> in March that found the UC “has undermined its commitment to resident students” by admitting more nonresidents. According to the study, the university enrolled 82 percent more nonresidents from 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 while decreasing enrollment for resident students by about one percent in that same period.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the audit claims that the UC lowered its standards for nonresidents by admitting thousands of out-of-state students with lower grade-point averages, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores than those of resident students.</p>\n<p>Assembly members called the hearing to examine if the University’s admissions and finance policies disadvantaged California residents applying to the UC in recent years. According to committee chair and District 52 Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, the UC’s policies have failed to put Californians first.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, we are here today with an audit report that confirms what many of us have speculated,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>District 64 Assemblymember Mike Gipson, who requested the audit in 2015, said he was “pissed” by the state auditor’s findings that the UC displaced resident students by increasing the number of non-resident students.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a slap in the face, not only of the members of the legislature, but also of the taxpayers of the state of California,” Gipson said. “The University has just done a very poor job.”</p>\n<p>UC Associate Vice President of Undergraduate Admissions Stephen Handel insisted, however, that the report is “incomplete” and that the University admits every eligible resident student.</p>\n<p>“The University makes an explicit guarantee to every family in California whose son or daughter applies to UC that we will find a place for them if they meet UC’s eligibility requirements,” Handel said. “It is a guarantee that we never extend to nonresidents.”</p>\n<p>UCSB <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/campus.profiles.2015.16.pdf\" rel=\"\">enrolled</a> 6,014 students in 2015, of those, 86 percent were California residents, seven percent were out-of-state and seven percent were international.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" title=\"UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?xTC\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/yhhis0kzk8JIuVxN\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB Nonresident Enrollment Gradually Increased from 2013 to 2015.</a><br>\n <a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>The state audit report specifies UCSB among four other campuses that increased its nonresident target faster than the resident target. Nearly 20 percent of UCSB’s expenditures are funded by the state, and the freshman enrollment targets for the 2015-2016 year aimed for approximately 3,850 California students and 550 nonresidents.</p>\n<p>The different enrollment targets were created to fill each state-funded seat with a California student, according to Lisa Przekop, UCSB Director of Admissions.<br>\n “Non-residents never replace a seat funded by the state,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>The report also includes GPA breakdowns between resident and nonresident students for every school in the UC. UCSB displayed lower average GPAs for nonresident students between 2010-2011 and 2014-2015.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" title=\"UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?cIO\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am/Q08MW6ql9XhDCnQ3\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB showed significant shifts in admitted resident and nonresident GPAs between 2009-10 and 2010-11.</a><br>\n<a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/bar-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=bar_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create bar charts</a></div>\n<p>According to Przekop, the “slight” differences in GPA can be attributed to inconsistencies in the ways different schools calculate GPAs across the world.<br>\nIn the Assembly hearing Wednesday, Handel said the GPA, S.A.T. and A.C.T. scores of the students admitted to the University do not completely qualify an eligible student.</p>\n<p>“Reader evaluations are based on a set of 14 academic factors that look well beyond traditional numeric markers of achievement,” Handel said. “A grade-point average and a test score, important as they are, provide only partial insight into the qualifications of students for college.”</p>\n<p>UC Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom further asserted that the state budget is what controls the enrollment of resident students, not the enrollment of nonresidents.</p>\n<p>“Growth in nonresident students does not constrain the Univeristy’s ability to enroll growing numbers of California resident students,” Brostrom said. “The key to enrollment is state funding.”</p>\n<p>District 16 Assemblymember Catharine Baker told the UC representatives at the meeting that they need to stop discounting the audit report as “unfounded” and start working with the legislators on a solution.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy for all of us to come after you with pitchforks, and trust me, I’ve got one and constituents of mine have one,” Baker said. “Part of the solution is that you are not tone deaf. One of the worst things that can happen with a public servant is they get tone deaf. That’s what we’re hearing.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/assembly-blasts-uc-admissions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/assembly-blasts-uc-admissions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/assembly-blasts-uc-admissions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/assembly-blasts-uc-admissions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/assembly-blasts-uc-admissions/","id":3593,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3592,3591,3590],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
