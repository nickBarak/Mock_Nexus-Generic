The town hall is the third of four scheduled meetings, the next to be held on Feb. 4 at UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall began with an introduction from Regent Gareth Elliott, who explained that the purpose of the special committee is to consider candidates and recommend an individual to succeed President Napolitano.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan Brostrom, UC systemwide executive vice president and chief financial officer, initiated the public forum, urging the special committee to “nominate candidates who are deeply committed to the mission of social mobility in the Central Valley and in California.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brostrom said he hopes that this commitment to social mobility will “not just be in underrepresented communities or in socioeconomic status, but also in geography representing the Central Valley,” as well as assist the </span><a href=\"https://excel.ucmerced.edu/first-generation-stem-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of students at UC Merced (UCM) who are first-generation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with talking about the UC system as a whole, Brostrom focused specifically on the campus of Merced, urging the committee to look at candidates who understand how much UCM still relies on financial aid and administrative support from central UC offices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As many other speakers — comprised of staff and executive members employed at UCM — came to speak before the board, they expressed concerns over the campus’s financial needs and its capability to fund the needed educational growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In recent years, as UCM is on the rise and our students and faculty grow, staff hiring has not kept up,” Priya Lakireddy, president of UCM Staff Assembly, said. “Many of the staff are asked to do more and take on additional responsibilities without resources or compensation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cindi Zimmerman, campus risk manager at UCM, presented a similar financial concern. She discussed the growing pains UCM is experiencing as a young campus, such as “funding constraints [that] create roadblocks for additional full-time employees, which are desperately needed do to the work in order to support the faculty and staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from financial considerations, other UCM speakers encouraged the special committee to select a candidate that mirrors Napolitano’s drive and ambition to continue furthering the academic successes of the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope you will consider President Napolitano’s passion and determination as baseline qualities when choosing candidates to succeed her,” Chris Abrescy, executive director of Alumni Relations, said. “At UCM, we need a president who will understand the Central Valley and its desperate needs for teaching, research and public service that uplifts this economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next President should consider how, in the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/us/university-california-merced-latino-students.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">words of New

However, no UC campus has achieved the goal, and UCSC cites budgetary shortfalls and shifts in the international recycling market as reasons for falling short. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis: UCD is most sustainable university in U.S., third globally, according to GreenMetric Rankings (<em><a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2020/01/24/uc-davis-continues-to-be-a-top-school-for-sustainability/\">The Aggie</a></em>)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis has been deemed the “most sustainable” university in the United States and the third most sustainable in the world for the third year in a row, according to the 10th annual GreenMetric Rankings.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional.”<em> Breana Lepe / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional” or using alternative standardized tests beyond the ACT and the SAT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Standardized Testing Task Force’s (STTF) report comes on the heels of a brewing debate as to whether or not universities should amend their policies to either forgo requiring standardized testing results altogether or to make submitting them optional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, prominent UC administrators, including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive, supported the elimination of standardized testing after they deemed it a barrier for underserved students, the Los Angeles Times </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-23/uc-officials-recommend-dropping-sat-admission-requirement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point in time, the Academic Senate still supports the use of standardized testing, namely because it is unclear how altering the standardized testing policy will affect the admissions process as a whole, systemwide diversity and consistency among applicants, the task force said in its report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC — which receives the largest volume of SAT scores in the nation — were to alter its standardized testing requirements at this time, the report noted that “such a move could have significant, unanticipated, and undesirable effects” on students who plan to apply to a UC school in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the STTF report, the UC currently uses standardized tests for four purposes: to assess academic preparation and achievement, to use as markers for success beyond high school GPA, to establish eligibility and to aid in admitting students at individual campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But standardized testing is only one part of a 14-measure suite of admissions practices used by UC campuses, called a “comprehensive review,” according to the report. The “comprehensive review” encompasses students’ academics and backgrounds to factor in social disparities, the report said.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara and UC Riverside weigh students’ applications based on their standardized test scores before the “comprehensive review” stage. At UCSB, SAT and ACT scores comprise 20 to 25% of a students’ admission score, depending on major, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At all other UC campuses, however, applications enter the “comprehensive review” stage without a weight assigned to their standardized test scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test scores are still weighted less than high school grades, and “admissions decisions are ultimately made based on a review of all the information available in the applicant’s file.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the predictive power of test scores, or how accurately the tests reflect eligibility, has increased in the past decade, the report found, while the predictive power of high school grades has decreased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also said that current standardized testing procedures may be a possible contributor to the underrepresentation of different groups at UC campuses. Almost 60% of California high school graduates are underrepresented minorities (URM), but only 37% of California resident students admitted to a UC school in 2019 were URMs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also acknowledged that the UC’s admissions procedures do not fully compensate for students’ racial and socioeconomic disparities, but found that “for any SAT score, students from disadvantaged groups have a higher probability of being admitted than students from advantaged groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its recommendation to continue using standardized tests, the report also said the UC should steer clear of using the Smarter Balanced Assessment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consortium </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(SBAC) in lieu of the current standardized tests, such as the ACT or SAT. The SBAC, which 11th grade California students take in high school, is aligned to a different set of academic standards and carries risks that are either not present or not as extreme in the ACT or SAT, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The task force was deeply concerned with a wide range of risks related to the adoption of SBAC to meet UC admissions requirements, including (but not limited to) test security, item exposure control, and item bank size,” the report read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report will now move on to the UC’s entire Academic Senate for systemwide input. Then, the Academic Senate will forward its recommendation to UC President Janet Napolitano, who will make a recommendation to the UC Board of Regents to make a final decision in May. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
