To have one of the most gay-friendly campuses in the UC system, with numerous programs dedicated to, and for, the support of the LGBT community and then less than a 20-minute walk away have a community where anti-gay slurs are commonplace. It makes me think of São Paulo in Brazil, glimmering skyscrapers and affluence literally across a highway from slums.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That said, the writer of the letter published on Nov. 5 was foolish for expecting any less out of the peoples of Isla Vista. Now, as someone who would identify himself as a bisexual male, though you wouldn’t know it by looking at me (I don’t wear bright clothing and hate “Jersey Shore”), I can say I never condone homophobia. However it’s simply something you put up with in these circumstances. I am referring, of course, to the Isla Vista party scene.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>The homophobia in the I.V. party scene stems from two sources, the best I can tell. One is the male culture of Isla Vista itself. Perpetuated by MTV and other television shows that depict college life as a drunken orgy, it is commonly believed that alcohol is the medium of exchange. Young girls come to parties to be provided alcohol and in exchange are expected to flirt, dance and in general “hookup” (whatever your definition of the word may be). But this notion also encourages a form of masculinity that revolves around men being the dominant structure in this exchange.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anything perceived as being weak is criticized or attacked by men to assure not only their own dominance, but to put down the weaker individual to separate themselves from that weakness. In this case homosexual men (and women) are perceived as weak because they don’t fit into the accepted cultural exchange of alcohol for human company. Ergo those who identify as or are perceived as homosexuals are berated and ostracized by those who fear being seen as weak themselves. And that is the root of most modern homophobia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second major cause of homophobia is the Greek system. Don’t get me wrong, the Greek system is not homophobic in and of itself (go to any frat party and you’ll see plenty of girls kissing and more), but unfortunately it reinforces the masculine notion of domination.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Again, plenty of members of the Greek system genuinely support gay rights. Despite this however, the Greek system represents the alcohol-for-human-company exchange more than any other organization. Have you been to a frat party? There are more handles and cans of beer than people! And so even if many members of the Greek system truly advocate for gay rights the system itself unintentionally perpetuates a belief that encourages homophobia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It also comes down to their notion of, well, fraternity. A Greek friend of mine once told me that part of being in a frat is brotherhood and that “it would be weird if one brother wanted to sleep with another.” Again, nothing inherently homophobic about it, but that line of reasoning provides the mentality that gays, and for sororities, lesbians, cannot be part of this “sacred bond,” as my friend put it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But this brings me to my main, wonderful, point. Unlike many other campuses, Greek houses don’t have the monopoly on partying. Not only that, but there are many cases of partying specifically tailored to LGBT partygoers. I’ve heard about numerous “gay parties” from my female friends and the costumed and themed parties thrown by various groups, including sports teams and clubs, provide an outlet for the flamboyant in the LGBT community. So there are outlets for those who wish to go party-going and happen to be gay.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Is homophobia wrong? Yes. And I’m in favor of removing hateful speech from legally protected places such as the workspace or schools. But you have no Constitutional right to party, no legal protection against apartment party bouncers and the Supreme Court has yet to rule on quotas for ragers (they’re too busy with racial quotas right now). If someone calls you a hateful name, sue them; that’s your right. If they commit a crime against you because you’re gay, report it; juries eat up hate crimes. But when walking into a party you should have nothing to expect about the treatment you’ll receive if it’s not your party. Get mad all you want but as long as the party culture dominates, I.V. homophobia will always exist. These are my observations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Scott Camus is a third-year economics major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Community Housing Office (CHO) deals with a lot (and I mean A LOT) of roommate conflicts every year, most resulting from people choosing their roommates in haste because of the unnecessary “housing rush” they fall into every Fall and early Winter. Get to know your roommates before signing a legally-binding, joint-and-several lease with people you barely know (or think you know but really don’t). Please take special note of this sentence: Best friends (new or old) often do not make best roommates. Take the time to figure out your rental budget and where in the community you want to live, especially since peer pressure can be very strong when it comes to making important housing decisions. Come to CHO with your potential roommates to pick up our list of roommate questions and ask CHO staff any questions you might have. We will read over your lease, help you figure out if your potential roommates are good matches, and help you brainstorm ways to tell someone you would rather not live with them (ugh!).</p>\n<p>In summary, there are more than enough rentals in Isla Vista, as well as great options in university housing, that you don’t need to rush yourself or agree to live with incompatible roommates for a price you aren’t comfortable with. Looking all through winter and spring quarter is fine, and you may even see prices drop! CHO will be doing a series of programs in mid-January in the residence halls that will address everything you need to know about making the best choice for you. Don’t get caught up in the hype; there are way too many choices to consider before signing on the dotted line!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>What is the legality of hanging out on our IV rooftop? Can our landlords kick us off (or out)?</p>\n<p>Property providers are not trying to ruin your chance to see the Isla Vista sunset from a great spot or sun yourself high in the sky by disallowing you to hang out on the roof. They are protecting you (from falling off) and protecting themselves (from you falling off and suing them and damaging the roof itself). Rooftops are not meant to be used as social gathering places (they can’t handle a lot of foot traffic or weight) so it is appropriate for a landlord or property manager to include in their lease that this is disallowed. Your property provider (or the police!) can certainly give you a warning or two to stop the behavior, as it is a breach of your contract (and dangerous). If the behavior is continued, they could potentially give you a 3-day notice for breach of contract if the violation is substantial enough or charge you for damages caused by you and your lawn chair. Don’t risk your life and limbs or your lease — there are so many other beautiful places meant for gathering and sunbathing in Isla Vista and the surrounding Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How many bugs are too many bugs? Our house has lots of crawlers but we don’t want to go through the hassle of getting it tented unless it’s totally necessary.</p>\n<p>First of all, make sure your house is clean and your stuff is put away since bugs are drawn to trash and leftover smelly food (plus, this is one of your responsibilities in keeping your rental habitable!). Secondly, use bug spray in and around your rental where you see bugs. If you notice an obvious hole or crevice where they are coming in or don’t have a screen covering your windows, submit a written maintenance request to your landlord for repairs. If all your attempts at keeping your rental clean and bug-free fail, submit a note to your landlord requesting they check out the buggy situation. You are entitled, according to California Civil Code section 1941.1, to “clean and sanitary buildings, grounds and appurtenances (for example, a garden or detached garage), free from debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin.” Your property provider may need to send over an exterminator or maintenance person to see where the creepy-crawlies are finding their way in and spray with stronger chemicals. The cleaner your house is when this happens, the better, so that the property manager doesn’t try to hold you responsible. Typically a place won’t get tented unless the situation is really bad or many apartments have bugs and individual extermination treatments aren’t working.

How does that figure compare to university-owned housing or downtown apartment complexes?</p>\n<p>We tell students to expect to spend $600-$700 to share a double room in Isla Vista; however, I’ve heard of students spending as low as $425 and as much as $950 for a double. Rental amounts depend on a number of factors (location, included utilities, laundry, parking, age of building, amenities, property provider, etc.). Prices for university-owned apartments tend to be below market value compared to Isla Vista (from $533-$716) and include all utilities, furnishings and 9-month contracts. Additionally, the security deposit for the university apartments is $150. UCSB Residence Halls are well-priced considering the meals, housekeeping, grounds, convenience, security, programming, utilities, furnishings, 9-month contract and requiring no security deposit. A little known fact: based on UCSB Financial Aid estimated budgets, if you live in the residence halls for your first two years, then in UCSB-owned apartments, you will spend less at the end of your four-year stay than if you were to live in the res halls your first year and I.V. the remaining three years!</p>\n<p>Although the prices of studios ($900-$1,100) and one-bedroom apartments ($1,100-$1,400) don’t vary that much from Isla Vista to Goleta or downtown, it is the two-bedroom places where you notice the biggest difference. Two-bedroom apartments in Isla Vista typically are priced to house four people, so if you consider each person is paying about $650, you find an average price of $2600. Average two-bedrooms in Goleta or downtown are priced anywhere from $1400-$2200, depending on all the extras and whether it is an apartment, duplex or house.

It began to open my eyes to the ideas of racism and white privilege like I had never encountered them before. While racist jokes within the media used to elicit a laugh from me and an afterthought about how funny it is living in a “post-modern” era where racism isn’t as terrible as it used to be, it now reminds me of how often we as Americans overlook the underlying motives of racism that is still thriving within our society. I will not deny that things are, by comparison, better than they used to be; however, that doesn’t deny the fact that, as whites, we do have a huge advantage as we are brought up to look at whites as portraying intelligent, successful and more attractive than other races.</p>\n<p>With this new insight in mind, I will bring us to a house party that I attended a few days before Halloween night. It was a group of my closest gay friends; we all dressed up in different costumes and were having a few drinks at my friend’s house before going out for the gay Halloween party downtown. One of us took out a new game he wanted us to all play together. It was called “Cards Against Humanity.” A spin-off of “Apples to Apples” in which each member places a noun, from his choice of seven cards, that he or she thinks best describes the adjective or predicate card in the center of the group. (Except “Cards Against Humanity” is for an adult friendly group.) As we played, I came across cards entitled “keeping Christ in Christmas,” “Steven Hawking talking dirty,” and “The Jews” which happen to be the very mild cards in the set. Needless to say after cocktails and shots of tequila most of our group was in it to win it, playing each card to make the most hilarious combination to arouse cackles out of the other players.</p>\n<p>It was about this time during the game that a small wave of awkwardness swept over me, giving me butterflies in my stomach. At first this startled me and was quite surprising; I, too, seemed to be having quite a hoot about the whole ordeal. Looking around the room brought me back to the feelings I get while pondering how white rhetoric about racism in our current era makes us feel its ok to make racist jokes and comments openly in our circles. If there had been one African American, Jew or Asian American would this game be any different? Did it matter that all the players were mostly white and didn’t seem to care that we were laughing about subjects that were usually culturally insensitive? It seemed particularly ironic that this was a group of gay men who are all active in gay pride associations sitting around making light of racist slurs and crass remarks, seeing how we ourselves were supposed to be a minority fighting for our own ‘civil rights.’</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It started to make me feel more uncomfortable the more and more I thought about it after that night. Has our sense of humor become so jaded and crass that jokes don’t evoke enjoyment unless there is another group being humiliated? I began to notice comedians these days — Tosh.O off the top of my mind — are more likely to make off-handed comments about extremely offensive things in order to provoke gasps of surprise from the audience, then say something along the lines of “that’s the one where I crossed the line?” in order to bring a following round of hoots and hollers. Does it matter that this makes it that much harder for whites to accept that we continue to use gentrification, stereotypes, and the fallacy of a “post-racist” era to perpetuate our status and privilege today?  Am I one in a minority of thinkers in our generation that seems to think this type of “humor” brings us to become desensitized to racism all together?</p>\n<p>Tonight, I was in a similar scenario with the same group of friends. We gathered, everyone had a beer or a shot of tequila and sat around the room to play “CAH.” Keeping a promise to myself, I said to the group that I was not going to play the game, feeling uncomfortable with the racist elements. These are guys that I have been close to for most of the time that I have spent in Santa Barbara and I value the friendship that we have shared. Even so, they all seemed more caught up in the “novelty” of the game to take me seriously, eventually becoming upset that I would take it so seriously. Comments like “James thinks he is better than us” and “Please, like you really have high morals or something” followed. Feeling uncomfortable as my friends played a game which I had seriously said I didn’t feel comfortable playing, I watched and thought to myself about whether or not I was taking this too seriously. Perhaps I was taking it too seriously. Perhaps, under the reasoning that in laughing at such events they could relieve the power of the fear and “real racism” that such histories had created, my friends thought it was OK to blatantly joke about such past histories as Auschwitz, Rodney King and lynching in the south.</p>\n<p>Either way, I was convinced that it did nothing more than act as a suppressant. As alcohol numbs the emotions, this game seemed to numb us to the seriousness of the realities that these horrors had created. Instead of relieving it of its power, it was, from my perspective, building up an immunity to present and future misconducts of racism. Sickened by the hoots and hollers I stood, grabbed my coat and bid everyone an early goodnight. Perhaps I had overreacted but as I walked out I felt like I was finally doing something that, for the first time in a while, felt right.</p>\n<p><em>James Cobb is a fourth-year global studies major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/choosing-moral-high-road-funny-isnt-funny/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/choosing-moral-high-road-funny-isnt-funny/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/choosing-moral-high-road-funny-isnt-funny/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/choosing-moral-high-road-funny-isnt-funny/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/choosing-moral-high-road-funny-isnt-funny/","id":5992,"author":{"id":497,"name":"James Cobb"},"related":[5991,5990,5989],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Israel’s Right to Self-Defense","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The state of affairs in Israel has escalated and intensified over the past several days.

Since the morning of Nov. 14, more than 275 rockets targeting civilian residents and communities have been fired into Israel by Hamas and its terrorist allies in Gaza. Upwards of 4.5 million Israelis that currently live within Hamas’ rocket range have been forced into bomb shelters. Israel and Syria exchanged fire for the first time in three decades. This is perhaps one of the most precarious situations Israel has confronted since 1948.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 15, the United States Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution recognizing and supporting Israel’s “inherent right to self-defense in the face of terrorist attacks” while emphasizing the fact that “Hamas was founded with the stated goal of destroying the State of Israel.” Led by Senators Kristen Gillibrand and Mark Kirk, 66 senators successfully conveyed the message of their standing in solidarity with Israel while advocating for Israel’s right to defend herself. Co-sponsored by Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Howard Berman, the House passed an almost identical resolution by unanimous consent on Nov. 16. President Obama also held a press conference on the morning of Nov. 18 stating that “there’s no country on earth that would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders … we are fully supportive of Israel’s right to defend itself.”</p>\n<p>Israel’s recently deployed Iron Dome anti-rocket missile system, which the United States has helped fund, has provided some recent protection and minimized damage. It has successfully intercepted at least 100 incoming rockets that were headed toward populous Israeli cities within the first 24 hours of operation. As of Nov. 18, the Iron Dome has intercepted more than 265 rockets. Devoid of vital defensive measures like the Iron Dome, which has provided a significantly magnified level of security, Israeli civilian casualties would likely be far higher in numbers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, since Israel’s 2008 defensive Operation Cast Lead, Hamas has expanded the range and lethality of its rockets by importing advanced Iranian Fajr, Grad rockets and 120mm mortar bombs. In the past four years, Gaza’s rocket factories have also increased its weapons capabilities both in quality and proficiency. Moreover, terrorist organizations within Gaza have gained access to a substantive amount of highly sophisticated anti-tank and surface-to-air shoulder-launched missiles. All of these new advancements pose threats of a new height to the Israeli civilian population.</p>\n<p>The act of self-defense is a right protected and preserved in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Israel’s military operation aims to quell more than 13,000 rocket attacks on Israeli citizens that have taken place since 2001. In accordance with international law, maintaining that a state must strive to minimize the number of casualties in its attempt to achieve military objectives, Israel uses pinpoint targeting to achieve its goals. Hamas, in contrast, regularly uses civilians as shields and protection of military targets. Furthermore, Article 28 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states, “the presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.”</p>\n<p>As stated by Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, “If Palestine were to lay down their guns tomorrow, there would be no war. If Israel were to lay down theirs, there would be no Israel.” The recent attacks validate the deep-rooted need for a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. We, student leaders of the pro-Israel community, support Israel’s fight against terrorism.
