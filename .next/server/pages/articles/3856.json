The resolution, titled “A Resolution of the City Council of the City of Goleta, California Establishing Temporary Resident Only On-Street Parking Restrictions Related to the 2016 Isla Vista Deltopia Event,” will be in place from 9 a.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Although Deltopia is expected to occur the weekend of April 2, City staff requested authorization to implement the parking restrictions for the weekends of April 2 and April 9 to allow for flexibility should the date change.</p>\n<p>Last Deltopia, Goleta implemented a temporary ban on street parking on certain high-traffic blocks of I.V. Based on a survey of residents and testimonies of law enforcement and City personnel following the weekend, City staff concluded temporary parking restrictions are effective and meet residents’ needs.</p>\n<p>Deputy City Clerk Liana Campos presented the City staff’s report recommending City Council pass the resolution.</p>\n<p>The report calls on UCSB to encourage students to park on campus while the restrictions are in place.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is expected to take the same measures for this spring’s event. To help dissuade partygoers from parking in the Goleta neighborhoods closest to Isla Vista during the Deltopia event,” the staff report said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68720\" style=\"width: 810px\"

to change very quickly with the use of social media.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia is not to be confused with a series of sanctioned UCSB events generally known as “Spring Warm Up” that occur in the same time period,” the report said. “Potentially upwards of 25,000 people could pass through Goleta for this Isla Vista event.”</p>\n<p>The parking restriction area would have the boundaries of Cannon Green Drive to the west, Hollister Avenue to the north, Storke Road to the east and Whittier Drive to the south — making up the Goleta neighborhoods known as University 1 and University 2.</p>\n<p>“Parking permits would be required to be taped to the inside of the vehicle’s driver’s side window during the restricted hours,” the report said. “Vehicles found parked on any of the streets in the University 1-2 neighborhoods during the restricted times, not displaying the appropriate parking permit, would be subject to ticketing and/or towing.”</p>\n<p>The recommendation to the City passed unanimously and I.V. residencies will be mailed two parking permits each.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

the second annual Polar Plunge fundraiser at Leadbetter Beach on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With the catch phrase “Freezin’ for a Reason,” the nonprofit encourages participants to come swim in the Pacific Ocean to help fund the organization. Last year, the event raised more than $30,000 for the cause. Everyone is invited to take the plunge in costume or simply make a donation. A minimum donation of $50 is asked of participants taking the plunge, with a free T-shirt and breakfast courtesy of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department included.</p>\n<p>Gina Carbajal, regional director for the Special Olympics of SB, said the fundraiser provided crucial funding for the organization.</p>\n<p>“The polar plunge, and this is our second annual one here in Santa Barbara, is really a way for individuals and groups to actually come together and raise money for Special Olympics,” Carbajal said. “All the money that we raise stays here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>According to Carbajal, the event is very flexible and casual.</p>\n<p>“Individuals get the time to just go and plunge in the water here at Leadbetter Beach, either individually or as groups,” Carbajal said. “You just come out in your shorts, bathing suit — some people come out in costumes.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said there are a different shirts for those who swim and for those who are “too chicken.”</p>\n<p>“The pledgers get a shirt. It’s a full-on shirt that actually has the Polar Plunge and Special Olympics logo on it,” Carbajal said. “It says ‘I took the plunge’ and individuals that don’t want to plunge — are too chicken to plunge — get a shirt that says ‘I was too chicken to plunge.’”</p>\n<p>Carbajal said people should donate because the money raised will stay local, going directly to the Special Olympics chapter for Santa Barbara youth.</p>\n<p>“The moneys that are raised are used for individuals with intellectual disabilities, so individuals that have, for example, Down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy and other types of intellectual disabilities,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Another sponsor of the event is the Hutton Parker Foundation, which funds nonprofit organizations in Santa Barbara County. Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lewis said the foundation has been a long-time supporter of Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>“Benefiting Special Olympics is a very unique and fulfilling event that gives a lot of visibility to the organization and that just helps them to further promote themselves and their programs,” Lewis said. “It’s for a great cause.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/special-olympics-to-host-polar-plunge/","id":3853,"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias"},"related":[3852,3851,3850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Das Williams Introduces Bill To Establish Uniform AP Credit Transfer Among Community Colleges","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?resize=600%2C446&ssl=1","description":"Assemblymember Das Williams recently introduced Assembly Bill 1985, which would establish a uniform policy for Advance Placement (AP) credit transfer from high schools to all California Community Coll...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68411\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68411\" data-attachment-id=\"68411\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/das-williams-introduces-bill-to-establish-uniform-ap-credit-transfer-among-community-colleges/sbcc-campus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?fit=600%2C446&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,446\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBCC Campus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;For Das Williams Article 2-18&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?fit=600%2C446&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68411\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sbcc-Campus.jpg?resize=550%2C409\" alt=\"SBCC Campus.

The goal of the proposal is to make transitioning to a four-year university more feasible for students. The bill would allow for the application of AP credit to college units at community colleges throughout California.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the bill will save low-income students time and money by transferring college credits from AP exams to community college.</p>\n<p>“AB 1985 not only builds a uniform policy to improve students’ time to degree and transfer, ultimately saving tuition costs for students and their families, but it will also prevent discrepancies on AP scores between CCCs,” Williams said in a news release.</p>\n<p>According to Lourdes Jimenez, Williams’ chief of staff, there are currently 24 community colleges that require an AP score of 4 for college credit, six community colleges that require a score of 5 and 10 community colleges that have no policies, out of the 113 California Community Colleges.</p>\n<p>“This inconsistency creates confusion and is an unnecessary barrier to students entering the community colleges in our state who have earned college credit,” Jimenez said. “Assemblymember William believes it’s important to have uniform policies that are clear to students.”</p>\n<p>Jimenez said the office has communicated with administration and officials from the UC, California State University and College Board to maintain the students’ interest when implementing the bill.</p>\n<p>“We have focused on making sure this bill does not affect the work that has already been achieved by the college segments dealing with transferability to make sure a student’s transition in and out of college happens sooner,” Jimenez said.</p>\n<p>Luz Reyes-Martin, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) public information officer, said she supports the bill because there is currently no standardized policy for awarding AP credits across all community colleges.</p>\n<p>“I think what is very positive about the assemblyman’s proposed bill is that it would create a uniform policy across the 113 California Community Colleges,” Reyes-Martin said. “It’s part of our mission to facilitate and support students who want to transfer on to a UC or another four-year university.”</p>\n<p>According to Reyes-Martin, SBCC currently has its own comprehensive AP credit transfer system in which students are awarded general education units for passing an exam with a score of 3 or higher.</p>\n<p>“We have a very good relationship with the assemblymember and his office, so we are definitely looking forward to talking with them and … helping give them any advice or any best practices to offer with that policy,” Reyes-Martin said. “We’ll definitely be looking at the bill and checking it to see how it will affect our existing system.”</p>\n<p>According to Spencer Barr, Santa Barbara High School college and career counselor, close to 50 percent of Santa Barbara High School’s senior class enroll at SBCC for community college.</p>\n<p>“Out of those students, we don’t have a ton of them that are taking multiple AP classes,” Barr said. “It’s usually a couple of classes, maybe as many as four classes that students are trying to get credits for.”</p>\n<p>Barr said although SBCC offers students in Santa Barbara two years of free tuition, he supports the plan to alleviate the financial challenges of all students attending community college.</p>\n<p>“[SBCC] has just introduced a new plan where any local high school student in Santa Barbara, assuming you graduated from a local high school, can go to SBCC completely free for two full years,” Barr said. “That financial hardship is not as much of a financial hardship anymore because everything is paid for.”</p>\n<p>Barr said he supports a uniform AP credit system across all community colleges because it would decrease the time required for students to transfer into a four-year university.</p>\n<p>“It would be great if there is a standardized platform for the California Community Colleges in terms of accepting credits,” Barr said. “That would speed up the transfer process for any students who are looking to go that road with two years at community college and transferring to a four-year university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-68844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Professional photographer and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Sebastião Salgado and author Pico Iyer spoke Wednesday evening at the Arlington Theatre about Genesis (2013), Salgado’s most recent photographic project, along with a discussion on environmental issues.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s photographic endeavors have taken him to over 100 countries and are documented in books such as Other Americas (1986), Migrations and Portraits (2000) and Africa (2007). At Wednesday’s event, Salgado presented photographs from Genesis that depicted vast landscapes, exotic animals and indigenous communities in the Galápagos Islands, Amazon jungle and West Papua, among other locations. Images for the Genesis project were captured over a period of eight years.</p>\n<p>Ph.D. candidate in computer science Arlei Lopes Da Silva said Salgado’s commentary on his travels complimented his photographs to communicate his message of environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>“I think, like he said, there is a social aspect and a political aspect to his work; he has a lot of ideology in him … he is not only taking photographs,” Silva said. “He has this political commentary that comes with the pictures, which I think is particularly interesting.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said during Genesis’ creation, he learned mutual respect should exist not only between humans, but also between all things on earth.</p>\n<p>“Each species is truly rational,” Salgado said. “Through this project, I started to respect other species: animal, vegetable, mineral.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said he started the Genesis project at the Galápagos Islands because of its wildlife.</p>\n<p>“I started Genesis in Galápagos because I had a wish to discover the animals,” Salgado said. “The evolution is so incredible.”</p>\n<p>Third-year zoology major Erin Morgan said she admires Salgado’s regard for nature and his awareness of the challenges facing the environment.</p>\n<p>“One thing that really got my attention was that Salgado talked about going to ‘meet the trees,’ which I thought shows that extra level of respect and recognition for nature and makes you realize that you are part of something that’s so much bigger than just being human,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Salgado said his work explores the ideas of shared responsibility in caring for the planet.</p>\n<p>“We have the tools to protect the planet … we are responsible for everything in our society,” Salgado said. “We destroy our forests, we destroy everything, we don’t care about our planet; we need to respect every life.”</p>\n<p>Ph.D. candidate in computer science Sourav Medya said Salgado’s willingness to express his personal opinions is commendable and visible in his work.</p>\n<p>“He cares a lot about the planet, so whatever he shows in his photography is something intuitive based on this idea,” Medya said.</p>\n<p>Salgado described his ability to visit the globe’s most isolated locations as his “biggest gift” because he “became” the nature he experienced.</p>\n<p>“In this moment, I became a stone, I became the snow, I became the mountain … I was the planet,” Salgado said. “I made a lot of trips, but the biggest was inside myself.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Yana Williams said she appreciated Salgado’s idea that people must accept responsibility for the unintended consequences their actions have on the planet.</p>\n<p>“I was really inspired when Salgado talked about how people like to point fingers when they’re talking about environmental issues,” Williams said. “We’re all involved in these issues … they affect us, just like they affect the people living in the places that are being torn down. We should all take an active part in this effort.”</p>\n<p>Salgado concluded his talk by saying photography should be used to call attention to issues facing society.</p>\n<p>“Photograph is a mirror of our society, a tool, a language,” Salgado said. “We have the tools to take care of the planet for the future, but to do this, we have to take care of the past.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68842\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/renowned-photographer-speaks-in-santa-barbara-about-new-project-environment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68842\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/renowned-photographer-speaks-in-santa-barbara-about-new-project-environment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/renowned-photographer-speaks-in-santa-barbara-about-new-project-environment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/renowned-photographer-speaks-in-santa-barbara-about-new-project-environment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/renowned-photographer-speaks-in-santa-barbara-about-new-project-environment/","id":3855,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[3854,3853,3852],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
