It will continue throughout Saturday with sessions focusing on community engagement to share unique perspectives and celebrate what makes Isla Vista great. The event is free and open to everyone with breakfast and lunch provided on Saturday.</p>\n<p><strong>CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE</strong><br>\nThe Student Activist Network is hosting civil disobedience training 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday at 777 Camino Pescadero.

Want free brunch? Look no further; Isla Vista Food Cooperative will be hosting their month Beach Brunch Yoga this Sunday from 9:45 a.m. to 12 p.m. Those who decide to attend must R.S.V.P. on Facebook so organizers know how much food to provide.

Nesovic singled for what would be the scoring run as he was subbed out for a pinch runner.</p>\n<p>A USC throwing error on a bunt put two Gaucho runners on the base path at first and second. Another sacrifice bunt laid down by senior catcher Campbell Wear advanced runners to second and third. An intentional walk on senior third baseman Peter Maris then loaded the bases.</p>\n<p>A Gaucho strike-out put two outs on the scoreboard as junior first baseman Dalton Kelly took the batters box as a pinch hitter to score the runner on third in a walk-off RBI.</p>\n<p>“It helped us out that they didn’t play catch and get that out,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “Campbell was able to get that bunt down the second time, and it was really Dalton and Fredrick coming off the bench for the pinch hits. Billy’s nickname is ‘Big Time Billy,’ because last year he earned that nickname from his clutch performances off the bench.”</p>\n<p>Nesovic went 3 for 4 in yesterday’s game, and accounted for two of the three Gaucho runs – his pinch runner accounting for the third. Sophomore infielder Billy Fredrick stepped up to pinch hit and bat in the tying run in the bottom of the seventh off a single to right center.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been seeing the ball well and my teammates have been putting me in good positions and getting on base a lot too,” Nesovic said.</p>\n<p>On the mound, UCSB’s junior left-handed pitcher Domenic Mazza pitched for 7.2 innings in his longest start of the season so far. He held the Trojans to only two runs in five hits and threw nine strikeouts advancing to a 1.56 earned run average.</p>\n<p>“This was a good bounce back effort for [Mazza]. He did a nice job of establishing strike one, and getting ahead of the count,” Checketts said. “He did well after giving up that first inning run, and shutting it down for the rest.”</p>\n<p>Mazza turned over the ball to junior righty reliever James Carter in the eighth for his first win of the season. Carter threw 18 pitches in his 1.1 inning appearance allowing one hit and recording two strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to pound Campbell’s glove,” Mazza said. “He called the game today instead of Checketts. He had done that with me all summer and we have a good connection when I’m out there.”</p>\n<p>Four pitchers made an appearance for the Trojans on the other hand. The starter, junior Tyler Gilbert, pitched through six, striking out 11 and allowing one run in three hits. Junior Marc Huberman was recorded as the losing pitcher.</p>\n<p>After yesterday’s game, the Gauchos are scheduled to play the next two weekends on the road, the first against Sacramento and the second against Wichita State.

New fraternities are now dealing with the repercussions. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The last three closures paint an unfavorable portrait of Greek life at UCSB, but three new fraternities have sprouted up in Isla Vista with an emphasis on preventing sexual harassment, hazing and alcohol hospitalizations.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma attained charter status in Spring 2015, as did Sigma Chi in Jan. 2017. Phi Delta Theta received colony status in 2016.</p>\n<p>According to the three fraternities’ presidents, none have violated policies from the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), Office of Student Life (OSL) or their national headquarters.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi president and third-year environmental science major Ryan Kelly said his organization has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault and hazing.</p>\n<p>“As sexual assault and stuff like that is very prominent today, you hear a lot about that, not only in general, but with Greek communities,” Kelly said. “So that’s something we definitely were aware of and wanted to change specifically at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Kelly said his organization will kick brothers out of parties if the women attending feel uncomfortable in any way.</p>\n<p>“What it comes down to is how the girl sees it. If she feels uncomfortable; if she thinks something is happening … We really ultimately have to trust the girl’s word, because we don’t want that to be perceived as us making this acceptable,” Kelly said.</p>\n<p>Kelly said there would be consequences for brothers if this occurred, beginning with being removed from a party. In extreme circumstances, the brother could be removed from the fraternity and sent to the university to face additional punishment.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma president Adam Elomari and Phi Delta Theta president Christian Munson said their organizations have similar policies and do not tolerate sexual harassment or hazing in any way.</p>\n<p>Though several fraternities have aimed to improve safety policies, the Office of Student Life has issued IFC three warnings, three probations, one suspension and one closure for violation of OSL policies since 2015, according to an email from Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the OSL.</p>\n<p>These numbers do not include informal conversations about fraternities’ behavior between OSL and the fraternities’ officers.</p>\n<p>Ashlock also said in the email multiple organizations have been charged with hazing since 2015, including campus organizations, fraternities, sororities and athletic teams. More than one organization is currently under investigation for hazing, he said in the email.</p>\n<p>According to the associate dean, the university’s current policies on hazing have changed but their central meaning has not.</p>\n<p>“Hazing simply should not be tolerated in any organization,” Ashlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Hazing is defined by OSL as any method of initiation likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm or “personal degradation or disgrace” that may lead to physical or mental harm.</p>\n<p>Hazing is currently considered a policy violation even if it does not actually cause harm. Any behavior that is likely to cause harm can qualify as hazing.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said his office is currently working with officers of several organizations to inform them of university policies.</p>\n<p>OSL currently requires fraternities to attend five workshops every year educating them on multiple subjects ranging from sexual violence, hazing, drug use, mental health and diversity awareness.</p>\n<p>Kelly said he has found these workshops useful, and his fraternity’s members gather to see how they can apply the workshops to their organization after they attend the meetings.</p>\n<p>Munson said the workshops do a good job of discussing the subjects, but he would prefer if they wore more interactive.</p>\n<p>“Maybe make it more interactive in a way so there’s not as many people who are not paying attention,” Munson said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May 11, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/unfazed-by-the-haze-greek-life-confronts-its-reputation/","id":4403,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4402,4401,4400],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVRPD Accepts $13,000 Donation from UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Special-Tax-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Special-Tax-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District accepted $13,000 from UC Santa Barbara this Thursday as part of an agreement to use the funds for park improvements and maintenance.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) accepted $13,000 from UC Santa Barbara this Thursday as part of an agreement to use the funds for park improvements and maintenance.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD voted 4-0, with Director Charles Lopez absent, in favor of a resolution to accept the funds on Thursday.
