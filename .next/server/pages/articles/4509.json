Organizers are also planning to host a “brainstorming session” next week about the community center which will take place the first weekend of October.</p>\n<p>There will be another meeting at 6 p.m. tonight in the I.V. Clinic building to discuss a proposed noise ordinance change for Isla Vista. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office proposed in August that the start of quiet hours be moved earlier from midnight to 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. At the meeting, students and Isla Vista residents will be able to voice concerns to officers regarding matters such as enforcement of the ordinance.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its annual Pardall Carnival on Saturday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. The carnival will feature tables from many of the student groups and local organizations involved on campus and in Isla Vista. IVCRC will have a Ferris wheel on Pardall Road as well as live music from local bands. The Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank will provide free food for attendees.</p>\n<p>A local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Cafe). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Division of Student Affairs will be hosting an evening of spoken word by artist Sunni Patterson on Tuesday, Oct. 4, at the St. George Family Youth Center (889 Camino Del Sur). The performance is part of the “Resilient Love” series that “asks how we can respond ethically and honorably to hate and violence.”</p>\n<p>Sunni Patterson will perform for another evening of spoken word on Wednesday, Oct. 5, alongside David Kyuman Kim and George Lipsitz at the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall. This event is again part of the “Resilient Love” series.</p>\n<p>Community volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters, registering as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record of 13,000 registered voters for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday, Oct.13, at the I.V. Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p>The Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Vive El Arte SB is hosting a “Free Concert for the Family” at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, at Isla Vista Elementary School (6875 El Colegio Rd.).

Saint Mary’s has now lost five games in a row falling to 4-8.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now in fourth place in the Big West conference at 7-4 thanks to a solid start from freshman starting pitcher Kenny Chapman. Chapman pitched six strong innings for his second win of the year, allowing just three hits and just one run coming in the first inning.</p>\n<p>“Early on I felt kind of off, just a little bit,” Chapman said. “I had a tough time getting the first pitch strike over but after that first inning I found myself a little bit and was getting that first pitch strike over and felt that after that my change up was working for me better and had real great defense behind me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gaels jumped out to a lead in the first inning on an RBI single by sophomore Collin Ferguson. Chapman had walked the leadoff hitter who then stole second to move into scoring position. Ferguson sent a 0-2 pitch into right field to put his team on the board first.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tied the game in the bottom of the second inning after getting their own leadoff hitter aboard. Sophomore right fielder Luke Swenson singled to shortstop and advanced to second base on a wild pitch. Freshman center fielder Andrew Calica then doubled in Swenson to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Kelsey Outram had gotten through four innings relatively unscathed for the Gaels but was hurt by allowing the leadoff man aboard. In the bottom of the fifth inning, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon singled to start the inning followed by sophomore Tyler Kuresa. The two then advanced on a sacrifice bunt and came around to score on Swenson’s two-run double. Swenson would come around to score on a squeeze by freshman second baseman Ryan Clark for the three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put another three-spot on Saint Mary’s when yet again the leadoff batter reached base. With the bases loaded and one out, Kuresa crushed a double to right center field to clear the bases and put the Gauchos up 7-1.</p>\n<p>“It was a great day today. Everyone was on,” Trinkwon said. “We got 12 hits, probably should have had even more; I know I let a couple opportunities slip away, I know some other guys did too but we are satisfied with the win.”</p>\n<p>Chapman led the top of the seventh off with a walk and was pulled in favor of freshman Domenic Mazza, who recorded three quick outs to keep the Gaels off the board in the seventh. Fellow relievers, freshman Connor Baits and senior Jared Wilson, followed suit with quick eighth and ninth innings to seal the victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a good bounce back for [Chapman and Mazza]. They came in throwing strikes. [Chapman] did a nice job, but … we have seen better so I think there is still one more gear for him to get into,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “And that was the Dom we know and love and the guy we thought we had.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara next faces the University of Texas this weekend.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 5th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50469\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50469\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/gauchos-win-fourth-straight-in-rout/","id":4506,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4505,4504,4503],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings On In Isla Vista This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=740%2C325&ssl=1","description":"Upcoming events include Pardall Carnival and a community meeting to discuss the proposed 10 p.m. noise ordinance","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2 align=\"CENTER\">Upcoming events include Pardall Carnival and a community meeting to discuss the proposed 10 p.m. noise ordinance</h2>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center tomorrow has been cancelled due to a lack of community response.

Starting at 10 p.m., members of the church will be grilling and handing out 240 free hamburgers to partygoers. The meat for the burgers this year are the result of a donation by Goleta-based South Coast Church in partnership with Shalhoob Meat Company. According to Jason Lomelino, the pastor of IVC, the 2016-2017 school year marks the 15th year of the ministry.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday,

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Josh Ortiz, County news Editor</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Log onto Facebook and you will probably see a newsfeed full of articles or videos on Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. We hear the constant drum of “Trump is a short-fingered xenophobe with an odd fixation on Skittles” or “Hillary is a lying crook but is actually dead and the woman behind the podium is actually a body double.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Believe me, I know the allure of this realm of election coverage; it can come off as ridiculous or groundbreaking or just straight-up entertaining. I am 98 percent sure that I’ve read at least one Trump-esque news article every day since the billionaire first announced his candidacy over a year ago.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Just for a moment, however, let’s take our eyes off the national election coverage and take a look at the election going on right here in our own backyard, an election that can most certainly affect our lives in a direct way.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Take, for example, the historic ballot measure to raise up a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista this November. The I.V. CSD is a proposed form of local governance that will have the power to improve infrastructure and institute community policing should Measures E and F be approved by voters.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sure, a CSD has little to do with peace in the Middle East or ending Congressional gridlock. The question of approving the I.V. CSD, however, does affect whether students will be able to walk home on a well-lit street. At the same time, having a CSD also determines how much more money in taxes students pay on a monthly basis (as much as “half a Freebirds burrito every month,” according to community organizer Jonathan Abboud).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Indeed, this local election really does have its own sense of thrill; it’s the consummation of nearly two years of reporting in I.V. on my end. In this other realm of election coverage we also see the work of an influential local political party — the Santa Barbara County Democrats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">See, for example, the I.V. CSD board of director’s race. Just a few weeks ago, the local Democratic Party handed its endorsements to four candidates running for elected office in the proposed I.V. CSD — Spencer Brandt, Natalie Jordan, Ethan Bertrand and Father Jon-Stephen Hedges.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Prior to this endorsement, many of the candidates expressed the influence it would have in determining the outcome of the November election. The Democratic Party provides candidates with access to an unprecedented amount of resources: mail-in flyers, volunteer forces and cooperation with the campaigns of other local candidates and measures.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One other candidate, Andrew Gabriel Pragin, even said it would be a significant setback to not receive such an endorsement. He sought the endorsement, but was passed up by the local party officials. Now he fights what he called an “uphill battle” to get a foothold in this election, the struggle to receive the endorsement of other local political entities without the approval of the Democratic Party behind him.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Look also at the race to elect the Third District County Supervisor. The two candidates vying for the position this November are Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann. The two are far from being a Hillary-Trump dichotomy, but their competition for the seat is a determining factor in Isla Vista affairs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Without a CSD, the Santa Barbara County is the only governing entity (other than the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District) responsible for the college town, and the Third District County Supervisor serves as the sole representative of Isla Vista on the county board of supervisors.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That being said, the Third District County Supervisor will be a large voice in the things that affect students in Isla Vista, such as the amount of policing in Isla Vista during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This upcoming school year, I encourage you to follow the local election cycle. This is the election where we can see history unfold in Isla Vista and see the face of representation change in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My personal recommendation: check in with the <i>Nexus</i> on all your local election coverage as often as you check in with Facebook on all things Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/","id":4508,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4507,4506,4505],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
