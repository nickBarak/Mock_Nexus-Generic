Seniors Guard Michael Bryson and forward John Green led the way for UCSB, scoring 11 of the team’s first 15 points to help set the Gauchos up with a 15-6 lead prompting them to never trail at any point of Thursday’s contest.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored the first six points for UCSB, including a layup just 18 seconds into the game. Green came off the bench in attack mode, hitting a mid-range jumper and three-pointer all within the 11<sup>th</sup> minute of the first half. The two went 7-11 from the floor in the first half, playing a major role in UCSB’s 29-18 advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior guard T.J. Taylor also added the exclamation point with seven seconds left in the first. Off a UCR turnover, Taylor went coast-to-coast maneuvering past a defender and hit a buzzer-beating three with one second to spare.</p>\n<p>Taylor tied season-highs with eight points and four assists in nineteen minutes off the bench.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders had their troubles in the first half, shooting 7-28 from the field, guards Gentrey Thomas and Jaylen Bland helped turn things around. Riverside chipped at its 11-point deficit as Thomas connected on a three-point shot followed by a strong finish to the rim. This five-point swing helped pull the score to 32-30 with 16:40 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Helping bring UCR within the Gauchos’ lead was the Highlanders’ senior captain in Bland. With 6:40 left in regulation, Bland knocked down his 100<sup>th</sup> three-pointer of the season, a Big West best, to trim UCSB’s lead to 50-44 with 6:40 to go.</p>\n<p>While Bland entered Thursday with the fourth-best scoring average in the Big West of 16.5 points per game, the Murray State transfer did not have the most efficient shooting night from the floor, going 4-15 overall and 3-11 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Bland has had a rocky scoring stretch during his past three games, averaging 8.3 points per game including a 1-8 shooting night and season-low five points against Cal Poly on Feb. 13.</p>\n<p>With the Highlanders quickly on its heels, Santa Barbara converted at the free-throw line going 11-12 in the final six minutes to secure its victory. Overall, UCSB went 18-25 from behind the free-throw line, including the reliable foul shooting of senior forward Sam Beeler, who hit four of his six made free-throws in the last five minutes of play.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Johns, the Highlanders relied heavily on junior forward Secean Johnson to keep UCR within reach. After losing his starting spot last Saturday to sophomore forward Alex Larsson, the Juco transfer had a monster game playing all but five minutes Thursday night as he led Riverside in scoring with 21 points.</p>\n<p>Johnson recorded his second double-double of the season, grabbing 10 rebounds in the match—five offensive and five defensive. His versatility on the court resulted in him recording two assists, one block, and a pair of steals as well. However, Johnson’s performance was not enough to stall UCSB from earning its 65-55 win.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Gauchos collecting their sixth conference victory of the season, Head Coach Bob Williams joined Pacific’s Bob Thomason and UNLV’s Jerry Tarkanian as the only coaches in Big West history to ever achieve 300 wins.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to defend home court in a rematch versus UC Davis tomorrow, Feb. 20 as tip-off will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/","id":346,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[345,344,343],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"As Big West Tourney Nears, UCSB Looking for Wins Against CSUN and LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Beginning the UCSB women's basketball team's three-game home stretch is its matchups versus Cal State Northridge tonight and Long Beach on Saturday.

After splitting their pair of games last week with an 80-62 win over UCI and a 60-52 loss to Long Beach State, the Gauchos prepare for rematches versus Cal State Northridge tonight and LBSU on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Chasing UCSB are the Matadors in sixth-place at 6-18, 4-6 in the Big West. They were defeated by UCSB 65-49 in the first meeting between the two teams two weeks ago. The 49ers managed to redeem their first road loss of the conference season at Hawaii, which ended their five-game winning streak, with their victory over UCSB last weekend. LBSU ranks fourth in the Big West with an 18-6 overall and 7-3 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a 2-12 start in its non-conference schedule, it seemed like the reigning conference tournament champions were destined for a first-round exit in the postseason. Although the Matadors remain below the .500 mark in Big West play, they could be the ‘cinderella’ story of this year’s tournament in March.</p>\n<p>Central to CSUN’s improvements in the second half of the season has been the emergence of freshman center Channon Fluker. After starting in just one game during the non-conference portion of the season averaging 6.6 points per game and 6.5 rebounds per game, Fluker has been one of the most dominant post players since the start of the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Recently, Fluker has recorded seven consecutive double-doubles and is averaging 20.8 points and 13.9 rebounds per game. Through 10 Big West games, she has led CSUN with 16.7 ppg and 12.4 rebounds per game. Both conference averages lead the Big West thus far.</p>\n<p>She didn’t start in the Matadors’ first meeting against the Gauchos, and finished with eight points on 3-8 shooting and a game-high 15 rebounds in 26 minutes of play. While the addition of Fluker to the team’s starting lineup may make a difference, the Matadors hope to avoid another inefficient shooting night. Overall, CSUN shot 19-53 (35.8 percent) and 3-13 (23.1 percent) from beyond the arc in the Feb. 3 meeting.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, it was a phenomenal shooting night for the Gauchos, posting their third best three-point shooting performance of the season at 42.9 percent. Nonetheless, Santa Barbara notched a 45.8 field goal percentage to complement its long-range shooting.</p>\n<p>Contributing to the Gauchos’ fluent shooting from behind the perimeter and from other areas of the court was senior guard Jasmine Ware. Although she attempted just one shot from deep, she registered a game-high 17 points on an 8-11 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will attempt to recover its tremendous three-point shooting after an 18.2 field goal percentage from beyond the arc last Saturday at LBSU. However, ensuring that it contains Fluker will be the Gauchos’ main priority entering tonight.</p>\n<p>Continuing UCSB’s home stand is its rematch versus Long Beach State Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will seek to rally back from its worst shooting night from the field (28.8 percent) and from behind the three-point line (18.2 percent) in a conference game this season in its loss to the 49ers. Once again, UCSB will have to endure Long Beach State’s stout defense which leads the Big West and ranks 13<sup>th</sup> in the nation with 21.3 turnovers forced per game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB forced 21 turnovers last Saturday, it allowed Long Beach State to capitalize on points off turnovers at a greater pace of 25-17 in which the Gauchos turned the ball over 18 times. After netting a career-high 20 points, four assists and four steals in the team’s win over UCI, junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe was responsible for six of UCSB’s 18 turnovers against LBSU.</p>\n<p>Benefitting from the 49ers’ advantage in points off turnovers were junior forward Madison Montgomery and junior guard Raven Benton. Both finished with 15 points and were precise with their shot selection. Montgomery shot 7-11 from the field, while Benton went 5-6 to go along with three steals.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to possibly defeat LBSU, not only will it need to reduce its amount of turnovers, but it will need more production from its bench. The Gauchos were outscored 24-13 in bench points while Roper was the only player on the team to notch double-figures in scoring with 16 points on a rough 4-14 shooting afternoon. Despite 21 minutes from Ware and 26 minutes from senior guard Dioseline Lopez, the two combined for 11 points on 4-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB managed to tie the game at a score of 48-48 in the fourth quarter, it lacked a consistent source of offense to secure a victory.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game versus CSUN will begin at 7 p.m. The Gauchos will welcome Long Beach State to the Thunderdome on Saturday, Feb. 20 and face the 49ers at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/","id":343,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[342,341,340],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Extend Streak Against UCR, Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team is fourth in the Big West standings with a 5-5 conference record and is could reach the .500 mark overall with a win over UCR tonight.

Aside from the 29 combined points that sophomore guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Michael Bryson tallied home, Bob Williams accredits this victory to a collective team effort from other players on his squad.</p>\n<p>“It’s crucial when other guys make contributions offensively for us [because] it turns us into a much more efficient team,” Williams said. “John Green was alive … Sam Beeler was really effective [on the floor], and Eric Childress continues to be money shooting the ball from the three-point line. This gives us a lot of balance because opponents are going to pay a lot of attention to Michael and Gabe.”</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos shot a season-high 23-26 from the free-throw line last Thursday.</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB will have to contain the senior duo of forward Taylor Johns and guard Jaylen Bland. The two are the best frontcourt-backcourt combo in the conference, combining for 32 points per game, Bland at 16.5 and Johns at 15.5.</p>\n<p>Johns carried the Highlanders in their 78-86 loss to Cal Poly last week. The senior scored a game-high 25 points in 38 minutes, also tallying his fifth double-double of the season with 10 boards.</p>\n<p>While Bland only scored five points in his last match, he and Johns have scored 20-plus or more points in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>Looking to avenge their six-point loss last Thursday and upset UCSB at home, junior guard and Darius Graham and senior forward Josh Fox will play pivotal roles Saturday night against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Graham is coming off a big game against the Gauchos scoring a game-high 19 points while going 3-4 from downtown. The 5-10” floor general has shown signs of being an offensive threat, leading Davis in scoring five times this season including a 21-point outing in its 58-55 win against Riverside.</p>\n<p>Big man Josh Fox will try and compliment Graham’s guard play down low in the post. Last year’s Big West Sixth Man of the Year, the forward has been having an unforgettable senior campaign leading all Aggies in scoring with 14.2 per game and field goal percentage with 51.5 percent. Fox has led his team in scoring 10 times this season while scoring 17 or more points in ten occasions.</p>\n<p>With regard to last Thursday at UC Davis, a conference win was not the only achievement Coach Williams accomplished against his former team. Coaching the Aggies from 1990-1998, the three-time Big West Coach of the Year collected his 299th win last Thursday.</p>\n<p>While this milestone is a notable one, just one victory shy of being the 3rd coach ever in conference to eclipse the 300-win mark, Williams says at this point it is just a number.</p>\n<p>“The win at Davis meant a lot to me because it was home for eight years … but I’m just not attached to the number of accumulated wins at this stage in my life,” Williams stated. “Maybe 10 years from now when I’m reading through a scrapbook that will be something that means something to me.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face UCR tonight at 8 p.m. UCSB returns to action in the Thunderdome this Saturday, Feb. 20 versus UC Davis, which is set for a 7 p.m. tip-off time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/","id":344,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[343,342,341],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Overcomes Sluggish First Quarter, Emerges for 70-58 Win Over CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 24-6 run in the second quarter of Thursday's game versus Cal State Northridge helped guide the UCSB women's basketball team to its 70-58 victory over the Matadors Thursday night.

Northridge fell to 6-19 overall, 4-7 in conference play.</p>\n<p>After scoring its first field goal at the 9:30 mark of the game, UCSB was unable to score its next basket until 3:40 remained in the first quarter. While UCSB struggled shooting the ball, CSUN managed to go on a 15-2 run. Helping establish this run was Fluker with nine points in the first quarter as CSUN ended the first period with a 20-6 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being held to just six points in the first quarter, UCSB answered with some lockdown defense of its own, holding CSUN to just six points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>“We put good pressure on the guards on the perimeter and made things uncomfortable,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Our double was good. We turned [Fluker] over three times, got a travel. Just to be disruptive always creates some offense from defense.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara forced 24 turnovers, recorded 14 steals, and outscored CSUN in points off turnovers 30-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ stout defense helped to resolve their cold shooting start to begin the game as they went on a 7-0 run to open the second period which brought them within a single-figure deficit of 13-20. As UCSB’s scoring run expanded, it ended the second quarter outscoring CSUN 24-6. Prompting UCSB’s scoring stretch was its improvement from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>After going scoreless from beyond the arc in the first 10 minutes of Thursday’s game, Santa Barbara sunk four of its six three-pointers in the second quarter. Igniting the Gauchos’ long-range shooting was freshman guard Coco Miller with two three-pointers. She concluded Thursday with 13 points on a 5-13 overall and 2-7 three-point shooting effort.</p>\n<p>A make from behind the perimeter by senior guard Dioseline Lopez brought the Gauchos within one-point of CSUN’s lead at 22-23.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 0-5 three-point shooting start in the first quarter, UCSB remained committed to its shot selection from beyond the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“I always tell those two [Roper and Miller] to shoot until your arm falls off,” Henrickson said. “Even if you’ve missed three or four, we all expect the next one to go and they have to have that mentality.”</p>\n<p>With a 27-26 lead, it was a three-pointer at the buzzer by Roper that shifted the momentum to UCSB’s advantage while extending the Gauchos’ lead to 30-26 at the half.</p>\n<p>“It all started with our defense, especially because we had a slow start,” Roper said. “Coach [Henrickson] really emphasized pressure on the defensive end in getting us better looks on offense.”</p>\n<p>Roper capitalized off the buzzer shot, scoring UCSB’s first field goal of the second half from beyond the arc while her last three-point basket of the game with 1:15 in the third handed the Gauchos their first double-figure lead of the game at 46-36.</p>\n<p>For the remainder of the game, Northridge trailed by a double-figure deficit. Its ability to get to the free-throw, where it made 11-14 in the second half, did not permit it to keep up with UCSB’s scoring pace.</p>\n<p>Although Fluker registered 19 of her 31 points in the second half, the Matadors were overcome by the Gauchos’ 51.6 field goal percentage in the final two quarters. In addition to Roper and Miller, senior guard Jasmine Ware’s 5-10 shooting performance and total of 10 points off the bench helped UCSB secure its 70-58 victory.</p>\n<p>Next on UCSB’s schedule is Long Beach State this Saturday, Feb. 20 at 2 p.m. The 49ers endured an 83-58 loss to UC Riverside Thursday night, bringing them to 18-7 overall and 7-4 in conference play. UCSB, currently in fifth-place of the Big West standings, could tie LBSU for fourth-place in the conference with a victory on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/","id":345,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[344,343,342],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
