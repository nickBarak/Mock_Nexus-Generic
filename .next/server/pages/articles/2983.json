Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night to discuss new amendments and bills regarding the recording of Senate meetings, the upcoming Student of Color Conference and capabilities to remove A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau began the discussion by addressing the current bills in question and moved the conversation to Senate member inquiries before allowing time for public forum.</p>\n<p>Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, gave an update prior to public forum about an ongoing housing shortage for international students.</p>\n<p>“We’re currently trying to work with them to find out how many have and don’t have housing at the moment,” O’Brien said. “What I’ve been told is that, for whatever reason, the housing market has been impacted and that it was an unexpected thing. The school isn’t overenrolled, the students are just having difficulty finding housing.”</p>\n<p>After public forum, a motion was introduced to permit the videotaping of Senate meetings in order to have them available for public viewing. The motion was voted on and then sent to the Constitution and Bylaws Committee for further consideration.</p>\n<p>Diversity Educator for the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) Kyron Covington requested Senate funding for the upcoming Student of Color Conference, to take place on Nov. 7 to 9 at UC Merced. Covington said the conference was a chance for students of color to discuss issues relevant to “color culture” and their specific universities.</p>\n<p>“It is a chance to celebrate students of color culture and talk about issues that they can bring back to their respective campuses,” Covington said.</p>\n<p>Senator Liam Stanton also requested A.S. President Ali Guthy to fund the Student of Color Conference with presidential funds. Guthy said an examination of the budget was necessary before any funds could be appropriated.</p>\n<p>Third-year literature major and former Student Advocate General Bailey Loverin also sponsored an update to A.S. Legal Code Article VII Sections 3 and 8-10, with the intent of preventing what she alleged was the unjust removal of A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“[The bill] does not allow executives to remove appointed officers without consent of the Senate,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez brought up issues of student health and the possibility of establishing “peace zones” in the school to aid students dealing with various stages of post-traumatic stress.</p>\n<p>“The administration and the Chancellor are working together to develop peaceful areas in the school for students to be able to relax,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>Senate questions were addressed towards the end of the meeting, with Lau encouraging Senators to spread news of the upcoming special A.S. Election for Student Advocate General and External Vice President of Local Affairs in order to gain results reflective of the entire student body.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57251\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57251\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/","id":2983,"author":{"id":171,"name":"Diana Bounina"},"related":[2982,2981,2980],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":171,"name":"Diana Bounina","biography":"Not available","articles":[2955,2983],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Ornelas is the chair and will only vote in tie-breaking instances.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Executive Director Marisela Marquez and representatives from the office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Environmental Affairs Board will serve as non-voting ex-officio members.</p>\n<p><b>“</b>Every year that I’ve lived in I.V., my house has had mold in the bathroom,” Ornelas said at the meeting Wednesday evening. “That really comes down to lack of proper ventilation, and then when you have multiple people using these same facilities, it’s just always going to be like wet and damp in there paired with just the climate that we have here.”</p>\n<p>“It just creates the perfect conditions for mold to grow in new spaces and it’s really toxic and can be damaging to health.”</p>\n<p>The committee is tasked with developing a survey to distribute in I.V., publishing the survey results and bringing back its recommendations for how to address the mold problem to the Senate.</p>\n<p>The resolution notes that there are over 9,500 UC Santa Barbara students living in I.V., many of whom have expressed concerns about mold in their homes, particularly with the number of students living in each residence.</p>\n<p>“…students living in Isla Vista often have multiple housemates and roommates requiring them to all use common facilities,” the resolution writes.</p>\n<p>“having multiple people share these facilities throughout the day, without proper ventilation can create a warm, damp, and humid environment which perpetuates mold growth.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also said at the meeting Wednesday evening that he spoke with A.S. Legal Resource Center Attorney Ron Perry over the summer about how students could address mold. He learned that laws about mold were vague because of the range of molds that exist and their varying levels of harm to residents.</p>\n<p>The resolution also notes that “some Isla Vista landlords have begun adding mold clauses to their leases which relinquish responsibility for dealing with mold entirely up to tenants.”</p>\n<p>The committee plans to report back to Senate on a weekly basis and by the end of Winter Quarter, make a decision on the future on the committee.</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.4 of the Jan. 10 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Map courtesy of <em>sedgwick.nrs.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>On Monday, the university announced that alumna Linda Duttenhaver donated $2 million towards the restoration of a 1950s ranch house on Sedgwick Reserve which accommodates affiliated researchers from half of the approximately 40 projects on the reserve.</p>\n<p>The donation will go towards bringing the Sedgwick ranch house up-to-date with fire and building codes, followed by renovating the facility to make it more comfortable and functional for residents. The Sedgwick Reserve is located 40 miles north of campus in the Santa Ynez Valley and is one of seven reserves managed by the university’s Natural Reserve System (NRS), a branch of the greater UC Natural Reserve System which oversees 39 reserves in total throughout the state.</p>\n<p>According to Sedgwick Reserve Resident Director Kate McCurdy, the money may be used to update specific parts of the house.</p>\n<p>“We hope to modernize the really funky old 1950s kitchen, to make it useful for people to cook,” McCurdy said. “Right now the house is set up in a dorm style with lots of bunk beds so we’re also going to replace the bunk beds with double beds.”</p>\n<p>Patricia Holden, professor of environmental microbiology in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management and director of the Natural Reserve System, said the mission of the UC NRS is to “support broadly university level research, education and public outreach.”</p>\n<p>According to Holden, all UC NRS projects are “approached with the lens of sustainability,” and make energy and water conservation an important criteria throughout the design process.</p>\n<p>“We currently produce our own energy here with solar panels,” McCurdy said. “Now we want to replace the windows and possibly do rainwater capture off the roof, and also replace the heating system so it is more energy efficient.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy said Duttenhaver is “one of those rare gem alumni,” who has made significant contributions to Sedgwick Reserve over the last few years.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important to her to see students use what they’re learning in the classroom out in the field,” McCurdy said. “She definitely recognizes that having a decent place to stay when you’re out on the edge of wilderness is very important. For students and faculty to really be inspired by the place they’re working at, they need to be comfortable and safe.”</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said some of Duttenhaver’s past donations have aided the renovation of the ranch’s historic barn, as well as the development of an outreach program.</p>\n<p>“That barn was so close to falling over and it was pretty scary to be in there on a windy day because you could see the whole thing moving,” McCurdy said. “So she really did save that from the brink of collapse. Then our outreach program allows us to have public hikes and a lecture series. So without her help it would be pretty quiet out here.”</p>\n<p>NRS Business Officer Donna Moore said the NRS provides researchers and students a protected environment for their studies.</p>\n<p>“Researchers can come and set up an experiment or classes can come and get involved in a project and they know that it won’t be disturbed,” said Moore. “It also protects the area, keeping them as restored to their original condition as they could possibly be, and gives researchers a place to stay and keep their equipment.”</p>\n<p>Various research efforts are pursued at the reserve within fields including botany, archaeology, microbiology and geology. According to McCurdy, native plants and animals thrive in an undisturbed habitat. Additionally, a telescope is also being used at the Sedgwick Reserve by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Network, a nonprofit network of robotic telescopes used for science and education.</p>\n<p>“We are sort of at the southern end of the Transverse Range and we have a unique soil type that is high in turpentine that invasive plants don’t do very well in, so we have a lot of native plants that aren’t found elsewhere,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>McCurdy also said a grant has been submitted to gain funding for the construction of a 24-bed dormitory adjacent to the ranch house, with a groundbreaking set for 2016.</p>\n<p>“Classes will then be able to use the dorm and researchers and people who are staying longer will be able to use the ranch house,” McCurdy said.</p>\n<p>According to McCurdy, Sedgwick Reserve is “a little national park” and a place where “you will never know what you’re going to encounter.” McCurdy also said the reserve offers visitors many surprises and a natural habitat worth protecting.</p>\n<p>“What amazes me about this property is how enormous and rich it is,” McCurdy said. “You can see deer and bears and eagles, or you may see animal tracks or a freshly killed deer that a mountain lion just killed. So there’s evidence of just how biologically important this place is. This really is the perfect place to have a reserve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Reul, discussed their respective agendas for this year’s special election on Tuesday at a public forum at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The Student Advocate General is an Associated Students executive officer and acts as a public defender for the students under university policy. The special election comes after third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected to the SAG position last Spring, abdicated the position because of personal medical issues.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim and Reul addressed issues such as student outreach and the efficiency and productivity of the SAG office.  When asked about the role of the SAG, the candidates stressed different parts of the job, with Ibrahim emphasizing the role of assistance that SAG provides for students.</p>\n<p>“The job of the Student Advocate General is to facilitate communication between the students and the university,” Ibrahim said. “If a student is in trouble for cheating or dealing with harassment, our job is to advise them on what to do. The student advocacy general should be a resource that is always available for students to advise them on whatever issue that they may be having,” Ibrahim said.</p>\n<p>Reul said the SAG should serve as a direct link between students and the university, advocating for students to university administration.</p>\n<p>“We are the only office in the executive that directly deals with the students,” Reul said. “The role of the Student Advocate General is to not only amplify the voice of the students, but also to give them resources to assist themselves.”</p>\n<p>When asked about informing students regarding the Office of the Student Advocate, both candidates agreed on hosting more events to educate students about the office.</p>\n<p>Reul said he plans on continuing the outreach program that Loverin began last year in addition to the casework department.</p>\n<p>“We are going to hire more casework staff to enhance the outreach output,” Reul said. “We are going to host regular events in I.V. and in residence halls to tell people about SAG.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said he also supported the outreach program and discussed other ways to reach out to students.</p>\n<p>“I will let students know that this resource is available to them,” Ibrahim said. “I will definitely utilize Facebook as a platform to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>Both candidates said events in Isla Vista, such as Deltopia and Halloween, have gotten out of hand. Both candidates also discussed the role of on-campus events to deter students from going to I.V., but each are looking for different ways to do so.</p>\n<p>“With everything that has happened last year, these events have become really unsafe,” Ibrahim said. “Whether it is from the presence of people from out of town or the increased police presence that has made people feel uncomfortable. We really need to focus on keeping it local and safe.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said she supported events such as the upcoming concert on Friday, because of their potential to reduce student participation in the Halloween festivities.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Residence Hall Association, Reul emphasized the role that RHA can play during these events.</p>\n<p>“I feel that these events have gotten unwieldy,” Reul said. “We can provide alternatives to these events. RHA does hold events that are not only for the residence hall members but also for the community at large. We can make these events fun and also safe.”</p>\n<p>However, the candidates disagreed on how they would increase the efficiency of the SAG.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said measures should be put in place to ensure a more productive working environment.</p>\n<p>“There should be a reapplication process to make sure there is a really good work dynamic,” Ibrahim said. “I honestly feel that a good work dynamic can help increase efficiency. Also, assigning very specific duties to the staff because all of the duties are broad.”</p>\n<p>Reul also said he will seek to increase productivity by allowing students new ways to submit their cases.</p>\n<p>“We intend to increase efficiency by reinventing our website to make sure that cases can be submitted online with near-instant response,” Reul said. “We are going to have office hours in residence halls.”</p>\n<p>In their closing statements, Reul reiterated his experience in the OSA, while Ibrahim emphasized her association with numerous organizations on campus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57520\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57520\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/","id":2982,"author":{"id":175,"name":"Rishika Kenkre"},"related":[2981,2980,2979],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
