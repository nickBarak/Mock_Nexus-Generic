\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite having represented the Big West in the College World Series last season, the Titans have struggled in 2018. To begin the year, CSUF was ranked No. 10 in the nation, however, a tough preseason schedule has led to its modest overall mark thus far. In their non-conference schedule, Fullerton has played No. 1 Oregon State, No. 3 Stanford and No. UCLA.</p>\n<p>All-time, this series has been very one-sided as the Titans have amassed a 104-39 record against the Gauchos including a 49-19 record at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. 2014 was the last time UCSB defeated Cal State Fullerton in a three-game series.</p>\n<p>Overall, the key for the Gauchos this weekend will be to continue building off its recent success. Recently, the Santa Barbara starting weekend pitching staff has been solid as in the last five games and 27 innings they have only given up an average of 1.33 runs per game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Chris Lincoln has been a huge part of this success. In his first two career Saturday starts, the Rancho Verde alum has only given up 2.53 runs per game in 10.2 inning pitched while also striking out nine batters. Overall, Lincoln has a 1.93 ERA this season.</p>\n<p>Similarly, senior Stevie Ledesma has also made a strong transition from the bullpen into a weekend starter. The SBCC transfer has posted a 0.81 ERA in his two Sunday starts while striking out five.</p>\n<p>With success coming in the latter starts, UCSB knows it needs more production from game one starter Jack Dashwood. The freshman has shown flashes of brilliance with his strong arm, but has also shown weaknesses.</p>\n<p>In six starts, the left-handed pitcher has accumulated a 4.78 ERA with a 1-3 record. However, Dashwood has only given up six runs in his last three starts.</p>\n<p>This, along with a revived offense is what has helped the Gauchos hit their stride a bit. The Gauchos are slashing .291/.384/.451 as a team in March and have hit 11 dingers. This compared to a .204/.309/.295 line and one homer in February shows the positive trend for this team.</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Tommy Jew has been a big factor in this department for the ‘Chos. In the month of March, Jew has recorded a hit 11 of UCSB’s 13 games including five games with multiple hits.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Jew has clipped an incredible .395 in the month of March to go along with 13 RBI’s and two home runs. The California native’s .324 batting average ranks ninth in the Big West while his .457 OBP ranks fifth and his .485 slugging ranks 12th.</p>\n<p>Defensively, Jew has also been incredible in the outfield. His diving catch a couple days ago against Pepperdine saved the Gauchos in the bottom of the 10th in what would’ve resulted in a loss had the ball fell.</p>\n<p>For the Titans, relying on sophomore catcher Daniel Cope will continue to be important. Cope has tallied hits in 13 of his last 15 batting .344 with three home runs, nine RBI’s and 12 runs. On March 12th, Cope earned his first career Big West player of the year.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is a huge opportunity for the Gauchos to catch a struggling Titans team while their down. UCSB has not won a regular-season conference title in the Andrew Checketts’ era, and in a season where it has struggled in conference play, it might need to if it wants to make it to the postseason.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins a three-game series against CSUF at 3 p.m. on Thursday, March 29 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Arellano, the fifth-rated LHP in California, recorded 51 strikeouts in 38 innings last season for Downey High School and was drafted in the 36th round by the Indians.</p>\n<p>Fariss featured as a two-way star at Valencia High School in California, hitting .368 as a senior outfielder while also pitching his way to a 3.43 ERA.</p>\n<p>In addition to these recruits, UCSB will return star shortstop Clay Fisher, who opted to return for his senior year rather than go pro due to circumstances outside his control.</p>\n<p>Fisher’s season was cut short by Tommy John surgery last year, and he will be welcomed back with open arms after hitting .353 his sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>UCSB won’t have much time to adjust, as they take on San Diego State to open the season Feb.16.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs, who finished last season 41-19 and advanced to the regional semifinals, will present a stark challenge for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After coming home for their opener against Fresno State, UCSB must take on a formidable Mississippi State team that reached the Super Regionals last year as part of the Kleberg Bank Classic Tournament in Texas.</p>\n<p>Other notable non-conference games include a home series against Penn State March 3, as well as a three-game homestand against reigning WAC conference champion Sacramento State beginning March 16.</p>\n<p>After its final nonconference game March 27 at Pepperdine, UCSB will return home to begin conference play against Cal State Fullerton, a perennial contender in the Big West who reached the College World Series last year.</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara lost two of its three games against Fullerton, and the game will allow the Gauchos to gauge whether they will be contenders or pretenders in the conference this season.</p>\n<p>April features primarily conference games for the Gauchos, with a home and away game interspersed against USC.</p>\n<p>UCSB swept the Pac-12 school last year in their two games, and will look to do more of the same this season during the midweek matchups.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the season, Santa Barbara will get its hand at Long Beach State, the 2017 Big West champion who beat Santa Barbara in two of its three matchups last year.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos hope to contend in the Big West this season, they will likely need to win the series against the 49ers, which begins May 11.</p>\n<p>With a much healthier, more experienced team and an abundance of talented recruits, UCSB will look to prove that last season was merely a fluke and that this year’s team can replicate the Cinderella success that this team was able to find in 2016.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

I could have punched him in the nose … or I could have started screaming, or at least yelled ‘get the fuck off of me.’ But I don’t know what it is … there’s this shame of, ‘I should’ve stood up for myself because I respected myself.’ And the moment I didn’t, so what does that say about what happened, you know what I mean?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get him to let her go, Doe said she told Smith that she needed to say goodbye to her friends “because they’re waiting for me” and told him she would “come right back.” She left and texted a group chat at 11:42 p.m. that night “CODE RED” and “where are you guys” in messages she showed the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She returned to her house with a group of friends, “and we were in my room, you know, crying, and I was a little in shock, like I had no idea what was going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another friend who discovered Doe in her room during this time spoke to the Nexus and independently verified Doe’s recounting of the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Doe’s friend went to get her water, she learned of a second woman returning to their house who had allegedly also been sexually assaulted by Smith after Doe left the Sigma Pi fraternity house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said it was this instance that pushed her to report the incident to Macke the next morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t gonna say anything, which looking back is crazy, you know what I mean? Because you should always say something,” Doe said. “Right when I found out it was beyond me, I was like, ‘I need to report this.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning, she called a close friend in Sigma Pi, who arranged a meeting between her and Macke. She said she met with Macke at noon, and at 3:41 p.m. that day, she received a text from her friend in Sigma Pi saying “he’s dropped,” referring to Smith.</span></p>\n<p><b>How Greek Life Responded: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the events of Oct. 3, Sigma Pi canceled its Midnight Madness party — one of the parties typically held every year by nearly all UCSB fraternities following the completion of rush week – Macke said in a message to the other Greek life presidents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks later, on Oct. 17, the university sent out an alert about </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/two-incidents-involving-date-rape-drugs-reported-at-fraternity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two reported incidents involving date-rape drugs on Oct. 5 at an unnamed fraternity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The university’s alert sparked heavy backlash on social media both from students and local community members, with many taking issue with the fact that the university had not included the name of the fraternity involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe told the Nexus that the incidents of sexual assault that she reported to Macke were unrelated to the reported use of date-rape drugs mentioned in the alert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the university alert, the UCSB Interfraternity Council (IFC) announced in an email on Oct. 18 to all IFC members that they had decided to place a five-day suspension on “all fraternity social activities” between Oct. 18 and the morning of Oct. 23. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to suspend all social activities was made “in light of an unprecedented level of misconduct from fraternity members and concerns from local law enforcement and University administration about systemic issues within the fraternity system,” according to the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the circulation of the fraternity member’s Facebook profile, rumors have spread around campus and Isla Vista regarding the location and alleged perpetrator of the sexual assaults. Sigma Pi’s name was mentioned by several social media accounts; one social justice-oriented Instagram account scheduled a protest walk against Sigma Pi before canceling it later that day to “give time for the victims to heal,” they wrote in a </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B32hT8YH80r/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said she agreed to speak with the Nexus because she needed to set the record straight. She emphasized that what happened to her “isn’t a Sigma Pi problem, and it’s not a Greek life problem. It’s a hookup culture problem.” She added that Macke and other Sigma Pi members have “been there every second of the way.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That shit probably happens all the time — at parties that aren’t even Greek-affiliated, you know?” she said. “What’s crazy about this is I’m grateful in a weird way that he was in a frat, because it was taken care of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though nobody knows it’s us, we’ve gone out with friends and they’ve been like, ‘Did you hear about those girls who got raped?’ That sucks […] I don’t want it to be like that — I want it to be like, ‘Did you hear about that guy that did that horrible thing? Fuck people like that.’”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E.) can be reached through a 24-hour advocacy line at </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(805) 893-4613 and </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S.) has a 24-hour confidential crisis counseling line at (805) 893-4411. </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus and community resources for individuals impacted by sexual violence, sexual harassment or other prohibited behavior can be accessed </span></i><a href=\"https://oeosh.ucsb.edu/titleix/local.response.procedures.and.resources/Campus.and.Community.Resources.for.Individuals.Impacted.by.Sexual.Violence.Sexual.Harassment.or.Other.Prohibited.Behavior.pdf\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here.</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Jackson, Simren Verma and Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
