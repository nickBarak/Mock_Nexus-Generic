Recently, White Reaper, a Kentucky-based quintet rock band, headlined a concert at SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club downtown along with supporting acts The Aquadolls and Native Sun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening up the night was Native Sun, a fast-paced rock band from New York.</span><a href=\"https://www.nativesunyc.com/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-described</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as, “unabashedly reimagining the sound of white Americana through their (mostly) brown mouths” and “empowered by the will to make music against all hostility,” the four-piece band is comprised of all immigrant members: Danny Gomez (lead vocals and guitar), Jake Pflum (guitar), Mauricio Martínez (bass) and Alexis Castro (drums).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they made their way on stage and got familiar with their designated instruments, the dance floor of SOhO began to quickly fill up with excited fans, eager to begin moshing the night away.  Immediately, Native Sun set the mood for the night with their first song, “Hippie Speedball,” a popular track from their 2018 EP “Always Different, Always the Same.” While Santa Barbara is usually a place for the calm and quiet, singer Gomez brought a vibrant energy to the SOhO stage with his unwavering voice and aggressive guitar playing skills. Native Sun continued their set with more tracks like “Palindrome,” “Juarez” and “Oedipus Race,” and successfully got the crowd on their feet and hyped up for the next two bands.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a quick break, The Aquadolls soon took the floor and didn’t hesitate in building off the energy generated by Native Sun’s performance. Comprised of founding member Melissa Brooks (lead vocals and guitar) and new additions Jackie Proctor (backup vocals and drums) and Keilah Nina (backup vocals and bass), The Aquadolls are currently on tour promoting their most recent 2019 single, “Suck on This,” and their second album, “The Dream and the Deception,” which was self-produced and recorded on Aqua Babe Records in October of 2018. With an all-female roster, The Aquadolls brought a sense of femininity to the SOhO stage that worked to amplify their unique, DIY, heavy surf-rock sound.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93487\" style=\"width: 746px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"518499154\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93481\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93487\" data-attachment-id=\"93487\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/white-reaper-wakes-up-santa-barbara-with-concert-at-soho/img-3405/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg?fit=736%2C615&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"736,615\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG-3405\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg?fit=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg?fit=736%2C615&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93487\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg?resize=736%2C615\" alt=\"\" width=\"736\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg?w=736&amp;ssl=1 736w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg?resize=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3405.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93487\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristina Valencia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full of confidence and excitement, Brooks often incited the crowd to sing and dance along to their set, shouting, “Alright Santa Barbara, put your hands up! Put ‘em up, put ‘em up!” during instrumental breaks in their songs. Enthusiastically playing throughout their allotted time, The Aquadolls played a majority of their discography, including older songs like “Rich Boyz” as well as newer ones like “Runaway (The Jam)” and “Cigboi.” As if their musical abilities weren’t enough, The Aquadolls strutted the SOhO stage adorned in spunky yet girly outfits; with lead singer Brooks sporting white knee-high socks, black and white platform creepers and a beret that was soon head-banged off her endless, wavy blonde hair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, it was time for the headliner to come onstage: White Reaper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike The Aquadolls, White Reaper is composed of an all-male ensemble: Tony Esposito (vocals and guitar), Hunter Thompson (guitar), Ryan Hater (keyboard), Sam Wilkerson (bass) and Nick Wilkerson (drums). Since the release of their most recent album, “You Deserve Love,” White Reaper has been relishing in the spotlight with their hit song, “Might Be Right,” which reached the</span><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/charts/alternative-songs/2020-02-15\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 1 spot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the Billboard Alternative Songs Chart this past February. However, while this may currently be White Reaper’s most popular track, their recent appearance at SOhO proves they are more than one-hit wonders.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93486\" style=\"width: 1135px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1213897986\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93481\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93486\" data-attachment-id=\"93486\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/white-reaper-wakes-up-santa-barbara-with-concert-at-soho/img-3398/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?fit=1125%2C632&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1125,632\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG-3398\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?fit=888%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-93486 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?w=1125&amp;ssl=1 1125w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?resize=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3398.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93486\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristina Valencia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, when White Reaper made their way onto the colorfully lit stage, they were quickly welcomed by a swarm of cheers and claps from the standing audience. Their casual attire and mellow attitude as they picked up their instruments seemed to emit a subtle calmness to the crowd, which was soon disrupted as they began to perform “Headwind,” the opening track of their 2019 album.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon enough, the packed SOhO night club (which is located on the second story of the building) was jumping along with the music of White Reaper, and I grew frightened at the thought of falling through the floor </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I guess that’s how you know it’s a good show. In between the intense rock songs, lead singer Esposito often requested the band be brought shots of tequila while they caught their breath, scanned their setlist and joked around with their fans. Upon receiving his shots, Esposito said with a laugh, “I mean I’m holding a tequila shot… How much worse could it get?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night went on, White Reaper continued to connect with their fans throughout their hour-and-a-half set with witty banter. “You guys like Dave Matthews or what?” guitarist Thompson mused. “Well, yeah, we’re in Santa Barbara.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although White Reaper maintained the audience’s interest as they played through their discography, the anticipation for “Might Be Right” felt almost palpable throughout the dance floor. Soon enough, Hater said into his keyboard mic, “I think I start this one, guys,” and the enchanting synth introduction to the hit song flooded the SOhO speakers as the stage became entrenched in blue light. “You like that?” Thompson prodded. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, yes we do.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93482\" style=\"width: 1135px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"870292586\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93481\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93482\" data-attachment-id=\"93482\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/white-reaper-wakes-up-santa-barbara-with-concert-at-soho/img-3399/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?fit=1125%2C624&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1125,624\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG-3399\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?fit=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?fit=888%2C493&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93482\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?resize=888%2C493\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?w=1125&amp;ssl=1 1125w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?resize=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?resize=1024%2C568&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-3399.jpg?resize=768%2C426&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93482\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristina Valencia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the live rendition of “Might Be Right” sounded a little slower than its studio-recorded counterpart, White Reaper demonstrated their true musical capabilities as they jammed through the widely loved track. And, all too soon, the once colorful and bright lights turned black, and it was time for White Reaper’s set to end… Or was it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, White Reaper followed their fans’ commands and trotted back onstage for a final encore performance of blink-182 covers. Though they weren’t playing their own music, this was a rather fun way to end such a rockin’ show, and it was refreshing to see the band not only not taking themselves too seriously, but genuinely enjoying themselves along with the rest of us in attendance. Ending the night with nostalgic bangers like “All The Small Things,” White Reaper left fans with high energies and blissed-out grins on their faces as the SOhO show came to a close.</span></p><div

Schaben</p></div>\n<p>Tyler, the Creator brought weirdos together for the eighth year at his annual Camp Flog Gnaw music festival, giving fans a weekend of seesawing emotions. Flog Gnaw took over Dodger Stadium for the second time, wrapping up Tyler’s most successful year, after his latest project “IGOR” reached No. 1 album in the country. However, the customer satisfaction rate was not at 100%, with fans still asking “Where’s Frank?” at the end of the festival weekend.</p>\n<p>Arriving at Camp Flog Gnaw this year was no different than the year preceding it. With a lineup geared toward the R&amp;B genre, the festival was host to thousands of youthful attendees all dressed in their finest attire, with no two outfits being the same. The dedicated music fans all rushed in as the doors opened, already wrapped up in the spirit of the festival. The rest of the crowd could be seen taking out their small Ziplocs of fun-colored pills, powders, puffables and other precious paraphernalia from their bags after clearing security.</p>\n<p>Once the business at security was handled, fans were able to enjoy their trip at a festival-goers wonderland, complete with the usual games, rides, merch stands, a PopTarts party and plenty of photo opportunities. Attendants were set free to stomp and stumble around the grounds, gawking at the wide spectrum of color and sound that the festival had to offer, with plenty of medical tents throughout the venue.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On day one, crowds could be seen growing in size around the time of Thundercat’s set, five hours after the doors opened. By then, the crowd was at a comfortable level with their inebriation — heavy-eyed, heavy-armed and ready to digest the music of some of the industry’s most talented artists. Thundercat gave the crowd what they needed, delivering funky yet hectic, jazz-fusion tunes, dedicating a couple to his cat and one to his late friend and acclaimed rapper Mac Miller.</p>\n<p>The Internet was up next and supplied audience members with an enchanting journey through neo-soul performed in front of a sunset, which was highly fitting for their soothing melodies. Summer Walker followed in the schedule, bringing along not one but two pole dancers to accompany her sexy and provoking ballads. She even invited a couple of fans on stage to work the pole and show what they had. Daniel Caesar soon hit the stage, singing his pain away through highly personal and intimate lyrics, executed with a stunning vocal performance.</p>\n<p>Five minutes after his set, it was Tyler’s turn. He proved to be a good host, giving everyone a theatrical set complete with spark showers to fit his grand productions. But the night didn’t end there, with 21 Savage bringing his aggressive and violent flow to the show, at one point displaying a short video which followed his previous deportation to the UK. After moshing to 21, fans spent the comedown listening to Solange’s sweet songs, taking in the final energies of night one.</p>\n<p>It was time for day two, and there was still the lingering question of who was going to be the final headliner, with our only official clue being three taunting question marks. Still, there somehow seemed to be an agreement among everyone that it was going to be Frank Ocean.</p>\n<p>Attendees suppressed their Frank Ocean anticipation and trekked on through day two, with Blood Orange being the first artist to draw in a huge crowd. Taking his musical mastery with him on stage, he not only sang but also frequently alternated between playing intense guitar and upright bass solos.</p>\n<p>Brockhampton was after, performing inside a living room set with an airplane crashed through its wall, bringing the boy-band bops that the group is known for. Following that set, the night was about to gradually slip its way into controversy starting with YG’s set as he brought out special guests like Shoreline Mafia, DJ Mustard and Tyga. However, his most exciting guest was introduced with his anti-Trump anthem, “FDT.” YG brought out Trump’s alleged ex-lover, Stormy Daniels, to share a few unfavorable words about the POTUS, ending with a collective “Fuck Donald Trump!” from the crowd. After YG, fans were ready for the answer to the mystery of the final Flog Gnaw headliner, many sending in their final prayers that it would be Frank Ocean.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91280\" style=\"width: 1558px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1403162416\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91277\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91280\" data-attachment-id=\"91280\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/a-weekend-of-music-fun-and-boos-camp-flog-gnaw-19/stormy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?fit=1548%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1548,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"stormy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?fit=888%2C587&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91280\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?resize=888%2C587\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?w=1548&amp;ssl=1 1548w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?resize=1024%2C677&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stormy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Camp Flog Gnaw/Goldenvoice</p></div>\n<p>Soon, Tyler walked out and asked, “Could I bring a few friends out, would that be ok?” which was answered with a storm of affirmative screams. First to emerge from backstage was Lord Pretty Flacko himself, A$AP Rocky, showing up to get the crowd moving for two of his songs before walking offstage. Tyler then returned and asked “Can I bring out another friend?” and welcomed Lil Uzi Vert on stage, electrifying the audience with his infectious enthusiasm. Uzi finished after two songs, prompting Tyler again. “Can I …,” he started until he was cut off by the crowd’s noise. And then he stepped out — not Frank Ocean, but Drake, international superstar, initially being warmly welcomed by the fans. His setlist included some of his most popular bangers, but also some deep album cuts performed beautifully by the current king of pop. As he wrapped up his set, he asked if the crowd wanted more. But as they were still expecting Frank to close the show, many responded with boos and screams of no. The show ended there, with Drake saying goodbye to Camp Flog Gnaw. “It’s been love. I love y’all. I go by the name of Drake,” he said. “Thank y’all for having me.”</p>\n<p>As everyone marched in unison back to their cars, most were left disappointed with the way the night ended. Some were mad that it wasn’t Frank, while others were mad at the way the crowd treated Drake.</p>\n<p>“That’s Drake, the number one artist in the world! How y’all gonna show Juice WRLD love, but not Drake? Fuck Frank!” said one festival attendant.</p>\n<p>The weekend had been a testament to youth and the possibilities that being a kid can offer. Even though the weekend ended on a sour note, many left having accomplished what they set out to do: enjoy themselves. They had finished off a weekend of arguably too many substances in one piece, coming out with a few more stories to tell. Camp Flog Gnaw made history once again, leaving Dodger Stadium upside down and covered in drug remnants. Tyler truly knows how to throw a party.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/18609206087000bb8fe9efdd06266e6c?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/18609206087000bb8fe9efdd06266e6c?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omarreyes/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Reyes</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div class=\"adn ads\" data-message-id=\"#msg-f:1665730798728604702\" data-legacy-message-id=\"171ddd5605a56c1e\">\n<div class=\"gs\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div id=\":rj\" class=\"ii gt\">\n<div id=\":ri\" class=\"a3s aXjCH \">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Omar Reyes is a reporter from Port Hueneme, California.

fits the mold of those who came before him. Before the release of his debut album in 2018, he had already shattered records on YouTube, amassing over 4 billion streams, and had a slew of high-profile features under his belt. Within a year of his discovery on SoundCloud by veteran producer DJ Luian, Bad Bunny was his native island’s most esteemed reggaetonero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reggaeton, heavily influenced by American hip-hop, took shape in the streets of Puerto Rico in the 1990s and has defined an entire generation of the island’s youth. Bad Bunny, who grew up with aspirations to become the Daddy Yankee of his time, has undeniably altered the landscape of the genre with his commitment to stay true to his craft.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“YHLQMDLG,” which stands for “Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana” and translates to “I Do Whatever I Want,” is El Conejo Malo’s second full-length project. In contrast to his critically acclaimed debut release, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">X 100pre,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which was defined by its moody lyrics over heavily-slung beats, this album features an equally reflective but much more easygoing Bad Bunny. There are, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of course, songs in which he is pining over an ex and imagining what he would say to her mom if he ran into her (“Si Veo a Tu Mamá”) or is struggling to come to terms with the end of a relationship (“Ignorantes”). This time around, however, Bad Bunny taps into a more uplifted and eccentric side of himself to give his fans more of a “puro perreo” playlist. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging as the global ambassador for the new wave of música urbana in recent years, Bad Bunny is more ambitious than ever on “YHLQMDLG,” and if initial streams are any indication, his artistic risks have yielded favorable returns.

With an impressive range of beat transitions to underscore the reggaetonero reveling in how much he is going to party with women that night, this percussive track is arguably the most reminiscent of the sounds once confined to the underground scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bad Bunny has accomplished more than most artists achieve throughout their entire career. Once a college student working in a grocery store, his career skyrocketed to new heights within months of signing to a label. In two years, he has released three albums, picked up three Grammy nominations, headlined a tour, performed at the Super Bowl and emerged as one of this generation’s forefront activists. With so much pressure riding on him, Bad Bunny is not afraid to admit that his lifestyle has taken a toll on him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album ends with “&lt;3,” a thank you note for the unwavering support of those who believed in the trap star from the very beginning. Bad Bunny acknowledges that he is blessed to be able to live out his dream, but ultimately, the fame has made him sick: “Pero hablando claro, gente, ya ni duermo/ Y esto de la fama me tiene hasta enfermo.” He reveals that he wants to retire after releasing one last album, which he plans to drop in the next nine months. With this closing track, he makes one thing abundantly clear: San Benito really does do whatever he wants. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-93523\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pitchfork</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady Gaga has returned after a four-year gap since her last studio album with a new hyper-addictive track, “</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6xyaeiV58\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stupid Love</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” The song comes after Gaga’s acting career took off with “A Star Is Born” (2018), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination in 2019. A soundtrack was recorded alongside the film, including Gaga’s fourth No. 1 hit with “Shallow,” a duet with co-star Bradley Cooper, perfect for radio stations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaga’s 2016 studio album, “Joanne,” released two years before “A Star Is Born,” was a tribute to her late aunt of the same name and included a stripped-down approach to music that inspired </span><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/man-of-the-woods/1330759954\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Timberlake</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rainbow/1253656856\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kesha</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/golden/1336206506\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kylie Minogue</span> </a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to do the same. It invited themes of soft and mellow rock, alt-pop and piano ballads, but longtime fans were disappointed with the departure of Gaga’s signature electro-pop sounds of “Born This Way,” “Just Dance” and “Bad Romance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Stupid Love,” off the upcoming album “Chromatica” (to be released April 10), is a return to form for Gaga. Its synths, pulsating beats and addicting vocal chops rivaling Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Now That I Found You” in the chorus suggest that the record will be a pop explosion of fun. Just listening to the song once gets you hooked, and the natural increase of intensity, so integral in a pop song, is in play here; the ad-lib, “Woo!” is reminiscent of a ‘70s disco track and the change of “I want your stupid love” to the emphatic “We got a stupid love” gives the ending a punch.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The music video was filmed completely on the iPhone 11 Pro as a part of Apple’s “Shot on iPhone” campaign, which includes the video for Selena Gomez’s recent No. 1 hit “Lose You To Love Me.” It features Gaga in several futuristic pink outfits dancing alongside groups of people wearing different colors (such as green, red, black and blue), and by the end, everyone is dancing alongside her. Though the video is silly, and Gaga’s dance moves are somewhat erratic, it looks like she’s having the time of her life.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93524\" style=\"width: 703px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1712498391\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"93522\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93524\" data-attachment-id=\"93524\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-13/track-review-stupid-love-by-lady-gaga/lg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LG\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-93524\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?resize=693%2C390\" alt=\"\" width=\"693\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LG.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93524\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Entertainment Tonight</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyrically, the song is about falling for someone we hadn’t had our sights on at first, acknowledging it and finally giving in to the temptation. In the pre-chorus, she laments, “All I ever wanted was love,” which paves the way for her to admit, “I want your stupid love.” It reads like someone putting on a reluctant front but hasn’t given in to her feelings just yet. In the chorus, the narrative changes, and the love allures her to drop all reservations and fall headfirst for this person. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the song had been subjected to leaks and reveals before its announcement. Gaga posted a picture of the words “FUCK THIS” painted onto a pumpkin a few days before Halloween last year, and savvy fans </span><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8541502/lady-gaga-stupid-love-fan-theory-pumpkin\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discovered</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> her phone playing a track named “STUPID LOVE,” most likely a demo of the song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If that wasn’t enough to get people excited, the song </span><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2020/01/21/new-lady-gaga-song-stupid-love-leaks-her-fanbase-rejoices/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leaked in full</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Jan. 21 of this year. The leaked version and the official single are the same versions, stirring unease in fans who thought the leak might cause a poor commercial success. Leaks have impacted artists severely in the past, but it looks like Gaga’s fan base worked extra hard to promote the song. “Stupid Love Bucks,” a reference to the similar “</span><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/starbucks-shallow-lady-gaga-scam-shallowbucks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shallowbucks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” scam going on a year ago that tricked Starbucks customers into thinking they can get a free drink if they stream the song, is popping up in an effort to get the song to a higher chart placement on the Billboard Hot 100. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaga’s marketing team is working in overdrive as well, as she was on the cover of several notable playlists that “Stupid Love” was included on, like “</span><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M?si=nMThiu5jQda3emN7zEGfSg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today’s Top Hits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” (Spotify), “</span><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/new-music-daily/pl.2b0e6e332fdf4b7a91164da3162127b5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Music Daily</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and “</span><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/todays-hits/pl.f4d106fed2bd41149aaacabb233eb5eb\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today’s Hits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” (both Apple Music). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tactics might’ve worked because “Stupid Love” currently has 26 million views on YouTube. It’s also projected to </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/simmnfierzig/status/1235363999920816128?s=20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">debut in the top six</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Billboard Hot 100, which would out-perform “Perfect Illusion,” the lead single off of Joanne, which debuted and peaked at No. 15. If Gaga can maintain this momentum despite the song leaking, it’s all the more impressive considering her decade-long career in music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this strong comeback, I’m interested in seeing where Gaga goes on “Chromatica,” the 16-track record. Several theories have suspected each track might have to do with a specific color (“Stupid Love” being pink), based on Gaga’s recent endeavors in make-up palettes from </span><a href=\"https://www.hauslabs.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haus Laboratories</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a beauty store she launched in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Either way, Gaga has my stupid love, and I’ll be listening to “Chromatica” on April 10 as well as any other tracks she might release along the way.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.
