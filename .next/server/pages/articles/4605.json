A California Highway Patrol car was parked on the side of the street, but Waltman didn’t think twice about breezing through the intersection on his bicycle.</p>\n<p>“There were no cars on the road and it was 9 a.m.,” said Waltman, a UCSB alumnus. “I slowed down and didn’t stop. I’ve done that plenty of times in front of a cop.”</p>\n<p>Moments later, the patrol car’s lights flashed on and an officer cited Waltman for failing to stop — a $270 fine for the first offense, according to the Santa Barbara Police Department.</p>\n<p>“‘We are cracking down on it to hopefully make you guys more safe,’” Waltman recalled the officer saying. As Waltman pedaled away from the curb, he saw the officer pull over another bicyclist for running the same stop sign.</p>\n<p>While Waltman and other Isla Vistans say there has been an increase in citations for bike offenses, Officer John Gutierrez of the Santa Barbara Police Department said there is no effort by highway patrol officers to write more tickets.</p>\n<p>“We’re not told to go out there and write up bicyclists — not at all,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>The police department will be hosting a bike safety event on March 2 at the Pardall Center, after which, Gutierrez said, there may be a “ramped up increase” in citations.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez pointed to recent bike accidents in I.V., including a two-bike collision on Pardall Road <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/692109191822049280\">in January</a> that sent one person to the hospital, as evidence of the need for bicyclists to follow traffic signs.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are riding bicycles unsafely in I.V.,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night, Associated Students senators voted to send a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bike-Law-Resolution.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> resolution</a> to External Affairs Committee that calls on campus police, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office and California Highway Patrol “to allow bicycles to treat stop signs and red lights as yield signs.” The resolution will now head to A.S. External Affairs.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Jerel Constantino, who drafted the bill, said because so many students already ignore the bike laws, the bill is designed “to keep the status quo.”</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, third-year history of public policy major and College of Letters &amp; Sciences collegiate senator, said Isla Vista Foot Patrol regulates bicycle and skateboard laws inconsistently.</p>\n<p>“The crackdown on bicyclists is unreasonable, because I.V.F.P. will be very strict on biking rules . . . and then will disappear,” Minoiefar said. “I don’t think the crackdown is about safety, because the rules are not enforced consistently.”</p>\n<p>The resolution refers to a 1982 Idaho statute known as the “Idaho stop,” which allows bicyclists to roll through stop signs, after looking both ways, and to bike under red lights after stopping.</p>\n<p>“The Idaho stop is not saying you see a stop sign and you ignore it,” Constantino said. “When you see a stop sign, that should be a key to look both left and right and, if necessary, stop.”</p>\n<p>Constantino, third-year history of public policy and political science double major, said he bikes to campus from I.V. every day and drafted the bill to protect bicyclists “from a misguided prioritization of law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls for the California State Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown to institute a similar law statewide.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Waltman was cited, he posted a picture of his ticket on a popular UCSB Facebook group, warning other bicyclists that officers were enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, he was at the center of a spirited debate in the comment section about whether police should ticket bicyclists for failing to obey traffic signs.</p>\n<p>While some commenters assumed Waltman disagreed with being cited, he said he “totally deserved” the ticket.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s a little inconvenient to stop and go on a rusty old mountain bike, but when you have a culture where nobody stops and people just throw themselves into intersections, it’s dangerous,” Waltman said.</p>\n<p>Elena Rovito, fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she often bikes to class and to restaurants in I.V. Rovito said she always follows the traffic signs, but when she walks, she has to be aware of bicyclists who are not following the law.</p>\n<p>“You have to constantly be on your toes,” Rovito said. “You’ll see people biking, not looking both ways, texting, and I’ve had to jump out of the way on more than one occasion.”</p>\n<p>Sarah Garrett, first-year political science major and copy reader at the Daily Nexus, was ticketed recently for failing to stop at the corner of Camino Pescadero and Trigo Road. Garrett said she plans to enroll in a bike safety course to reduce her fine.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think anything of it because, a couple days before, I had blown through a stop sign by a cop and nothing had happened,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>The officer told Garrett that he was trying to keep her and other bicyclists safe, but she said stopping at some intersections can be more dangerous than passing slowly through.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be more of a hazard to stop at certain stop signs because no one is stopping and I feel like herds of bikes might run over me,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>Garrett now tries to avoid biking through I.V. by staying on El Colegio Road for as long as possible. When she has to bike through I.V., though, she said she stops at every stop sign to avoid another ticket — or at least slows down and puts her foot on the ground.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this story said the bike resolution had passed Student Senate. The bike resolution was revised and sent to External Affairs, passed, and sent back to Senate where it awaits final approval.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

In the meeting, students, long-term residents and representatives from the Santa Barbara County considered the possibility of creating an I.V. Code Enforcement Program allowing the CSD to enforce building and zoning codes in I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Deputy Director of Planning and Development Glenn Russell, the cost to expand the County’s current Code Enforcement Program would be approximately $235,000 a year, and it would cost an I.V. CSD about $20,000 to $25,000 to get the program started.</p>\n<p>“$235,000 is a reasonable estimate,” Russell said. “It could be a little bit more. It could be a little bit less.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee Jonathan Abboud said Russell’s estimate for the Code Enforcement Program is significantly larger than the $120,000 estimated in the Financial Analysis Study The Fund for Santa Barbara released in September 2015.</p>\n<p>“That sounds like a lot of money,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Russell, the current Code Enforcement Program only investigates building and zoning code violations if residents report them to the county.</p>\n<p>“What we have today is a reactive code enforcement program, both for building and zoning violations,” Russell said. “Anybody in Isla Vista who reports a building or zoning violation can have it investigated.”</p>\n<p>Russell said a “proactive” Code Enforcement Program — one where Program officials can exercise their police powers to bring residences up to code — would raise the possibility of evicting residents for zoning violations, which is the protocol for enforcing such codes.</p>\n<p>“Be careful what you wish for,” Russell said. “You have to be very judicious in how you apply these limited police powers. A proactive Code Enforcement Program would put people out of their lodging.”</p>\n<p>According to Field Representative for Assemblymember Das Williams’ office Cameron Schunk, the structure of an I.V. CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will largely depend upon the funding it receives from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be largely contingent on what we hear from UCSB as far as what they want to contribute towards what type of program they want to see,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said University administrators discussed the possibility of opening University housing to students the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program temporarily evicts as incentive to bring their residencies up to code.</p>\n<p>“There were talks amongst administrative officials about offering some of the University’s housing as kind of temporary assistance housing if we decided to pursue some sort of code enforcement to bring the housing stock of I.V. back up to an acceptable level,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>With this option, however, Schunk said there is a “hidden catch” that the evicted students’ landlord might decrease the number of bedrooms in the residence.</p>\n<p>“There’s no guarantee that you’re going to have a place to go back to,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>As a solution for assisting evicted residents, Abboud said he suggests the I.V. CSD create a temporary housing fund.</p>\n<p>“If the I.V. CSD did implement this, we could have a small fund to help people who got kicked out to find temporary relocation for a month until they could move back into their place once it’s up to code,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said she is concerned about the possibility of evicting I.V. residents for violating zoning codes, such as by living in a closet or a garage.</p>\n<p>“These sort of people are not living in those conditions because they want to. It is because they have no other resources,” Dela Cruz said. “I think it’s important for us to keep that in mind that there are larger reasons for why these issues are occurring in our community, and we need to think about that as well while we’re thinking about this program.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66897\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"128780311\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66919\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66897\" data-attachment-id=\"66897\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/stakeholders-discuss-code-enforcement-program/iv-stakeholders-121-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"IV Stakeholders discussing the current county coe enforcement, and what would happen if we were switched to proactive enforcement.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1448996545\",\"copyright\":\"John Clow\\/DN\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"IV Stakeholders 12\\/1\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Stakeholders 12/1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66897\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66897\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Russell, however, a Code Enforcement Program cannot ignore violations for the sake of avoiding the eviction of residents, as it must be consistent in enforcing violations.</p>\n<p>“You can’t ignore something someplace because you just feel bad,” Russell said. “You have to be absolutely consistent and even-handed.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said she hopes the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will provide opportunities for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in hearing about the students and the involvement we may have in this Code Enforcement Program,” Dela Cruz said. “This is something that I think the university is very interested in. How is it that students can get involved with this?”</p>\n<p>Russell said a Code Enforcement Program will be “very important,” because fixing small building issues can have a positive effect on the way people feel about their community.</p>\n<p>“The goal of code enforcement is to get compliance with the building and zoning code, which is supposed to preserve the harmony of the community or at least contribute to the harmony of the community,” Russell said.</p>\n<p>Community Organizer for Williams’ office Darcel Elliot said implementing a Code Enforcement Program in I.V.’s CSD is one of the more “complicated” services, which is why the Initiative chose not to discuss it earlier.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They say students will be able to celebrate the students’ lives rather than solely grieving their deaths.</p>\n<p>“This year we just wanted to really again create the same feeling again of unity but also make sure it has a positive spin to it,” said fourth-year communication and art double major Raphaella Faria. “That’s how we decided to create a live carnival and integrate everyone, students, community members.”</p>\n<p>Faria, who helped start Blunite in 2015 with a fellow student and art professor Kim Yasuda, hopes that students can enjoy the prizes, photo booth and crafts while understanding the deeper meaning of the lights.</p>\n<p>“People can expect to have lots of fun, to see lots of lights,” Faria said. “We really wanted to focus on using the LED lights as our symbol.”</p>\n<p>Several I.V. businesses have joined the cause as well, with Otaco, Hana Kitchen and Sorriso Italiano, among others, displaying blue lights. IV Drip created a Blunite cookie and Woodstock’s Pizza will be selling blue beer.</p>\n<p>Faria, who was at UCSB at the time of the shooting, said students must remember that families in I.V. remain even while thousands of students leave each year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70971\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70971\" data-attachment-id=\"70971\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-14/blue-lights-in-peoples-park-to-mark-anniversary-of-tragedy/blunite-prep-jenny-luo-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Blunite Prep\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70971\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=368%2C245\" alt=\"People's Park will be glowing Saturday night as attendees can expect carnival games, prizes and lives DJs.
