Environmental concerns, particularly coastal conservation efforts, dominated her presentation, as Farr said biodiversity of the coastland contains great value.</p>\n<p>“Because of all the coastline that I have, all the coastal protection issues are of utmost importance,” Farr said. “This particular stretch of coastline has some of the highest biodiversity on the planet.”</p>\n<p>Farr said Santa Barbara County’s efforts to move away from fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy has been a prominent effort that she and members of her office “all take very seriously.”</p>\n<p>“I feel very strongly, as do several of my colleagues, that moving our county and our society toward a more sustainable future, looking at our consumption of fossil fuels and how we transition to more sustainable energy sources is something that’s extremely important, and I think that Santa Barbara County has been a model in many ways of forward thinking on environmental issues,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Farr said she is currently working to put together the I.V. community center, which she believes will be a vital addition to the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>“It’s not an easy fight, but we’ve come this far and we’re optimistic that it will happen,” Farr said. “Having a community center in I.V. is huge and this is something that’s been going on for a long time. I’d really like to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Collegiate Senator Amir Khazaieli reported on the current progress in receiving funding for the I.V. Pardall space.</p>\n<p>“We do have money now to continue the improvement that y’all as an association and a student body have requested in the last quarter and a half,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Corey Lau, however, showed skepticism toward the community center, asking Senator Khazaieli to justify the expenditure.</p>\n<p>“I’m still apprehensive of the very existence of the Pardall Center, because as far as I know, I’m not so sure that’s a necessary thing,” Lau said. “I want to hear your argument as to why do we need the Pardall Center.”In response, Khazaieli said the center is designed to address various shortcomings within I.V., such as a lack in a connected sense of community.</p>\n<p>“There’s frankly no community and/ or student presence in I.V. right now, especially from the Association,” Khazaieli said. “Having something on Pardall Road … an area where everyone passes will one, incredibly increase[s] transparency and outreach of our association … and will allow us to reach more people with our events, our tabling, our forums — with everything that we do. So I think that it’s a very valid, very needed space.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s veto of a bill passed by the Senate regarding the implementation of a new logo for A.S. was upheld after a lengthy debate amongst the Senators, delaying any possibility of implementing changes to the existing logo.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed plans for the upcoming Chilla Vista concert, the expected budget of which totals to roughly $17,500. Senators spoke on the goal of putting primarily local bands into focus for the concert and noted that this year’s planned expenditure is lower than last year’s. The unspent funds were instead diverted toward the I.V. Pardall space.</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included plans to increase lighting on dark streets in I.V., the fumigation of the Thunderdome, hiring of a new A.S. administrative personnel, planned renovations to the UCen under the S.U.R.F. Initiative and the efforts to provide more worm compost bins around campus to reduce food waste.</p>\n<p>Later at the meeting, Lundberg was sworn as Senator to replace Senator Marvin Ramirez, who resigned for personal reasons.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53902\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53902\" data-attachment-id=\"53902\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/a-s-senate-discusses-energy-debates-i-v-center-logo/as_senate_johnclow_02-05-2014-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1391632970\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53902\" alt=\"Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr attended last night’s A.S. meeting to present on current office projects regarding the student community.\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS_Senate_JohnClow_02.05.2014-15.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-53902\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr attended last night’s A.S. meeting to present on current office projects regarding the student community.</p></div>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, February 6, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate last week, claiming that the process of establishing the logo was not “inclusive” enough of the student body.</p>\n<p>The logo was part of a resolution authored by senators Ali Guthy and Beatrice Contreras that established both an official A.S. logo and an official Senate logo in order to “increase the overall visibility of the association.” However, Abboud sent out a press release on Saturday announcing his veto decision, specifying that the process of passing the logo contained “a lack of inclusive decision-making.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Abboud said A.S. is “in need of a major image upgrade stylistically,” but “all who participate in the activities of Associated Students” should be able to take part in the process of that upgrade. He urged the Senate to publicly solicit contributions for logo ideas and then encourage all “A.S. entities to make their opinions known.”</p>\n<p>The logo issue hit close to home for Abboud, as he said all students should be able to be a part of the incredible projects and events of A.S.</p>\n<p>“I believe each and every person in A.S. and even the student body should have had a chance to submit designs and submit their opinion,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<p>Contreras said that while she understands the president’s rationale, she hopes the matter will be resolved quickly, as the Senate has already devoted ample time to the deliberation.</p>\n<p>“President Abboud said that he wasn’t comfortable with the outreach efforts, and I feel that this was a reasonable argument,” Contreras said. “But the Senate had been deliberating on the logo for weeks and very few people voiced concerns, so it didn’t seem like anyone was openly opposed to the change.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53899\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53899\" data-attachment-id=\"53899\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/new-a-s-logo-is-a-no-go-a-s-president-rejects-design/logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53899\" alt=\"Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-53899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.</p></div>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Associated Students of UCSB.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, February 6, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

One significant difference between the two parties lies in how each decides on the yearly slate, with DP choosing its slate through an open primary and OPP through an interview process.</p>\n<p>As for their mission statements, the parties differ only slightly. DP stated on its Facebook event page for its informational sessions that the party’s primary goal is to “challenge the status quo” of A.S. by demanding that the student government become more “Associated with YOU” as an inclusive group for all students, as opposed to remaining “exclusive to a privileged few.” OPP also professed inclusivity, claiming on their own Facebook event page that they value the “honest and absolute representation of each and every student” at UCSB.</p>\n<p>OPP will hold its last informational session tonight from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m at the San Nicolas Classroom.

Local student DJs were judged by a checklist system based on mixing ability, song selection, originality, energy and audience response. The four DJs with the highest scores — Beta wave, PsychoJohn, T-Fresh and Dropwise — will move on to the next round at tonight’s final competition at the Hub.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Program Board publicity coordinator Karen Masumoto, third-year communication and film &amp; media studies major, Battle of the DJs is a new incarnation of the annual Program Board event Battle of the Bands, which also aims to spotlight local student talent.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to do something new,” Masumoto said. “We always have transitions during Extravaganza when there’s no music playing, so we thought that during that time we could really use DJs. And we kind of wanted to spotlight all the DJs in Isla Vista since there’s so many house parties that have talented DJs.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Speak Volumes editor-in-chief Dylan Chase — who is one member of DJ duo PsychoJohn — said the event allowed electronic music artists across “a whole gradient” to display their different brands of talent, utilizing different techniques ranging from controllers to vinyl to CDs to live mixing.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to show that DJing is a craft and that there are varying levels,” Chase said. “We try to incorporate different stuff into our routine. We do live performance and play vinyl records.”</p>\n<p>Describing their music as a “dreamy and ephemeral kind of house vibe” that ranges from “soul and funk music,” Chase and his DJ partner — third-year film &amp; media studies major Alex Ho — have already played shows at I.V. Theatre, Indochine and SoHo in addition to last night’s performance at the Hub. According to Chase, he and Ho “like to play that funky shit.”</p>\n<p>Tyler Fish, a fourth-year communication major who goes by the DJ name T-Fresh, described his music as “bouncy and highly energetic” and he said the roots of his DJ career go back to his freshman year during Deltopia, which he described as “pretty fucking legendary.”</p>\n<p>“I was a drummer all my life and I was in numerous bands … then I realized that bands aren’t playing backyards on DP — it’s DJs,” Fish said. “So I picked up my first pair of turn tables, sold my drum set and got some speakers.”</p>\n<p>Chemistry graduate student Matthew Snedaker, a.k.a. DJanet Napolitano, said his influences are rooted in hip hop and that his DJ name is derived from his views on the UC President.</p>\n<p>“I really like Janet Napolitano as a person. I think it’s really important to have a woman in this position,” Snedacker said, “But you have to also consider that she’s a politician and she’s making an absurd amount of money when she should be a public servant, and that bothers me a lot.”</p>\n<p>Third-year film &amp;
