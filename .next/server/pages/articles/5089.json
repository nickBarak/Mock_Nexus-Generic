Just to play as hard as we can and have fun.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will end its season on the road, facing UC Irvine next Tuesday. After being swept by Hawaii, the Anteaters are 12-14 overall, 6-8 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began its conference schedule against Hawaii which resulted in a 3-0 sweep of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With its sweep of UC Irvine on Tuesday, the Rainbow Wahine clinched the Big West Conference title outright. Hawaii is currently the only Big West team with an undefeated conference record at 13-0 and is 23-1 overall.</p>\n<p>Its third conference title in the past four years, Hawaii earned its eighth Big West and 24th overall conference title. Since its 3-1 loss to No. 11 UCLA on Sept. 6, Hawaii has been the epitome of a championship caliber team. The Rainbow Wahine currently possess a 18-match winning streak, their longest since winning 19 straight in 2012.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s success this season is no coincidence as it has been one of the best defensive teams in the country. The Rainbow Wahine led the nation in blocks per set with a 3.37 average. Continuously stifling offenses, Hawaii’s .143 opponent hitting percentage ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>With statistical rankings atop the nation, it’s no coincidence that Hawaii has dominated nearly every statistical category within the Big West.</p>\n<p>Conference leads in hitting percentage (.287), blocks (3.37), kills per set (14.05), service aces per set (1.52) and opponent hitting percentage (.143). A total of three Hawaii players rank within the top five statistical leaders in hitting percentage, blocks per set and services aces per set.</p>\n<p>While no team revolves around one individual, junior opposite Nikki Taylor has been the Rainbow Wahine’s best player.</p>\n<p>The fourth player in Hawaii history to earn four Big West Player of the Week honors, the reigning conference Offensive Player of the Week has registered at least 20 kills in three of the team’s last four matches. Her averages of 4.36 kills per set and 0.44 service aces per set lead the conference while she ranks third in blocks per set with a 1.24 average.</p>\n<p>Although the odds do not favor UCSB, the combination of playing on its home court and motivation from the occasion give the Gauchos a chance to compete versus the Big West’s best.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be aggressive,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’re going to have a big size disadvantage against Hawaii but we still have to find a way to use that to our advantage. Making sure that we get our hands on the block and that there’s no tentativeness in our play.”</p>\n<p>Helping establish UCSB’s aggressiveness is freshman libero Emilia Petrachi. Due to UCSB’s lack of size, the Gauchos’ front row defense may not earn many blocks, leaving many dig opportunities for Petrachi. She recently earned her second Big West Freshman of the Week award after 20-plus back-to-back dig performances last weekend.</p>\n<p>Another chance to avenge a loss in the first meeting presents itself in the Gauchos’ rematch against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite Santa Barbara tying the match 1-1 after two sets, the Anteaters managed to earn a 3-1 victory. Close finishes in the final two sets, back-to-back 25-23 set victories, allowed UCI to edge UCSB for the win.</p>\n<p>“The Irvine match was very recent,” Lantagne Welch said. “We had three two-point sets with them. All we needed was a point here and a point there, and that match is a different story.”</p>\n<p>It was expected that freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha, the team’s leader in kills (318), would be the leading force in Irvine’s attack against the Gauchos. However, redshirt senior outside hitter Marisa Bubica carried the Anteaters to victory with a match-high 19 kills and finished with a .341 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Wins to end the season would be an encouraging finish for a team that has struggled to meet its expectations. But as the collegiate careers of five seniors come to an end, the journey of the players is most rewarding.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big deal,” Lantagne Welch said. “Seniors grow and progress throughout their careers. It’s a special moment, seeing them come along not only as volleyball players but people.”</p>\n<p>The Senior Night matchup versus Hawaii will begin at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 21 in the Thunderdome. UCSB’s last match of the season on Tuesday, Nov. 24 at UC Irvine will start at 7:00 p.m. and will be played at Crawford Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66605\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66605\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-searching-for-upset-of-no-8-hawaii-on-senior-night-will-face-uci-to-close-season/","id":5089,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5088,5087,5086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 16 UCSB Opens Season at Winter Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6-peter-vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6-peter-vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB opened the season with a 2-5 record at the UCSB Winter Invitational this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Kicking its season off as the hosts for the UCSB Winter Invite, the No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team began its year with a 2-5 start this past weekend.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos’ solid start to the year quickly turned into a tough five game losing streak, their opening weekend finale against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps proved to be their best performance thus far.

After the Bears got out to a quick 4-0 lead after the first quarter, sophomore utility Samantha Murphy scored the Gauchos’ first goal of the game to cut the lead to three. However, the Bears answered back with four more consecutive goals heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>Going into the third quarter with a large deficit, sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson gave the Gauchos their second goal of the match. Cal answered with three goals of its own, taking a dominant 11-2 lead into the final period. Junior utility Lauren Martin was one of the few bright spots for UCSB during the game, scoring two goals in the fourth quarter, but the Gauchos were outplayed once again and finally fell 14-4.</p>\n<p>Playing No. 5 Arizona State early on Saturday, Santa Barbara came out strong with Martin scoring the game’s opening goal. The Sun Devils answered with three goals of their own, but freshman attacker Carly Christian scored two straight before the end of the first period, making it a one-goal deficit at 4-3 heading into the second.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos again started the second quarter strong as Hudson scored first to tie it at four goals apiece, but Arizona State began to pull away with another three consecutive scores heading into the half.</p>\n<p>In the second half, UCSB found goals from freshman attacker Jenna Solberg and Murphy, but the team was unable to pull off the comeback and lost 11-6 for its second-straight loss.</p>\n<p>Against No. 8 San Jose State Friday afternoon, the Gauchos’ offense got off to a slow start. UCSB was shutout in the first quarter but its strong defense kept them in the game by giving up only one goal.</p>\n<p>Just after the second quarter began, Hudson tied the game at 1-1. As they did multiple times over the weekend, though, the Gauchos gave up three consecutive goals to the Spartans and went into the half trailing 4-1.</p>\n<p>To have any shot at coming back, UCSB needed a big second half, and it got one. Martin scored two goals, including one coming off of a set, and Christian added another to give the Gauchos three in the quarter and head into the fourth trailing 6-4.</p>\n<p>In a tightly contested fourth quarter, UCSB took the game down to the wire. Hudson scored her second goal, and Martin scored two more to bring her total to four on the day. Still trailing 8-7, Christian tied the game.</p>\n<p>However, with just 1:11 remaining, San Jose State was able to beat sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw and come away with a 9-8 victory. Brokaw ended the game with eight saves.</p>\n<p>In their first game of the season, the Gauchos were brought down to earth quickly as they gave up a goal just 15 seconds into the match. Sophomore utility Jessie Porter answered back to tie it at one and Christian scored her first career goal to give her team the lead.</p>\n<p>Before the end of the half, Christian contributed her second goal of the match while sophomore utility Michelle Dunn and freshman utility Megan Linder also scored to give UCSB a 5-3 lead at the half. In the third, Martin scored once more to make it 6-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to hold on in a low-scoring fourth quarter, ending the game with a 7-6 win and their first of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB gets next weekend off before heading on the road for the UCSD Triton Invite on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/","id":5086,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5085,5084,5083],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes 2-2 at UCSD Triton Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/womens-water-polo_for-02.10_Peter-Vandenbelt-4-of-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/womens-water-polo_for-02.10_Peter-Vandenbelt-4-of-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Over the weekend in San Diego, the Gauchos defeated Marist and San Diego State but fell to Loyola Marymount and UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After getting off to a rough start to the season, the No. 18 UCSB women’s water polo team went into the UCSD Triton Invite hungry for wins.

On the right wing of the court at the other opposite position is senior Britton Taylor, who recorded 10 kills. At the net, junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield emerged for stellar hitting nights as Grunt earned 13 kills and Sheffield ended with 11.</p>\n<p>The catalysts for UCSB’s success on offense were both setters, senior Hanna Nielson and freshman Annie Hasselmann. Nielson finished with a match-high 30 kills while Hasselmann had 21 on the night.

UCSB loss in straight sets by scores of 15-25, 23-25, and 21-25.</p>\n<p>The victory over the Titans ended UCSB’s five-match losing streak heading into the weekend, but Saturday’s outcome added another loss to the Gauchos’ records of 7-18 overall and 3-11 in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton continues to plummet after Friday’s loss and being swept by Cal Poly on Saturday. The Titans sit at 0-26 overall, 0-14 in conference matches, matching their second worst start in program history.</p>\n<p>However, it was a historic ending to the weekend for the Highlanders as they broke a program record for conference wins, earning their fifth in the sweep of UCSB. The 3-0 victory was the team’s second sweep of the season, creating another UCR record.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s quick start to open the match against CSUF led to it maintaining the lead throughout the entirety of the first set. An early 4-0 scoring run handed the Gauchos an 8-3 lead but would be trimmed as the Titans answered back with a 4-1 run of their own to pull within two at 7-9.</p>\n<p>Having the best season in her collegiate career, Grunt’s surge of three consecutive kills helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 13-7. Her 13 kills matched a season-high in attacks to go along with a .346 hitting clip. Grunt was the only Gaucho to record a solo block.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the first set with a .368 hitting percentage, holding Fullerton to a .135 clip for the 25-15 victory and 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Fullerton slowed down UCSB’s attack to a .286 hitting percentage in the second set and took an early 5-2 lead. But the Titans’ short stint of scores did not last long as they could not surpass the Gauchos’ defensive prowess.</p>\n<p>In addition to CSUF’s six errors, Santa Barbara allowed just seven kills to hold the Titans to a .028 hitting percentage. The Gauchos’ 76 digs were their second-most in a match this season. Leading UCSB in defensive scoops was freshman libero Emilia Petrachi with a match-high 26.</p>\n<p>Exchanges of scoring runs between the two teams resulted in Fullerton taking a 13-10 lead, ensuing a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the timeout was a reinvigorated Santa Barbara team as it achieved a 4-0 scoring rally of its own to force a CSUF timeout. But the Gauchos’ dominance persisted, extending into an 11-1 run that put them up 21-14 and eventually led to a 25-19 set victory.</p>\n<p>Five of Grunt’s 13 kills appeared during the set while UCSB notched four of its nine service aces as well, the total being its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>CSUF countered with an outstanding .448 hitting percentage in the third set. Most notably, Fullerton never trailed as it had 13 kills and zero errors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Katelyn Nielsen provided the spark to the Titans’ 16-5 run, tallying an individual 5-1 scoring run. She finished with a career-high 13 kills and helped lead Fullerton to its 25-14 win to cut the Gauchos’ lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>But Nielsen’s breakout performance was not enough to prevent UCSB from taking a 25-17 win in the final set for the 3-1 victory. UCSB’s .371 hitting percentage to end the match was its highest for the evening. Another four aces would appear as Sheffield had a match-high three.</p>\n<p>While neither team hit over a .300 clip in any set of Saturday’s match, UC Riverside’s offense was just enough to edge UCSB, specifically in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Villanueva registered another double digit hitting performance with 12 kills but was outperformed by the excellent attack of UCR’s senior outside hitter Helena Peric. She recorded a match-high 18 kills for the fourth time this season to lead Riverside to its 3-0 sweep of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Hawai’i next Saturday, Nov. 14<sup>th</sup> in its last home match of the season. It will also be the team’s senior night in which five players will be honored.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/","id":5088,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5087,5086,5085],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
