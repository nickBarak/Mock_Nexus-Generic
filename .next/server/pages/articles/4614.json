At Friday’s event, representatives discussed conditions in North Korea, the challenges of escaping the country and how the organization aids refugees.</p>\n<p>LINK member John Park said North Koreans are “just like you and me” but come from very different circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There’s 24 million people in North Korea, full of hopes, dreams, families and relationships,” Park said. “The only difference is between here and there; they are living in one of the most suppressive countries in this world today.”</p>\n<p>Park said the Kim dynasty has convinced North Korean citizens of a “different reality.”</p>\n<p>“They tell them that the outside world is full of stress and enemies and they have to put their faith in their leaders,” Park said. “Their regime puts forth incredible time and resources to make people believe in their strict version of socialism.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, the North Korean government controls its citizens through censorship and isolation.<br>\n“To prevent their people from seeing the outside world, North Korea has an information and media blockade,” Park said. “They cannot make international phone calls, they are banned from foreign radio or watching foreign television.”</p>\n<p>Park said there is little resistance to the Kim dynasty’s rule because of the severe penalties in place for dissonance.</p>\n<p>“If you are suspected of defying the regime, they conduct harsh interrogation with you and your entire family and may place you in a political prison camp,” Park said. “The estimated number is 80 to 120 thousand people kept in these prisons, including entire families. We’ve heard the regime uses torture, starvation, and even execution in order to keep people in line.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, thousands of North Koreans have escaped to China since the 1990s as a form of “quiet disobedience.”</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the direct travel to South Korea is blocked by the DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone, so thousands of North Koreans travel to China,” Park said. “But even if they make it to China, the Chinese government does not recognize North Koreans as refugees.”</p>\n<p>Park said if refugees are caught by the Chinese government, they are deported to North Korea where they may face forced labor and torture.</p>\n<p>“If they get caught, they will be sent back, and there, they will be faced with grave punishments for leaving the government,” Park said.</p>\n<p>North Korean refugee Min Sung said the challenges and potential consequences refugees face are better than continuing to live in suppression.</p>\n<p>“You only live on Earth once; I want to live it in freedom,” Sung said.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member and second-year undeclared major Athena Wan said she hopes people who attended the event will support LINK in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to bring this organization to my campus, and I finally did it in college because I feel like it’s a really good organization and, like, they have a really great cause,” Athena said. “Since we have the materials to help them with, I feel like we should all try to participate. I hope this event spreads awareness on their cause and their organization.”</p>\n<p>KASA member and third-year sociology major Samantha Chang said she applauds LINK’s mission.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad to see a group is doing something to potentially be political but doing it for the people,” Chang said. “I feel like it’s hard to convey a non-political stance these days. So their efforts to resettle North Korean refugees is really amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year anthropology major Connie Kim said the event helped her further understand the challenges North Koreans face.</p>\n<p>“I just knew that it was hard living in North Korea and they didn’t have rights, but I feel more informed,” Kim said.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Peter Dang said although the issues discussed at the event are geographically distant, the UCSB community should participate in a solution.</p>\n<p>“We can still make a difference and be able to make life better for people that we will never meet and for a cause that is important to those people,” Dang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

By the end of the evening, the surfaces of the paper lanterns were covered with pictures, songs and simple words such as “I.V. Strong.”</p>\n<p>The memorial events were smaller this year than last, allowing students to address the anniversary and heal in personal ways.</p>\n<p>“I think people just want a space — a space to heal and space to just do whatever they want that is going to benefit them the best — rather than having an organized official event,” Madeline Berger, third-year art and theater double major and student leader for the “Blunite” memorial, said.</p>\n<p>She said the canvases celebrated the life of each student and allowed visitors to acknowledge loss, even if they did not personally know the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think having dedicated spaces like the canvases really do make it a little more connected to each individual that we lost, but … there is no reason you have to connect yourself to exactly one victim,” Berger said. “There [were] tons of people that got hurt, got injured, got shot but recovered … but it was still a part of our community and it still happened to them.”</p>\n<p>Berger described the media attention from last year’s memorial as “overwhelming” and said this year’s gathering was just as special. She believes future anniversaries will be more “private and personal” as the community learns to heal over the passing years.</p>\n<p>“I think that a lot of the feelings that I’ve been getting from people are just, ‘I need to be able to express it however I am going to express it,’” Berger said. “There doesn’t need to be something big or grand … it can be something as simple as making tea light bags.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/","id":4611,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4610,4609,4608],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"La Escuelita and IVRPD Host Safe Halloween Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Safe-Halloween-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Safe-Halloween-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Campus organization La Escuelita and Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) hosted Safe Halloween Saturday at Children’s Park.

More than a dozen organizations collaborated to put on the event with activities like face painting, bounce house and Halloween-themed games.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year math and Spanish double major Sonia Acuna said the annual event provides a fun and safe place for local children to enjoy Halloween.</p>\n<p>“It’s a tradition to have it every year, to have a safe space for children to come play and celebrate Halloween,” Acuna said. “Obviously, in Isla Vista it isn’t always the best place to go trick-or-treating on Halloween night, so we try to bring it to them even though it’s the weekend before.”</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year statistics major Jose Neri said students often forget there are many families who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Halloween in I.V. is very party-like, and it’s not a very ideal place for kids to go trick-or-treating,” Neri said. “Also, most students here don’t have candy to give out to little kids, so that’s why we do this for the little kids.”</p>\n<p>Acuna said Safe Halloween is made possible through the support of local organizations.</p>\n<p>“We invited them all to have a booth or little activity for the kids to play and have fun,” Acuna said. “It’s really awesome to have them here. There’s about 15 or 16 orgs here right now… it fills up the park and it feels nice to have their support here.”</p>\n<p>Lambda Theta Alpha member and third-year Chican@ studies major Cristina Cota said she and her sorority sisters were “excited to participate” in Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really great opportunity for children who don’t really have access to the typical Halloween trick-or-treating experience in their neighborhood that you would see on T.V. or that you grow up with in a hometown,” Cota said.</p>\n<p>Acuna said IVRPD, Community Affairs Board (CAB), and Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) contributed funds to Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“[IVRPD] covered a fee of about almost $300,” Acuna said. “We’re here because they helped us with that. I know CAB is donating money as well and IVCRC is also donating money, so this is possible with a lot of help from IVRPD, CAB and IVCRC.”</p>\n<p>Cota said it is important for students to be involved in I.V. community events like Safe Halloween during their time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for the community of Isla Vista because it shows that there’s a whole different side to us,” Cota said. “It’s really important for us to really nurture that and make sure that they get the best experience that they can, and it’s not just about coming here just to go to school, it’s also about giving back to the community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65772\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65772\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/","id":4612,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[4611,4610,4609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building for community members to discuss benefits and disadvantages of various self-governance options for I.V.</p>\n<p>Students, I.V. residents, government representatives and other stakeholders weighed the options of cityhood, a Community Service District (CSD) and a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and Area Planning Commission (APC), taking the recently released Isla Vista Governance Options Financial Analysis Study into consideration. The majority of the discussion centered on the possibility of creating both a CSD, through Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), and a MAC.</p>\n<p>AB 3 will become law Jan. 1, allowing for the creation of a CSD in I.V. if it is approved by potential residents in the November 2016 election. If approved, the CSD will be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which will tax residents five to eight percent of their utility bills.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, cityhood requires “high taxation,” while a CSD would impose a more reasonable rate.</p>\n<p>“In order to meet the levels that we would need to fund the city, we would have to run the highest UUT and also find some other taxes,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>While the CSD formation requires approval from only 50 percent of voters, the UUT requires a two thirds vote. I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and long-time I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she is concerned I.V. could potentially have an unfunded CSD.</p>\n<p>“We may end up with a CSD and a board but no funding mechanism,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Asian American studies and political science double-major Akshaya Natarajan said a CSD could create jobs for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“Potentially, a funded CSD could also fund student work,” Natarajan said. “There are people looking for part-time jobs that could also benefit.”</p>\n<p>MAC formation will require approval from the County Board of Supervisors, so many attendees of the meeting suggested I.V. attempt to create a MAC before November 2016 to begin the self-governance process before Third District County Supervisor and I.V. advocate Doreen Farr’s term ends in December.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Associated Students Lobby Corps director and fourth-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez, a MAC and CSD could function together to govern I.V.</p>\n<p>“If you have an AB 3-style CSD we would be allowed to have a MAC within that,” Lopez said. “They’re not mutually exclusive choices.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Downtown Business Association Vice President Jay Freeman, a MAC would hold general purpose meetings and advise the county on various I.V. issues, at less cost than a city or CSD.</p>\n<p>“We get almost all of the benefit for almost none of the cost by going with the Municipal Advisory Council or Advisory Planning Commission,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while a CSD is more expensive, the benefits of hiring staff to manage I.V. are important.</p>\n<p>“When you say administration is a cost, it’s not really a cost, it’s a positive,” Abboud said. “A person is very valuable. They can help organize people and they can provide information. Right now we don’t have that one person that Isla Vista pays to take care of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Meeting attendees also discussed UCSB’s involvement in I.V. governance. Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said by buying properties such as Tropicana Student Housing, the university helps provide affordable housing for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We don’t need to make a profit on it,” Thurlow said. “The hopeful part is that we can create a market situation where it is harder for other landlords to gouge students.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65676\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65676\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/","id":4613,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[4612,4611,4610],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
