Traditionally, women are expected to be groomed, cleaned, styled, primped and prepared from eyelash to toenail. Consider women’s hairstyles alone: there’s the length, color, style and occasional accessory. Ladies will spend countless hours in front of the damned 360-degree full-length mirror, perfecting their reflections until they feel like someone off the latest cover of <em>Vogue</em> … and that’s just for a quick trip to the DLG. Obviously, this is an exaggeration, but the clothes we wear, the makeup we put on and what perfume we use are all factors that are being analyzed each time we leave the house.</p>\n<p>Although the basic standards for guys are much less demanding, many still struggle with taking the deceptively simple steps necessary to get laid. Generally speaking, men have a much shorter list of things they have to do to get a partner’s attention, but that doesn’t mean that these few things aren’t just as vital. For the guys who have either mastered the outdoorsy vibe that drives some people wild, have guitars strapped to their backs or drive Bugattis, water through the hair and the occasional shave will suffice. However, for the remaining 99.99% of men, there are certain prerequisites that must be fulfilled before anyone will seriously consider you for their favorite position.</p>\n<p>So here is a starter’s guide for those of you who don’t know the difference between shampoo and conditioner – there is one, by the way. You guys can thank me later, when someone, if not a plethora of someones, is suddenly dying to hop into your (hopefully clean) sheets.<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"42693919\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51719\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51722\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/the-hurdles-to-jump-before-you-hump/new-image/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?fit=800%2C574&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,574\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"New Image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?fit=800%2C574&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51722\" alt=\"New Image\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image-250x179.jpg?resize=250%2C179\" width=\"250\" height=\"179\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

It’s as basic as asking a store clerk, “Hey, do these fit?” Pick something simple that works for you; less is almost always more. I know the end goal is to get someone in your pants, but if you can literally fit them inside while still wearing said pants, it might be time to go for a slimmer fit. That being said, make sure your jeans aren’t so tight that they cut off circulation to the parts that need it most – find a happy medium so you can make your medium happy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Clean Up, So You Can Clean Up</p>\n<p>Basic rule of thumb: If your grandmother wouldn’t approve of your living conditions, chances are, neither will your partner. Do the dishes, pick up your dirty clothes (or at least hide them well), hell, maybe you could even do your laundry. Basically, if your place is so dirty that you don’t want to be there, what makes you think that your partner is going to feel any different?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Do the ’Do or Chop the Mop</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much time to throw some type of product in your hair to at least make it look like you tried. With great hair comes great responsibility. And if you simply can’t muster up the energy to show it the respect it deserves, throw on a tasteful hat (three-gallon maximum). If long hair is too much of a commitment and you just can’t find the right hat, don’t be afraid to get your buzz on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If I Can Taste It, It’s Too Much</p>\n<p>Once the previous steps have helped you get a date, don’t expect that the smell of your Irish Spring bar soap is going to wow them into your arms. Using soap is a great start, don’t get me wrong, but once you’re out of the shower, a spray or two of something that doesn’t come in a can will definitely give you an advantage. Ditch the Axe and invest in a glass bottle. But make it last – use sparingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Be Minty Fresh</p>\n<p>Few things are more disappointing than getting excited and intimate, only to inhale your partner’s dinner breath. No one wants sloppy seconds from your egg salad sandwich. Brush your teeth, eat a mint, chew some gum or use mouthwash … we really don’t care. Keep your dinner a mystery and you just might get dessert.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chivalry: Back with a Vengeance</p>\n<p>Okay, so it’s old-fashioned, but everyone loves a knight in shining armor. Hold the door open, offer up your jacket on those cold nights, give a compliment here and there and remember that the occasional bouquet of flowers never hurt anybody. Go the extra mile so that they will too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If these ideas sound scary or revolutionary, you’re probably the guy who has the most to learn from them. These are pretty simple concepts and although there’s never a guarantee that you’re going to get some, I can just about promise you that if you neglect to follow these steps, the odds will never be in your favor.</p>\n<p><em>Haley K. never leaves the house without a fresh mani/pedi, a double coat of lip gloss, the perfect balance of bronzer and blush, and exactly seven spritzes of Daisy by Marc Jacobs. </em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of the June 26, 2013 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

You may be lying blissfully in bed when your partner of x-months asks you timidly, “So, are we exclusive?” Don’t panic. Don’t push them away. Don’t think, “God, there’s the end of a good thing.” I am all for being casual, if that’s what you want. And I absolutely agree that labels can be harmful to your relationship if they are forced or both members aren’t prepared for them. But labels are not something to overreact about. Rather, they are something that should be earnestly considered. You all have your varying notions on reasons for shunning or embracing labels and I’m going to address them as best I can. Sit tight.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, labels provide parameters and a good gauge of emotional investment. So often, people remain tight-lipped about what they’re actually feeling. It’s like a competition for who can be the most casual, or care the least. So, it’s ridiculously difficult to gauge whether or not your partner is taking you seriously or really likes you. Thus, the importance of labels. Bear with me.</p>\n<p>The talks you have with your partner will vary depending upon your relationship. I personally cannot stand the idea of dating someone for six months and having them still be only your “hookup buddy.” That’s half a year. That’s bullshit. If that’s all they’re keeping you for, they are not taking you seriously. And maybe you’re okay with that, and you want to keep it there. But if you’re emotionally attached, you need to prioritize what you want out of the relationship. I had to watch my friend put her partner’s feelings over her own for months. She wanted to be this relaxed, casual girl for him and, in doing so, she refused to tell him what she actually wanted. If you want something, tell them. Your partner is not a mind reader. When I was three weeks or so into dating my boyfriend, I asked him whether he considered our relationship casual or if he saw it going anywhere. If he said casual, that would have been a bummer, but at least I would have known and I would have been able to behave appropriately. That is the preliminary label you need to jump over. Know what they want out of your relationship so you don’t moon over them pointlessly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Later comes the exclusive/girlfriend line dance. After a loud and heated debate with a pack of dudes, I think I have a fair idea of the struggle between these terms. When deciding whether to remain exclusive or making their partner a girlfriend, the guys saw it as a pointless transition. It wouldn’t change anything; they already considered their partners at the level of girlfriend and didn’t understand the difference in connotation. However, the way I view it is like this: a girl you’re exclusive with is certainly close to girlfriend status. But being a girlfriend signifies that you are ready to open yourself up emotionally. Exclusive means you don’t have to worry about whether they’re dipping their chip into someone else’s dip or not. But girlfriend means that they’ll tell you about their childhood, their disappointments, their secrets and the extent of their feelings for you. It’s taking the next emotional step. And if there really is no difference, what’s holding you back from just saying it? If nothing really changes, what’s the problem? It will make them happier and there is the opportunity for more emotional satisfaction. I’m not the kind of person who will wait around months just to be a slam piece, and neither should you. Take yourself seriously and tell others what you want from your romantic endeavors or accept that it will sit still as long as you let it.

Preferably to the point of intense pain.</p>\n<p>\tThere, I said it. Open hand-ass contact makes me horny, because in my opinion, there’s nothing more complementary to pleasure than a small dose of hurt. And don’t think I’m alone; there’s something in the idea of being wrongfully punished while doing the nasty that puts many on a nonstop train to O-town. My rationale is that if you’re being disobedient in society, you get punished, so why should we let our partners get away with bedroom naughtiness without being penile-ized? Bottom line, naughty girls and boys need discipline, and there’s nothing more humanitarian than a citizen’s arrest.</p>\n<p>\tThe fact that discipline in the bedroom makes us dirty thinkers wetter than a beer-soaked pong ball got me thinking about a possibly disturbing lack of BDSM in Isla Vista sack sessions. Now I know what you’re thinking: You don’t necessarily keep a pleather unitard, spiked collar or a gag ball in the trunk of your car for emergency kink-fests — which by the way, I highly suggest. But I’m here to tell you that there is a much more accessible way to approach sadomasochism that doesn’t require the burning flesh and dungeons displayed on your go-to porn site. Here’s a little beginner’s guide to bedroom discipline and bondage. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>\tSpanking is really just the tip of the penis, there’s a whole shaft of simple dominance and submission techniques that are sure to strike a yummy dose of panic and pleasure in your nether regions. The fact is that helplessness can be a seriously sexy aphrodisiac. I’m all about coital equality, so the key is to experiment with power play and push each other’s limits of pain toleration. Hair pulling can make even the dullest missionary moment a thrill. Then try sinking your teeth into some real meat: the many surfaces of your partner’s body. Synchronize digging your nails into that sweaty back with your ascent to climax. And asphyxiation doesn’t have to be a solo dance with Vaseline and a noose, so cut off some air with the two-handed choke-n-stroke. If you make it less slave-and- master and more mutual dominance, your girlfriend won’t be forced to believe you’re a psycho porn addict or trying to brutally murder her with your bare hands. </p>\n<p>\tAs a point of clarification, donkey punching a bitch is not a form of erotic domination. Think classy kinky. Try out some PG-13 props. In my opinion, every sexually active student on this campus should own a pair of handcuffs, the ideal tool for erotic defenselessness. Getting all tied up while getting down makes sex a much wilder adventure. Bring a chair into the equation, invite your favorite vibrator to the pants party — anything goes in beginner’s S&amp;M. Anal beads and nipple clamps can get a bit intimidating, so keep it simple to start, but if it’s a ring your cock craves, don’t deny yourself the pleasure, you fetishist, you.</p>\n<p>\tLastly, note that domination roleplay doesn’t have to involve ass paddles and a mistress named Veronica Vulva (though if you’re planning said situation, shoot me a Facebook invite). Roleplay can be as simple as the dominator taking on the persona of an authority figure — think naughty professor in control of your final grade or bad-boy boss unimpressed with your secretarial filing work. Then switch it up, turning the school girl or secretary into the seductress. After all, our annual designated roleplay holiday is just around the corner, so put those dangerously delicious Halloween costumes up for some real work this weekend and beyond. Those Sergeant Sexy and Doctor Dick outfits will certainly get the balls rolling on some kinky fantasies.</p>\n<p>\tListen, the truth is that people need to be more comfortable with their inner freaks. Being spanked and told that I’m a dirty little bitch makes me happy. So I bid you, get on your backs and get that kinky sex you need. There is more to the Gaucho spirit than merely being a nympho; you must foremost be an individualist.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/pain-pleather-pleasure/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/pain-pleather-pleasure/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/pain-pleather-pleasure/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/pain-pleather-pleasure/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/pain-pleather-pleasure/","id":6350,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6349,6348,6347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Humpin’ for the First Time: The Ins and Outs of Virginity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In an age where pornography is just a few clicks away, shampoo commercials are practically orgasmic and private areas can be bejeweled, one might consider the concept of “chastity” to be a thing o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In an age where pornography is just a few clicks away, shampoo commercials are practically orgasmic and private areas can be bejeweled, one might consider the concept of “chastity” to be a thing of the past. Yet in our society, women are still expected to remain chaste. But to be clear, it’s just women; men are generally raised to view their virginity as a burden, giving them reason to explore and act upon their sexuality.</p>\n<p>For many women, religion serves as the primary force keeping them from having sex. Some ultimately decide that God will not hate them for having premarital sex. However, Jenny, a third year (all names have been changed), was raised Mormon, so the influence of religion was much stronger. “[In my religion,] sexual immorality is second to murder,” she said. “I had to keep it a secret from my friends and family.” Her guilt didn’t come from her deflowering, but instead from the fear of disappointing others.</p>\n<p>Others said that factors aside from the physical act of having sex were what later led to regret. “I felt a bit like chewed bubblegum afterwards,” Marisa, a third year, said. “Not because I wasn’t ready or I didn’t do it right, but because I didn’t match that pure idea of myself that my parents and church gave me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jenny expressed a sentiment that many others agreed with: “I felt I built it up a lot more than I should have,” she said. “It wasn’t as big of a deal as I thought.”</p>\n<p>That’s not to say virginity isn’t important: Losing it in a special manner can establish healthy habits for your future love life. But as Claire, a second year, stated, “If you want to make it a big deal in your life, go for it. But don’t assume that’s the case for other people and don’t judge them for what they’ve done and their feelings towards virginity.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to women who are still virgins, the perceived stereotypes can be equally frustrating. “Either you’re religious or some sort of square,” Julie said.</p>\n<p>“It defeats your connections most of the time. [People think that] if we can’t have sex, we can’t have a relationship,” Claire said.</p>\n<p>Many virgins agreed that upon meeting the right person, they would be ready to lose it, which brings up another point: Why is “losing” your virginity the accepted terminology? Losing has a negative connotation, implying that upon sharing the act with someone, you are left without something valued and important; you are less than you were. Women are constantly told that their virginity is a gift, yet feel that they can’t pursue their sexual desires until they “lose it” appropriately. Yet even after they do, they are constantly burdened by the idea of “their number,” Julie said. If it exceeds a certain range, it’s a point of embarrassment; if it’s comparable to that of a man, it’s shameful.</p>\n<p>The shame goes to a whole new level in foreign countries like Turkey, where virginity is a representation of the family’s honor as well as of the idea that the woman’s body belongs to her husband. According to Human Rights Watch, Turkish women are subjected to virginity examinations prior to marriage, and though technically allowed to refuse, they are pressured by both their family and the police to consent. If the hymen is broken, the woman is deemed a non-virgin, unfit to marry and is often subjected to ridicule and abuse by her family and community. It doesn’t matter if the hymen was broken by doing the splits or taking a horseback ride; if it’s broken, you’re shamed.</p>\n<p>According to Solomon Rothmon, a writer at Yahoo! Voices, proof of being unchaste is also a valid reason for a woman to be permanently expelled from the formal education system. In the face of this immense pressure, many women commit suicide prior to their examination in hopes of saving face.</p>\n<p>The extremist views continue to shock … Human Rights Watch also reports that if a Turkish man sexually assaults a woman, he can get out of the charges if he marries his victim. Oftentimes this is something families will push for to avoid humiliation, leaving their daughter, sister or niece to live out their lives with someone who violated them.</p>\n<p>Even in America, where such laws would be considered a heinous affront to our liberties, the perceptions Americans hold can still be just as damaging.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really dangerous for women’s self-esteem and self-worth and for how they feel about themselves generally,” Jenny said. “It’s sad that sexual acts or lack of them can be harmful to your emotional state … People get so confused by an identity that doesn’t matter. It’s no one’s business and if people choose to judge virgins or non-virgins harshly based on their gender, then fuck you!”</p>\n<p>Seeing the stark differences among cultures highlights the idea that virginity is a social concept. But is that concept still relevant? America is asking women to fulfill contrasting ideas: “be the virgin” and “be the sexpert.”</p>\n<p>As varying sexualities and habits enter the public eye, what still constitutes sex? Is oral sex considered sex? Is mutual masturbation? Does using a toy constitute as sex? What about lesbians? A male organ will never penetrate them, so does that mean they are “doomed” to be virgins forever? If these things are not considered sex, then we perpetuate the notion of “everything-but” virgins, sexual beings who have not yet taken what we consider to be the final step.</p>\n<p>It is disturbing that someone’s identity can depend so heavily on something that eventually happens to everyone. It’s unfair that women are the only ones shouldering this burden. We need to accept that the ideas that held up before do not necessarily hold up today. Virginity is a social construct, and an outdated one at that.</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. puts the “jazz” in vajazzle.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1511392043\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51596\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51597\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/humpin-for-the-first-time-the-ins-and-outs-of-virginity/tomydate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg?fit=450%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"450,675\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"tomydate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate.jpg?fit=450%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51597\" alt=\"tomydate\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tomydate-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the May 29, 2013 print version of the<em> Nexus.</em></h6>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
