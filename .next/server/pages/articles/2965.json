(<em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Members of the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) were in attendance during public forum of the Associated Students Senate meeting last night to combat a bill that would reduce S.C.O.R.E.’s decision-making authority regarding the planning of the Student of Color Conference (S.O.C.C.), shifting authority instead to the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs.</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E. is a campus organization that advocates for the rights for students of color and other underrepresented communities, and S.O.C.C. is a UC Students Association conference held this past weekend at UC Merced in which students discuss, among other topics, issues surrounding race. The controversial bill will be headed to the External Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow night to be voted on.</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. outreach coordinator Allison Bettencourt said the bill unfairly shifts the ability to organize S.O.C.C attendance to the EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it’s my understanding that it would be pulled out of S.C.O.R.E.’S jurisdiction to organize and put into the EVPSA’s,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this is wrong because S.C.O.R.E. has historically organized the Student of Color Conference delegation.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. member Leilani Riahi said the commission has always served minority students and that putting power in the hands of a non-minority would be detrimental to the students of color community.</p>\n<p>“The people in S.C.O.R.E. have always been there to serve this one purpose,” Riahi said. “They’re doing it for others. I know these people, I’ve seen them, worked with them to be elected to this space. You have to have communities of color in mind. Always. We’re already so marginalized, we already don’t have enough power in these fucking institutions, and to institutionalize racism … just give us this conference.”</p>\n<p>Bettencourt also said there was a lack of diversity on campus and that it is important to keep the power within the S.C.O.R.E. to compensate for the imbalance.</p>\n<p>“I believe our school has the least diversity of any other school and because of that, it is more necessary and pertinent than ever that the Student Commission on Racial Equality continues to organize this,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this Student of Color Conference falls directly under the mission of S.C.O.R.E. which is to educate people about the issues that affects students of color and to organize around those issues.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58250\" style=\"width: 579px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"800180484\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58217\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58250\" data-attachment-id=\"58250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/as-senate-by-kenneth-song_for-11-12-2014-7778/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=1200%2C817&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,817\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415834446\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate by Kenneth Song_for 11.12.2014-7778\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58250\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778-1024x697.jpg?resize=569%2C386\" alt=\"(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"569\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Second year pre-biology major and S.C.O.R.E. diversity educator Kyron Covington said it is essential that students of color organize S.O.C.C attendance and quoted Malcolm X, stating that “only a fool would let his enemy teach his children.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to condemn the proposed bill to take S.O.C.C away from S.C.O.R.E. because I would be a fool to let it happen,” Covington said. “For people that are new to these issues or ideas of social justice and problems that affect my community, I won’t let anyone else teach them because I know my community best. S.O.C.C. is organized by students of color because we would be fools otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur said that if the bill is passed and the committee created to choose S.C.O.R.E attendees is occupied by Caucasian students, it would contradict the purpose of S.C.O.R.E and their conference.</p>\n<p>“This five person committee y’all are suggesting could be all white, besides these S.C.O.R.E. co-chairs,” Kaur said. “It’s never acceptable for a majority white board to organize who gets to go to the Students of Color Conference.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is not in favor of this bill, at least not in the current language it is written in.</p>\n<p>“I think the conference bill, the language needs to be clarified,” Singh said. “I think people are getting the misconception that I for some reason want to take over these conferences, that’s not what’s happening. I’m personally opposed to anything that takes power from any AS entities, like that’s not what I envision that bill to be.”</p>\n<p>A version of the story appeared on page 4 of the Nov. 13, 2014 print

id=\"caption-attachment-58032\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Carsey-Wolf Center hosted Fred Raskin, editor of the hugely popular Marvel Cinematic Universe film “Guardians of the Galaxy.” <em>Photo courtesy of Disney</em></p></div>\n<p>“Guardians of the Galaxy” film editor Fred Raskin spoke during a Q&amp;A session yesterday in the Pollock Theater as a part of a three week series by the Carsey-Wolf Center called “Focus On: The Editor.”</p>\n<p>Film and Media Studies professor Joshua Moss, who is also Raskin’s friend, interviewed the film editor about his work, which includes “Boogie Nights,” “All the Pretty Horses” and<em> “</em>Kill Bill 1 and<em> </em>2<em>.”</em> Raskin also transitioned into editing for Justin<em> </em>Lin on<em> “</em>Better Luck Tomorrow,” “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,” “Fast  Five,” “Django Unchained” and “Guardians of the Galaxy<em>.” </em>His next project will be Quentin Tarantino’s next film “The Hateful Eight,” a film about bounty hunters in post-Civil War Wyoming.</p>\n<p>Raskin said he began working on films right after graduating from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and worked with James Gunn on one of his first jobs, a 1997 comedy called “Tromeo &amp; Juliet.” Raskin said he and Gunn had kept in touch since their work on that project, and that it was he who invited him to work on “Guardians of the Galaxy.”</p>\n<p>According to Raskin, he was more involved with “Guardians of the Galaxy” than any other movie he has worked on in the past, mostly because meeting with the Marvel executives about the project took an extensive amount of time. According to Raskin, meetings would take about three hours every day.</p>\n<p>“We would all sit in a room and we would talk about everything from how we are going to tackle one particular scene that might be problematic, to how we were going to restructure the first third of the movie for what we’re going to shoot when it comes to the additional photography phase of the movie,” Raskin said.</p>\n<p>Raskin said a particularly difficult aspect of his work on the film involved the challenges posed by fleshing out the character of Ronan, the film’s villain.</p>\n<p>“Probably the biggest problem the story had was the villain storyline,” Raskin said. “That Ronan’s motives weren’t entirely clear and he just wasn’t so well-developed so a lot of the recent material was there to make his goals more focused.”</p>\n<p>According to Moss, the strong point of “Guardians of the Galaxy” is the way the characters interact with one another while dealing with the orb, as the character interaction among “these five misfits” succeeds in conveying each character arc.</p>\n<p>“When I first saw it, what was interesting to me was the slapstick comedy bit where they’re all grabbing the orb early on in the film,” Moss said. “Is important because it sets up the idea that the orb gets to be something everybody else wants. The orb is the way we get to see characters but it’s not what the movie is really about.”</p>\n<p>Raskin said another challenging aspect of “Guardians of the Galaxy” was working with the comedic elements of the film.</p>\n<p>“In terms of comedy, we determined what jokes worked and what jokes didn’t and that’s the kind of thing that you feel when you watch the movie with an audience,” Raskin said.</p>\n<p>According to film and media studies undergraduate advisor Joe Palladino, the “Focus On: The Editor” series includes people with various positions in the film industry.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a ‘Focus on: Directors,’ we had a ‘Focus on: Music Videos,’ we had a ‘Focus on: Sound,’ so we wanted to do a ‘Focus on Editing,’” Palladino said. “We do a lot of screen writing stuff, the script to screen stuff, so we wanted to look at different people who maybe understand. They appreciate and try to bring someone in and give that person a little bit of a spotlight.”</p>\n<p>Palladino said the goal with Raskin’s presentation was to highlight the importance of the work of editors and other positions in the industry do that typically do not receive as much attention from audiences.</p>\n<p>“The editors are often people that are ignored and so we are looking at editors now for the series,” Palladino said. “There are a lot of students who say ‘I want to be a director,’ but there are so many other creative things, so we start presenting them with other creative fields. The idea of the Pollock programming is to give everyone a wide spectrum of film.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Editor in Chief at Rutgers University Press Leslie Mitchner gave a lecture yesterday on the effects of modern technology on print publishing at the Social Sciences and Media Studies Building.</p>\n<p>During the lecture, hosted by the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center, Mitchner discussed the concerns administrators and students have in regards to changes in digital access to print publications. Mitchner’s discussion primarily touched on the relationship between digital and traditional print publishing.</p>\n<p>According to Mitchner, the progression of modern technology is not a threat to the publishing industry, but rather poses “an opportunity and a challenge.”</p>\n<p>“We just have to figure out how to use those resources better,” Mitchner said. “Revenue is declining, but the industry will persevere one way or another. I think that the future will continue for university presses and commercial presses.”</p>\n<p>Film and media studies caps associate professor and coordinator of the event Jennifer Holt said she hopes faculty and graduate students in attendance gained a wider perspective on the effects of digital publishing from Mitchner’s lecture.</p>\n<p>“I think it was an opportunity for these students to get a better perspective on what it means to be an author or to be in the literary business, from any perspective,” Holt said, “as a publisher, as an editor, as an author or even as a reader in this kind of time.”</p>\n<p>Assistant professor of sociology Zakiya Luna said that Mitchner’s advice gave her a better understanding of the digitization of the publishing industry.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important to think about these new forms of digital media and how to engage them,” Luna said. “It’s important to make sure that the different work we are publishing in different fields can potentially have a broader impact, keeping in mind the realities of what’s changed about academic publishing as we are writing our own work.”</p>\n<p>According to Luna, the lecture helped explain how the industry’s transition from print to online will affect current and future writers.</p>\n<p>“As publishing changes by the minute, it’s also really important that we as authors and scholars have the latest information,” Luna said. “It’s really exciting that the campus has supported an event like this and hopefully this will continue conversations about what is happening with publishing and how we can make sure that our work is speaking to those changing needs.”</p>\n<p>History department chair and professor Elizabeth Digeser hopes that the discussion with Mitchner will provide insight for current and interested publishers on how to adapt to the changes of the evolving publishing industry.</p>\n<p>“I have published in traditional formats — book and articles — but I know that there have been important changes in how research is communicated,” Digeser said. “I’d like to know more about what the current trends are so that I can take advantage of the new opportunities and can advise my graduate students as I do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth year graduate student in the Dept. of Film and Media Studies Rachel Fabian said she thought the discussion was very informative for graduate students looking to publish, such as herself.</p>\n<p>“As grad students on such a large campus, it’s often times difficult to get events catered for humanities scholars who are looking to publish,” Fabian said, “so it was very nice to have someone from Rutgers University Press who deals specifically with humanities subfields to talk to us about those very unique things that sometimes we don’t get a chance to talk about that much.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Whereas once we have solar, we know there’s a payback time and then it’s energy that we’re not really paying for anymore.”</p>\n<p>Riley said the use of solar panels is more environmentally friendly and that the continued reliance on non-renewable energy is not justified.</p>\n<p>“It’s just so much cleaner,” Riley said. “There’s no real reason to keep using fossil fuels if we don’t have to, and we think we don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>According to LEED program manager Jordan Sager, their office handles the design of systems and the campus energy bills and works with Southern California Edison to obtain permits for projects such as the one on Lot 22. Sager also said a motivating factor behind the construction of the solar panel system has been UC President Janet Napolitano’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>“A little less than a year ago, when Janet Napolitano took her role as President of the UC, she announced an initiative that all the UC campuses would be carbon neutral by 2025,” Sager said. “So we’re kind of working towards working out what that means for our campus, and how we’re going to get there.”</p>\n<p>Senior Project Manager of the Design and Construction Services George Levinthal said the design of the system had to be reevaluated several times due to unforeseen issues with the module type and the structure of the system. The module type that was initially selected experienced a radical increase in demand, making it impossible to purchase without going way over budget.</p>\n<p>Levinthal said the original structure plan had to be redesigned to better accommodate the solar panels.</p>\n<p>“There were structural issues, so we went back and determined that the truss system that we have now would work much better structurally for its effect on the building,” Levinthal said. “So we went back and it was redesigned using a truss system to support the panels, and by doing that we ended up with fewer panels and less kW generating capacity than we had originally had in the first design.”</p>\n<p>According to Levinthal, Lot 22 is an ideal location for a solar energy system because the parking structure had been built with future plans for solar energy in mind. The concrete columns were strengthened to support the panels, and electrical conduits were run from the basement to the roof as preparation for the prospect of putting solar panels in.</p>\n<p>Riley also said student support for the Renewable Energy Initiative referendum, which has charged students $6 in their fees since fall 2010 and will continue to do so until 2020, is largely responsible for the solar panel installation.</p>\n<p>“Students thought it was worthwhile, very worthwhile, and voted for it. So that’s where the money’s coming from,” Riley said. “And it’s being augmented with other funds from the Student Resource Building Governance Board and the Student Fee Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/","id":2964,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[2963,2962,2961],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
