Whether when coming off screens, off the dribble or even contested, Porter’s hot shooting hand was consistent as she made 6-of-6 three-pointers and two free-throws in the game’s first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Balancing Porter’s three-point shooting was redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman with a dominant performance in the paint. For a third time this season, Edelman tied her career-high of 22 points. Also, Edelman’s game-high 14 rebounds led to her tallying her eighth double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Signs of Porter’s career night began with her scoring the game’s first basket form long range. From that point on, both teams exchanged scores. Responding on UCR’s behalf was Malou Thiebaut De Kergret with a made three-pointer to give the Highlanders a 10-8 lead. The sophomore forward had 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting before fouling out later on.</p>\n<p>The one-point deficit was the last time UCSB trailed before responding with a 15-0 run. Sparking the run was Porter with her third-straight three-pointer at the 4:53 mark of the first. The Gauchos’ lead increased from a layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler to 23-10, leading to UCR calling a timeout as it had been held scoreless for a little over five minutes.</p>\n<p>Toler concluded Wednesday night with 13 points, eight assists, and two steals.</p>\n<p>Breaking the Highlanders’ scoring slump was a jumpshot by junior guard Michelle Curry. Junior guard Lauren Holt scored on UCR’s next possession to cut their deficit to single digits at 14-23.</p>\n<p>But another three-pointer by Porter in the final five second of the first quarter gave UCSB a 26-14 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being down to start the second quarter, Curry took matters into her own hands, embarking on an individual 8-2 run that cut UCSB’s lead to 28-22. She scored 11 of her team-high 22 points in the period.</p>\n<p>Although Riverside managed to contain Porter’s perimeter shooting during the quarter, holding her to just one missed shot attempt, UCSB responded with a 7-2 run of its own. The scoring stretch built its lead to 35-24.</p>\n<p>UCR cut the Gaucho’s lead to a five-point deficit three times during the period as a made free-throw by Curry left the Highlanders down 37-42 entering halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game with a 40-26 advantage in both rebounds and points in the paint. The outcome of both values led to Edelman’s big night, which picked up at the start of the second half as she scored the Gauchos first six points of the third.</p>\n<p>Still, the Highlanders continued to claw away at Santa Barbara’s lead. After Curry’s jumpshot brought UCR within three at 48-51 before a layup by UCSB’s Toler, Kergret knocked down a three-pointer on Riverside’s next possession that resulted in a 51-53 deficit with 4:49 remaining in the third.</p>\n<p>As UCSB was in a position of possibly losing its lead, emerging was Porter from beyond the arc to give it a 56-51 lead. Igniting the Gaucho’s 11-4 run to end the period was a three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. Toler scored the team’s last field goal with a layup, helping UCSB enter the fourth with a 67-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Similar to how the game began, Edelman and Porter scored UCSB’s first points in the game’s final period to put the Gauchos up 72-61.</p>\n<p>Porter scored her coveted ninth three-pointer of the game with 5:18 remaining, giving UCSB a 77-63 lead. Both teams would end up trading baskets and taking trips to the free-throw line with Edelman scoring the Gauchos’ last field goal of the game to eventually lock up their victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Davis this Friday, March 10 in the semifinal round of the Big West Tournament at noon.

Powell brought in eight points in the first half as well as six rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Mustang roster, senior guard Ridge Shipley and sophomore guard Donovan Fields led Cal Poly, going eight and six respectively in the first period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shooting started off with a jump shot from Powell and a quick three-pointer in response from Fields. Both teams traded baskets consistently until the 12th minute when only four points were scored, one from Mustang junior guard Victor Joseph and the other from Gaucho junior forward J.D. Slajchert, until 7:40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The score was kept relatively close until the sixth minute when UCSB made a small charge to take the lead 23-18, thanks to a surge of energy from freshman guard Max Heidegger along with Powell. After a three-pointer from Shipley at 3:54, no further points were scored in the first period, putting the score at 27-23 Gauchos at the half. </span></p>\n<p>At no point did the Mustangs ever catch up to the Gauchos; the closest they came to closing the lead was right at the beginning of the second period with a jump shot one minute in from junior forward Luke Meikle, bringing the score to 27-25.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to score 30 in the second half, 12 of which came exclusively from Childress. Overall, Childress led the board with 19 points, the next closest scorers only bringing in 10 each. He had a great game with three steals and two assists.</span></p>\n<p>Junior forward Alex Hart only put four on the board tonight, a few less than he has been lately, but managed to snatch up 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to run away with the score, starting with a jump shot from freshman guard Christian Terrell. From 16:49 to 11:47, UCSB brought in 14 points while Cal Poly had seven missed shots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last five minutes of the game were characterized by a three-pointer and jump shot by Heidegger and four foul shots from Childress as well as a three-pointer from Victor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB came away with a 39.0 field goal percentage, well above Cal Poly’s 30.5. Santa Barbara had 45 rebounds and profited 13 points off of turnovers while the Mustangs had 36 rebounds and made six points off of turnovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 16 points from the Gaucho bench, 10 of which belonged to Heidegger, who continues to improve and play with fire and speed.

We had some shining moments and some scary moments.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing arguably their best game of the year, the Gauchos drop to 3-13 in the Big West and 8-21 overall. Cal Poly, on the other hand, improves to 11-5 in conference and 17-12 overall, clinching the second seed in the Big West Tournament. The loss is the seventh straight to the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>With the regular season done, UCSB now waits on the UC Riverside game tonight at 7 p.m., which will determine if the Gauchos go to the Big West Tournament. Hosting Long Beach, the Gauchos need Riverside to lose as the Highlanders own the tiebreaker.</p>\n<p>“We’ll just pray that the basketball gods are with the Gauchos and they know we still haven’t played our best basketball yet,” Mitchell said. “There’s a game later tonight that controls our destiny and that’s unfortunate.”</p>\n<p>A back and forth game the entirety of the contest, Santa Barbara took a 58-57 lead with 7:13 remaining off a layup from senior guard Destini Mason. However, the lead would be short-lived as Cal Poly’s league-leading offense took over.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs shot just 8-24 from three-point range, Cal Poly drained three triples down the stretch, two coming from Elegado. On the game, Elegado shot 11-22 from the field, including 6-13 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“There were communication breakdowns. We tried to mix it up more than normal, so maybe our kids weren’t as comfortable,” Mitchell said. “Late in the game, [Elegado] knocked down two critical threes and pretty much sealed the game. A great player like that, you give her an inch and she’s going to knock it down. She willed her team to a win today.”</p>\n<p>While Elegado erupted on the offensive end, UCSB did a solid job on 6’5’’ star Molly Schlemer. The Gauchos held Schlemer to 13 points and 10 rebounds, compared to her 37 point, 15 rebound performance in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>In fact, junior center Clair Watkins outplayed Schlemer, tallying a double-double on a career-high 16 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly’s a big rivalry game and Schlemer had quite a few points last game,” Watkins said. “I just wanted to come out here and help my teammates and seniors and prove that UCSB can definitely hang with Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Santa Barbara actually outshot Cal Poly 43.7 percent to 39.7 percent, but was unable to get key defensive stops down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Along with Watkins, all three seniors finished in double-figures on senior day. Mason also tallied a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“It was difficult (playing on senior day),” Mason said. “It was very emotional, but I tried to look past it and be like. ‘It’s a normal game.’ But everyone comes to you and says ‘it’s your senior day,’ so you can’t ignore it. You have to embrace it.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB earns the final spot into the conference tournament, it will play next Tuesday at Long Beach State against the fifth seed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54430\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54430\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/","id":515,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[514,513,512],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for Postseason Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB takes on UC Davis in the first round of the Big West Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>When the eighth seed Gauchos travel to Long Beach State tomorrow where they will take on fifth seed UC Davis in the first round of the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara isn’t expected to win.</p>\n<p>They’ve had a disappointing season, finishing the year at 8-20 overall and 3-13 in the Big West.

If UC Riverside had beat Long Beach Saturday, the Gauchos’ season would be over.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Santa Barbara, it is playing in the postseason and records no longer matter.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s really excited,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “The first thing [Head Coach Carlene Mitchell] told us today when we walked into film was that we’re 0-0. Whatever happened during the regular season doesn’t matter now. We’re ready to make a run and upset teams.”</p>\n<p>Going into the Big West Tournament as the last seed makes the Gauchos the major underdogs, and that’s how they like it.</p>\n<p>The situation is reminiscent to two years ago when UCSB entered the conference tournament as the sixth seed. The team caught fire, winning the Big West Tournament and punching its ticket to the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>“The kids know we have an uphill battle, but they also saw what USC did this past week,” Mitchell said. “We’ve been a low seed before and won games to get to the NCAA (Tournament). It’s March Madness and it’s called that for a reason.”</p>\n<p>But before Santa Barbara can think too far ahead, it has to take care of the task at hand. Tonight, that’s beating UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Both teams head to Long Beach with their final games of the regular season resulting in losses. The Aggies fell to UC Irvine Saturday while the Gauchos lost to rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB played very well against the Mustangs, which will take the second seed in the Tournament. If Santa Barbara takes the intensity it had Saturday to Long Beach tomorrow, the Gauchos could upset a lot of teams.</p>\n<p>The reason UCSB came out with the loss Saturday was defensive breakdowns down the stretch. The Gauchos gave Cal Poly’s outside shooters too much space and the Mustangs took advantage. Elegado hit two in the final minutes to clinch the game, recording a career-high 32 points on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>While UCSB played a solid game Saturday, the defensive breakdowns speak to Santa Barbara’s struggles all year long. Offense is not causing losses. Unlike in years prior where scoring was tough, this year it’s the defensive lapses and lack of consistency that put the Gauchos in the bottom of the standings.</p>\n<p>“We always focus on defense,” Zornig said. “We’ve been playing a lot of zone lately, but we’re going to mix it up. We just have to play disciplined.”</p>\n<p>In their two meetings with the Aggies this year, the Gauchos failed to put together more than 20 minutes of good basketball. In the first meeting in Davis, UCSB played well in the first half, but fell apart in the second, allowing UCD to shoot 41.7 percent from three point range. In the more recent matchup, Santa Barbara didn’t come to play, going down 15-2 to start the game. Davis shot 56 percent in the first half before the Gauchos played the Aggies even in the second half.</p>\n<p>“It’s the defensive side of things (that matter),” Mitchell said. “We have to do a better job on our post defense because they went at us all night long. We may mix it up like we did with Poly and see if it helps change the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The matchup of the game tomorrow will be down low with junior center Clair Watkins versus sophomore forward Alyson Doherty. Doherty averages 13.1 points per game, shooting a league-leading 55.7 percent from the field. Against the Gauchos, she’s upped her production, averaging 19 points in the two meetings.</p>\n<p>But as of late, UCSB also has a post presence inside in Watkins. The last five games, Watkins has nearly averaged a double-double at 10 points and 9.2 rebounds. Against Cal Poly, she held last year’s Big West Player of the Year, senior center Molly Schlemer, to 13 points. Meanwhile, Watkins tallied superior numbers at 16 points and 12 rebounds. While Santa Barbara is a guard-driven team, its success depends on Watkins.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to take the momentum I got in the Cal Poly game and try to carry it into the Davis game,” Watkins said. “[Doherty] had a good game here when they played us, but I think we’re all ready. It comes down to post defense for me.”</p>\n<p>The other player UCSB will keep an eye on is junior forward Sydnee Fipps. Named an All-Big West first team member today, Fipps ranks third in the conference in scoring at 17.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB may pull a triangle-and-two defense out of its pocket. Led by Doherty and Fipps, the Aggies rank first in field goal percentage, shooting an impressive 42.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos aren’t far behind in that category, shooting 41.1 percent.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to beat a team three times,” Watkins said. “We’ve learned a lot from playing them twice. We know their go-to players, their moves and what they want to do on offense and defense, so hopefully we can learn and apply it and finally get a win against them.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. at Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-10/gauchos-set-for-postseason-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-10/gauchos-set-for-postseason-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-10/gauchos-set-for-postseason-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-10/gauchos-set-for-postseason-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-10/gauchos-set-for-postseason-play/","id":516,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[515,514,513],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
