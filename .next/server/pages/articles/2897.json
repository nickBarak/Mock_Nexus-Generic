On the surface, it was a very solid 90-80 win in which Hines Ward got me 19 points. But even then I could see the danger signs. Four of my players scored under 10 points, and my second and third top scorers were my defense and my kicker.</p>\n<p>When you rely on those positions to win games for you, you are essentially relying on luck and on your opponent’s negligence when it comes to setting his or her roster.</p>\n<p>As it happened, luck played a large role. My opponent’s defense got him -3 points after having performed fairly well in the weeks prior, and one of his running backs, LeSean McCoy, had an off day. So even though I got the win, I had little reason to be happy about my team’s performance.</p>\n<p>A week later I had another close win, this time 99-87, but the same problems plagued me. My three top scorers were BenJarvus Green-Ellis, who got me 24 points, Calvin Johnson, who got 28 points, and, for the second straight week, my kicker, Sebastian Janikowski, who got 15 points. Five of my nine players scored six points or fewer, and once again my win came down to luck that my opponent chose not to start Matthew Stafford, who got 24 points that day, opting instead to start Tom Brady, who got 13.</p>\n<p>The next week it became clear that my luck was up. My top three scorers got me 16, 11 and 10 points and the number two scorer was Janikowski once again. The rest of my players got me eight points or fewer, and the only reason I managed to scrape out a 60-50 win was because the only player on my opponent’s team who got him over seven points was his quarterback.</p>\n<p>And that brings us back to the point where my luck finally ran out. I knew it was going to happen eventually. I was not surprised to find that, after getting me a total of six points over the past two weeks, Hines Ward put up a goose egg, or that Larry Fitzgerald, who had one strong showing all season, only mustered 11 points against a decent Seahawks defense.</p>\n<p>I saw this loss coming based on the way I was getting my wins. I was riding the coattails of a few players while the rest of my team attempted to drag me down. A winning season is built on consistently strong performances from the entire team. Those days are good fantasy days, even if they result in a loss. A strong loss means you suffered from bad luck, and it is likely that you will rebound. A weak win, however, usually is the result of a weak team, and foreshadows losses.</p>\n<p>That is why a win does not always equal a good fantasy day. A good day is made from a strong team performance that does not appear to be a fluke. And if your team can’t give you that, you better hope luck is on your side.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: Matt Cassel, QB, Kansas City Chiefs. He’s available in 60 percent of leagues and is averaging 15 points over the last five games. However, the fantasy playoffs are coming up in a few weeks, and it’s time to start preparing. If you’re in and want to stock up or you’re right on the edge and need something to push you over, then instead of over-searching through a depleted waiver wire, make a trade with a team that is out of contention. It’s more likely that you’ll find what you need there.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg knows just how to judge a good fantasy day, if you know what I mean.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29957\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/green-advice-green-people-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29957\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/green-advice-green-people-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/green-advice-green-people-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/green-advice-green-people-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/green-advice-green-people-wins/","id":2897,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2896,2895,2894],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg","biography":"Not available","articles":[286,294,298,299,410,422,425,430,1687,2124,2127,2130,2137,2139,2287,2304,2786,2808,2865,2871,2894,2897,3055,3145,3500,3501,4518,4529,5174,5175,5176,5177,5178,5180,5181,5182,5184,5188,5212,5216,5221,5222,5223,5224,5225,5226,5227,5228,5229,5235,5255,5256,5257,5463,5464,5466,5552],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: How to See the Future","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There is always one.

So with Donovan McNabb, my usual starter, on a bye week, I did not hesitate to start Henne when he went up against a Ravens defense that was not what it used to be. I should have hesitated.</p>\n<p>Henne rewarded my confidence with his worst day as a starting quarterback. He threw for just 231 yards and zero touchdowns, and complemented that with three interceptions and two fumbles for a grand total of four fantasy points. Luckily for me, the team I was facing did so badly that I didn’t need Henne in order to win, but I know I won’t always be so lucky.</p>\n<p>Henne is not the first player to let me down, and he won’t be the last. Week 1 it was Calvin Johnson. Week 2 it was Hines Ward.  Week 7 it was Larry Fitzgerald. And next week? It could be anyone. All I know for certain is that someone will attempt to sabotage my fantasy day and there is nothing I can do to stop them.</p>\n<p>Read into matchups to root out problems and set the best possible lineup each week. It is only because I had players like Aaron Hernandez and Sebastian Janikowski in my lineup that I managed to scrape out a win, and it is only because I knew how poorly the Cleveland Browns were doing against tight ends that I knew to start Hernandez.</p>\n<p>The fact is, you can’t predict letdowns. Even if a player has what seems to be a favorable matchup, they can still have off days for an unforeseeable reason such as injury or because that player’s team is just having a collective off day.</p>\n<p>All you can really do is attempt to set the strongest lineup possible week in and week out based on matchups and predictions, neither of which really mean anything, which basically means there is no real way to know if you are completely screwed or not. Having good players helps, but even they have off days. And on that note, I say to you good luck and may the force be with you. Trust me, you’re going to need it.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg never, ever leaves one cookie on the plate.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/green-advice-green-people-future/","id":2894,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2893,2892,2891],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: Back in Black (and Silver)","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The entire time I was writing this column, a little voice in my head was saying, “The Raiders?

It has to be hard to hit a receiver coming across the middle on a crossing route when you’re a little hungover on sizzurp.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But with the Raiders, it all starts with the front office. It seems the only explanation for Oakland’s success is that Al Davis — who eerily resembles a cross between an orc from “Lord of the Rings” and some sort of sea monster from “Pirates of the Caribbean” — is, in fact, dead. The franchise is finally able to function normally without him.</p>\n<p>On a serious note, Davis has made some great personnel decisions as of late, including the acquisition of Campbell and deciding to keep Head Coach Tom Cable while relieving him from play-calling duties. First-year offensive coordinator Hue Jackson has taken over this role, and the normally stagnant and even laughable offense has seen a major boost. Just halfway through the season, the Raiders’ offense is well on pace to pass their offensive production from all of last year in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>It seems a stable quarterback and a little bit of continuity in the coaching staff can go a long way. Take notes, 49ers.</p>\n<p>The star of the silver and black has been third-year running back Darren McFadden. If you haven’t seen him play, the dude is amazing and is finally living up to the hype that surrounded him when he left Arkansas. It seems the talent is back, and after two frustrating, injury-plagued seasons (believe me, I would know after owning McFadden in fantasy leagues the past two years) he has finally put it all together.</p>\n<p>In addition to boasting some of the best stats in the NFL so far this season, McFadden also boasts one of the bests nicknames in the league: RUN DMC (Get it? He runs. His first name starts with a D. And his last name has the MC… there goes the light bulb for some of you slower ones).</p>\n<p>Halfway through the season, the Raiders are currently second in the NFL in rushing, while DMC leads the league in yards per game with 108.1 and in yards after contact with 358  (more than his entire rushing yards total from last season), is fourth in rushing yards at 757 and third in yards per carry at 5.4.</p>\n<p>The Raiders have also fought to overcome adversity. The team started off 1-3 before turning their season around and going 4-1. After beating the Chiefs on Sunday, Oakland sits only a half game out of first place in the AFC West.</p>\n<p>The team has shifted its philosophy as of late, actually making strategic moves instead of the usual Oakland head-scratchers. Refraining from getting greedy in recent offseason free agency markets, building a good team through the draft and strategic acquisition such as Campbell and veteran defensive end Richard Seymour have paid dividends for the Raiders.</p>\n<p>Seymour has been an unbelievable pickup. Earlier this season, it looked like the Patriots’ front office had done it again, when the Raiders seemed destined for a top five pick — a pick that they traded to New England for Seymour. However, that pick is not looking to be as valuable as previously thought. Meanwhile, Seymour has provided leadership and excellent play on the field. The defensive line has been the strength of the Raiders’ defense, which is seventh in overall defense and third in passing defense. Seymour — who has 4.5 sacks and 4 tackles for loss on the year — constantly demands double-teams, which frees up other players.</p>\n<p>The bye week actually may be coming at the wrong time for the Raiders, who are riding their first three-game winning streak since their 2002 Super Bowl season. I say the Raiders are for real. Although we shouldn’t get too ahead of ourselves due to their recent success, the silver and black seem destined to challenge the Chiefs and the Chargers (who will make their usual late-season run) for an AFC West division title.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush sells purple drank by the barrel, and at a very reasonable cost.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-09/sunday-funday-black-silver/","id":2895,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2894,2893,2892],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: Musings from the NFL’s Week 10","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"From a great NFL season that just keeps giving and giving, here are a few observations from last week:","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>From a great NFL season that just keeps giving and giving, here are a few observations from last week:</p>\n<p>Brett Favre</p>\n<p>The 41-year-old followed up last week’s personal career best passing performance (446 yards) with a blunder at Chicago.

Pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>Troy Smith</p>\n<p>Just to satisfy all you 49er fans, here is the part where I write a couple of sentences about how good Troy Smith looked on Sunday. About how, as opposed to a certain other SF QB with the same last name, he actually looked like he was trying. How he brought a confidence and swagger to the offense, especially at the end of the game. How he threw for 356 yards — something Alex Smith failed to do for the Niners in 50 games as starter. Now Smith (Troy, that is) should be the starter going forward.</p>\n<p>And finally, here is the part where to the pleasure of Niner fans, I say that San Francisco — who is only two games behind first place Seattle — can take the NFC West this year, in which pathetically no team in the division has a positive point differential at the moment.</p>\n<p>Michael Vick</p>\n<p>Vick looked unbelievable Monday night. In a 59-28 crushing of the Redskins, he became the first player in the NFL with 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards, four passing TDs and two rushing TDs. Wow. He is 4-0 as a starter this year, and if he continues this play, he may win the MVP.</p>\n<p>The Unpredictability Continues</p>\n<p>The New York Giants entered Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys with a 6-2 record. They possessed the NFC’s top-ranked offense and defense and were riding a five-game winning streak (including a win over Dallas). The Cowboys were 1-7 and seemingly in turmoil, yet dominated the Giants from the onset of the game to win 33-20 in Head Coach Jason Garrett.</p>\n<p>The previously 2-6 Denver Broncos beat the Kansas City Chiefs handily on Sunday, a team that was 5-3 and boasted the league’s top rushing offense.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Denver’s early domination (they were up 21-0 in the first quarter), Chiefs QB Matt Cassel ended up with a monster fantasy day, passing for 469 yards and four touchdowns. Two touchdowns and 186 yards of which belonged to WR Dwayne Bowe, including a beautifully wrapped gift (for which this fantasy owner is extremely grateful for) in the form of a garbage TD with 10 seconds left with KC down by 26.</p>\n<p>Attempting to figure the league out this year is tough, but here are my top five teams right now:</p>\n<p>1.) Patriots (7-2): They just beat down the Steelers and showed why coaching is so important in the NFL — Belichick never loses two in a row.</p>\n<p>2.) Falcons (7-2): I believe in Matt Ryan. And Roddy White. For fantasy purposes, too.</p>\n<p>3.) Saints (6-3): They get Reggie Bush back, and aren’t they still the defending champs?</p>\n<p>5.) Eagles (6-3): With a larger sample size with Vick as quarterback, they could be even higher.</p>\n<p>4.) Jets (7-2): They are 7-2, and although he is inconsistent, Mark Sanchez finds a way to win close games (two in a row on the road in OT).</p>\n<p>Now, in the words of Jim Rome: I am out!</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush will be representing Daily Nexus Sports at the ESPYs in the category of best Jim Rome impression.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29950\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29950\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/sunday-funday-musings-nfls-week-10/","id":2896,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2895,2894,2893],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
