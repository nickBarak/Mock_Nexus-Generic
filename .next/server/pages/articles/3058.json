Speakers also called to question the clarity of the appointment process, particularly with regards to Committee on Committees and Elections Committee.</p>\n<p>University Owned Housing Senator for the 2012–2013 school year Miya Sommers addressed the Senate with concerns about the appointment process. Sommers took issue with the disqualification of Nicholas Dineen for Elections Committee on the grounds of party affiliation, as Dineen had been disqualified after he “liked” a Democratic Process Party Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel that going through someone’s Facebook and seeing something that they like on Facebook is grounds for neutrality,” Sommers said.</p>\n<p>Sommers also said the disqualification process was problematic as there had been inconsistencies for different positions. While Dineen had been originally recommended for the position through the interview process, he had later been disqualified, Sommers said.</p>\n<p>According to Sommers, the appointee for Attorney General Sawyeh Maghsoodloo should have been disqualified on the same grounds, as the attorney general position is also supposed to be a neutral position and Maghsoodloo was a chair of the Open People’s Party during A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“If he’s not being appointed, I have a problem with Sawyeh then being appointed,” Sommers said. “She has a clear party affiliation, and she’s not being docked on that.”</p>\n<p>After Sommers spoke, Maghsoodloo addressed the Senate to respond to some of Sommers’ claims. Maghsoodloo said she agreed the interview process needed improvement, but also said her own appointment had been legitimate.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Chair of Committee on Committees Asami Osato also came to public forum in order to answer senators’ questions regarding the application process. As chair, Osato was responsible for making the official appointment recommendations to the president.</p>\n<p>Osato said she felt the application process had been fair, with the interview process lasting approximately 15 hours every week for three weeks. She also said she felt party affiliation was not difficult to discern with candidates.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s pretty obvious whether or not you’re party affiliated,” Osato said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also decided to approve the appointments and during the meeting, the new executive officers delivered reports on their first weeks in office. Officers announced their decisions regarding their appointments for staff, while also discussing the progress of their respective offices.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore said he met with leaders of the queer community, who had expressed a desire to reach out to members of Greek life on campus.</p>\n<p>“They want to do some Greek outreach because they feel like there’s some problems coming from the fraternities especially,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate said she is focusing on the question of online education in the UC system, for which there are currently two bills in front of the California Senate.</p>\n<p>“The bills are SB 520, which we really don’t like because it basically is going to allow for the privatization of our education, allowing for private entities to come in and profit,” Choate said. “Another one is SB 547, but it doesn’t have nearly as much support in the Senate, as of right now.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud discussed the addition of a new position on his staff — the deputy chief of staff — while Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s report focused on transitions to the new Senate, discussing projects that must be handed down to new senators, including a Sobering Center in Isla Vista and an LGBTQ General Education requirement.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said he is working on a convention with the SAGs from colleges throughout Southern California, and that he has already begun working on his advocacy agenda.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/","id":3058,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3057,3056,3055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Don’t Overlook Your League’s Overlooked Talent","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Most fantasy owners don’t trust rookies and other smaller names to be consistent.

He’ll get a chance this year. Thus far, he has seen the majority of the starts for San Diego and appears to have locked up the starting job. He isn’t likely to hit .340 for the rest of the season, but his average is not as inflated as it might appear. He is also currently sporting a .397 OBP and a .571 slugging percentage, meaning that he is not simply getting lucky hits. He is making solid contact and is getting on base. Once his numbers come back down to earth, he will continue to be a strong play at catcher.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>David Freese</strong> <em>3B, St. Louis Cardinals: .333 AVG, 2 HR, 9 RBI (Availability: 30.3 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Freese’s rookie season was cut short due to injury, causing his owners grief because of his productivity. Before he went down, he was sporting a .296 average with 36 RBI through 70 games. This season, he has immediately proven that last season was not a fluke. His average and his .481 slugging percentage are slightly inflated, but his OBP is right where it was last year. Even when his other stats come down, he should still maintain an average around .300 and slug about .400, which any fantasy owner would be delighted with — especially for a player they got off the waiver wire. He does tend to strike out more often than he walks, but you can start him with confidence as long as he continues to get on base.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Kyle McClellan</strong> <em>RP, St. Louis Cardinals: 2-0, 1.89 ERA, 1.26 WHIP (Availability: 79.9 percent)</em></p>\n<p>In three starts, he has racked up 13 strikeouts to just six walks and didn’t walk a single batter in his last start. He has also gone at least six innings in all three starts, which means that he is doing a good job of keeping his pitch count relatively low. In his last start, he threw 94 pitches over seven innings to beat the much more well-known Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>\n<p>He has not faced a particularly tough lineup thus far, but his stats — particularly his WHIP — are in line with what they were when he was a reliever. That means that he most likely won’t start giving up a lot of walks and hits each game and will continue to have success as a starter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Jordan Walden</strong> <em>RP, Los Angeles Angels: 0.00 ERA, 0.84 WHIP, 3 SV (Availability: 16.6 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Walden won’t be available for long, but get him if you can. In only his second professional season, he has 10 strikeouts on just four walks and throws in the high 90s. That kind of power and control is a recipe for success in the major leagues, especially for pitchers in the closer role. He has not locked up the job just yet, but it’s his to lose. His only competition is Fernando Rodney, whose control is spotty at best.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mitch Moreland</strong> <em>1B, Texas Rangers: .313 AVG, .389 OBP, .563 SLG (Availability: 32.4 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Last season, his first in the majors, Moreland showed his power potential after belting nine homers and slugging .469 through 47 games. His slugging percentage has increased this season, suggesting that his power has not left him even though he’s only hit one home run so far.  His average has increased significantly from last season, when he hit .255. I’m not saying his average will remain as high as it is, but if he can keep it above .280 he will be one of the top fantasy first basemen. Especially once he starts hitting the ball out of the park more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em> MLB columnist Joshua Greenberg wouldn’t be available in a single fantasy staff writer league, guaranteed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/","id":3055,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3054,3053,3052],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The 18th Weekly Photo of the Week: “To the Land of Golden Bears”","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Lindsay Gottlieb, head coach of the women’s basketball team this season, announced Monday that she was leaving the program to coach at UC Berkeley.

Their attack is led by Raúl González, who is the UEFA competition’s all time scorer with 71 goals and leads the team in champion league goals this year with five. Raúl González netted against defending champion Inter Milan in both legs of the quarter final, and his clever lob pass set up defensive strongman Benedikt Höwedes for the team’s seventh goal in the two-match series. Prior to that Schalke defeated Spanish club Valencia CF and have allowed just eight goals throughout the tournament.</p>\n<p>But the Royal Blues of FC Schalke 04 have their work cut out for them. Manchester United have proven to be one of the best defensive teams in the world, allowing just three goals in ten UEFA matches this year. Manchester defeated Premier League rivals Chelsea FC in the first elimination round and bested Olympique de Marseille in the round of sixteen. Though scoring has been a problem for the Red Devils, with just 12 goals in the tournament, strikers like Wayne Rooney and Javier Hernández need only the slightest opportunity to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>However, the Germans open the series at home, which could spur them to take an all-important lead heading back to Manchester. Bear in mind that Schalke are without a loss in the competition since day one, when they were beaten 1-0 by Lyon. The Germans have more than earned their place in the semifinals and will be eager to prove it while Manchester will have it all to lose. The match will be televised on Fox Soccer channel at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>FC Barcelona v. Real Madrid CF</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kirk Reed</em></p>\n<p>One of the biggest rivalries in all of sports is under the spotlight during the world’s most prestigious soccer events this year, as FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF face off in the semifinal round of the UEFA Champions League Tournament.</p>\n<p>The first leg of the two-match semifinal series — set for April 27 in Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu — will be the second four matches in three weeks between the two clubs. In a highly anticipated matchup, Real Madrid beat Spanish La Liga for Barcelona to win the Copa Del Rey on a header from forward Christian Ronaldo in extra time last week.</p>\n<p>In manager José Mourinho’s first year with the Spanish club, Real Madrid has played exceptionally well in the Champions League to advance past the round of 16 for the first time in five years. With a potent attack led by Ronaldo and Ángel di María, Real Madrid defeated English club Tottenham Hotspur FC to reach the semifinals.</p>\n<p>Argentine forward Lionel Messi and his teammates have continued their domination on the pitch this season by controlling possession and attacking with patience. Barcelona defeated Premier League club Arsenal and then Ukranian soccer club Shakhtar Donetsk in the quarterfinals to again advance to the semifinal round of the UEFA Champions League, where they lost to eventual champion Inter Milan last year. But the hopeful return of injured Captain Carles Puyol will be crucial to help a banged-up Barcelona defense.</p>\n<p>When Barcelona and Real Madrid take the pitch, the event is more than a soccer match. Two giants of the sport and their communities of dedicated fans clash to decide superiority. With a spot in the finals of the UEFA Champions League at stake, Wednesday’s match will showcase soccer at its finest. The match will be televised on FX at 11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/uefa-champions-league-breakdown/","id":3057,"author":{"id":296,"name":"Kirk Reed"},"related":[3056,3055,3054],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
