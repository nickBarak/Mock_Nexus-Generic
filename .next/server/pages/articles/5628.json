Had fun coloring flower pots and standing in line for vegan ice cream amidst a dazzling bunch of barefoot hippies? Earthing (walking barefoot everywhere at all times for a closer spiritual and physical connection to Mother Earth) is one of those trends that provokes either love or hatred. One might go as far as to say that nothing has incited as much  Gaucho trash talk since the debate about the correct pronunciation of our favourite cafe.

Everyone says bare feet are more prone to infections, but no one thinks about the detrimental health effects of shoes (unstable ankles and joints, blisters and deformed feet). Researchers are now </span><a href=\"https://dermalmedix.com/walking-barefoot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saying </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that earthing may be just as good for your body as it is for your spirit. Yet, for most of our generation, shoes seem to be first and foremost about style rather than comfort, let alone orthopedic concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, even if it’s healthy, are there any educational or recreational benefits? This is not at all about what y’all are thinking: kinky sexual fetishes. At least not for all of us earthers. Instead, it is a search for universal human happiness. Ask yourselves: Have you recently spent a shoeless afternoon in the park with your loved ones? Have you ever driven a stick shift barefoot? Ever cracked open a cold one with your toes? Alright, alright, maybe not all of that, Mrs. Grundy. But at the end of the day we can agree that the best thing about shoes is taking them off once you get home. I was told it’s almost like the getting-rid-of-your-bra sensation: Freedom, comfort and protection by and through your bare body.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not only about liberation, though. Earthing is about the awareness of human waste, cigarette butts and broken beer bottles on the street. At the same time, we are all equal (or equally gross) without shoes as opposed to the luxury, high prices and social pressure associated with them. In many cases, there might be a pinch of arrogance involved with feeling alternative and good about yourself because no one else does it. But just imagine a world where we’d all do it. Without any artificial feet protection, we would naturally care more about hygiene and pollution and less about looks or material beauty because our health would be dependent on a clean environment.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                                                                  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a study abroad student, my attitude towards dress, and particularly footwear, in I.V. is similar to performing at drunken Wednesday karaoke nights at Rockfire. There’s room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares. And this is not just due to favorable geographical conditions of beaches, fields and forests. It is because of UCSB’s liberal student body, the fact that there are surfboard racks in front of residence halls and people wearing flip-flops to class. With no snow and little rain, there is no better place to bathe in the alleged acceptance of earthing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing haters usually base their arguments around comfort, hygiene and looks. Granted, the library is a sacred space of learning and reflection for some of our fellow humans. But then, how is earthing different from unpacking your smelly Subway meatball marinara sub in the eighth floor quiet rooms? Once your interpretation of personal freedom infringes on someone else’s, asking politely for permission is in order, whether it’s fast food or your extremities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And seriously, how are bare feet really that different from bare hands? Are we having a glove debate too? I doubt it. This hints at the importance of social constructivism regarding the norms and shared societal expectations of “civilized” behaviour. This is not to demand all-out nudity but to provide some impetus to think about the boundaries we have created. Essentially, we give behaviour and style meaning through our everyday discourse and the persistence of unquestioned traditional taboos. Let’s just forget about the whole shoe madness for a second and take off our fussy socks, both physically and mentally.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages students and staff to think beyond socially-constructed boundaries and choose nature over materialism.</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88168\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88168\" data-attachment-id=\"88168\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/argument-in-the-office-is-barefooting-an-acceptable-practice/shoes-nexus-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=650%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"shoes-nexus-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88168\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shoes-nexus-01-e1557941813452.png?resize=650%2C366\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88168\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>No Such Thing as the Right to Bare Feet</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Kat Chen</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My opponent Mr. Ahrens has given not only his opinion but has also slipped in gentle words of insidious guidance towards this Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile practice. Simon hails from Göttingen, Germany by way of England. His year of exchange in the U.S. gives him, in his own words, “room for experimentation, openness and risk because in the end, no one cares.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I care, Simon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hobbesian ideals of human freedom locked so seamlessly into our revolutionary founding texts lure millions of hopeless romantics like Simon to see this country as a land of exploration. I am tired of white men frolicking through Isla Vista barefoot like the world is their backyard: it began with Columbus, with Lewis and Clark, with Neil Armstrong. The set of soil-crusted toenails perched next to my ear in Pollock Theater is new wave Manifest Destiny. But these “earthers” do not explore uncharted waters or unknown lands. They are not lunar heroes of the Cold War. They are only the disciples of a false gospel, victims to their own disgusting faith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much ink has been spilt lauding the joys of being barefoot. On a hot day in mid-July, I can imagine plunging my feet into the beachy banks of a quiet lake, my toes wiggling through the baked surface to reach the wet sand underneath. On an endless stretch of grass, I see myself prying off both shoes and socks, lying down and letting scratchy sprouts envelop me, head to toe. In the tenderness of my own home, I will sit, criss-cross applesauce, nothing between my soles and the green plush of my carpet. The simplicity of these pleasures must be the source of inspiration for earthing. My sympathies end there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon argues that I have caved to the “norms and shared societal expectations of ‘civilized’ behaviour.” He has basically called me, and all of us who wear shoes, sheeple. While I am supportive of Simon’s angsty nihilism and general call to arms for anarchy, let us lead the revolution shoed. There’s a reason we cyberbully flat-earthers, climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers: for the good of the herd and for the safety of future generations, we must uphold truths that serve to propel progress. Shoes protect us from tetanus, I.V.’s balmy 42-degree weather and street vomit from last Thursday. They act as a buffer between the outside world and the inside, marking clear boundaries between where public spaces end and personal ones begin. The eschewing (e</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing? Ha!) of these thresholds is a privilege exploited by the barefoot of Isla Vista. Most of the responses to my post on our Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page seeking earthers were written by, you guessed it, white students. Remember: “No Shoes, No Service” does not apply equally to all who roam shoeless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthing’s health claims, based on the alleged power of electrons from the ground to counteract the body’s free radicals (to treat anything from depression to cancer), cling to studies like</span> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one from 2012, co-authored by Stephen Sinatra, a co-author of “Earthing: The Most Important Health Discovery Ever!” by Clinton Ober, Sinatra and Martin Zucker. Despite the study’s complete ignorance of “correlation does not equal causation,” earthing is now a small empire, with a vast offering of official Earthing® products targeted towards its cult of believers. Yours for the hot deal of only $69.99, the Earthing Wearables Kit comes with, unbelievably, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">socks</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For your feet. To wear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The claim that earthing is “the most important health discovery ever” isn’t doing wonders for its reputation either. To prove their proclaimed faith to revert to a Paleolithic age, I invite earthers to renounce all modern medicine: the smallpox vaccine, the MRI, even their eyeglasses. If they can’t read the slides, maybe they’ll stop attending my lectures. Maybe then the calloused, punctured, reeking, selfish symbol of American liberty will finally stop encroaching on my minimal expectations of personal freedoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, I would never get into your car if you insisted on driving stick shift barefoot.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick scroll through the Urban Outfitters’ website initially yields nothing new: overpriced sparkly party frocks, BDG mom jeans and those ugly FILA sneakers for which I can’t bear to jump on the bandwagon. But suddenly I do a double take when I click on the ‘Wellness’ section and see a host of vibrators, dildos and other various sex toys placed innocuously underneath the ‘Self Love’ division. A look at the Free People website reveals the same, albeit more expensive, result. Owned by the same parent company, Anthropologie, this sudden movement of younger-skewed brands to start marketing sex toys to a strongly feminist, sexually liberated generation smells strongly of bullshit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex-positive feminism is nothing new — it has been a movement embedded within the feminist community since the early 1980s. However, it seems that late Millennial and early Generation X women were swayed by the heavy presence of pornography-friendly sites like Tumblr in adolescence, leading to a positive outlook toward sex — notably masturbation and an emphasis on female pleasure. These early steps of social media sex positivity have led to a wide variety of successful multiplatform sex-themed websites and podcasts, including </span><a href=\"https://killerandasweetthang.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killer and a Sweet Thang</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guys We F****d </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHOREible Decisions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: all outlets where female-centric, queer-friendly and “taboo” sex practices take center stage. The demographic for brands like Urban Outfitters and Free People experienced a social media-induced sexual awakening in the mid-2010s that led to the radical conclusion that hey — maybe female pleasure isn’t such a big taboo after all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the onset, it seems great that mainstream companies like Urban Outfitters and Free People are jumping at the chance to support female sexuality. But after a closer examination, I am hesitant to buy into the free love narrative fed by a company in which only </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/01/urban-outfitters-board-women/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the executive board is comprised of women. Maybe I’m just jaded, but for some reason, I am reluctant to believe that a bunch of older men of the Urban Outfitters board are super on board with the narrative of women loudly and proudly owning their sexuality. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.

In 2010, Urban Outfitters published a picture of an already tiny model in a slouchy v-neck emblazoned with the phrase </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/09/15/how-urban-outfitters-trades-on-moral-outrage/?utm_term=.b9282110ad07\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“eat less”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and have since been embroiled in </span><a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/480961/15-urban-outfitters-controversies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several scandals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> involving accusations of racial insensitivity, cultural appropriation and downright theft. Free People has additionally been accused of </span><a href=\"https://www.today.com/style/free-people-accused-appropriating-native-american-culture-festival-line-t85821\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appropriating</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Native American culture for festival lines. When major clothing companies don’t care about being socially, culturally or racially sensitive, why would they suddenly flip the script and support what has been a sexual taboo for generations? They’re simply just looking to turn a profit.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urban’s long and arduous list of scandals in juxtaposition with its sudden jump to selling vibrators, lube, whips and other bedroom-related products reeks of performative wokeness. Why would a company so notoriously nonchalant about apologizing for wrongdoings care about anything beyond their brand’s profit? When searching for products concerning one of the most intimate facets of a woman’s life, it seems illogical and counterproductive to patronize a brand that values business over people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a whole host of feminist companies that have been in the business of supporting female sexuality long before big companies sought out to capitalize on the “trend” of female pleasure. </span><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good Vibrations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been a trailblazer in the industry, operating since 1977. </span><a href=\"https://www.babeland.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babeland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has been around since 1993, is wholeheartedly committed to sex education and community involvement.

Those in search of DIY orgasms would have to drive to a sex shop situated in a strip mall on the opposite side of town and peruse the aisles with eyes averted from the other customers, paying cash at the register to avoid a paper trail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, all that shame and secrecy has flown out the window. Just this past year, millions of fed-up women </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/13/metoo-impact-hashtag-made-online/1633570002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weaponized a single hashtag</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to rewrite the rules of a convoluted sexual landscape. Buzz words like “empowerment” and “sex-positivity” represent the current iteration of feminism to which millennials subscribe. The feminists of 2019 sport “Pussy Power” buttons on their backpacks. They skip brunch to attend women’s marches. They open up about their sexuality not only to their closest friends but to their Twitter feeds as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they shop for sex toys not in a dimly lit hole in the wall, but in the wide-open, colorful paradise of Urban Outfitters. Thanks to this mainstream retail outlet and its new collection of </span><a href=\"https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/self-love-products\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“self-love” products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, female pleasure is just as accessible as a ’90s-inspired slip dress or a coffee table book of dad jokes. Featuring items such as bath bombs, “sex dust” (whatever that means) and emoji-shaped vibrators, the line advances an indulgent, pleasure-centered understanding of sexuality that “empowered” women are demanding in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though these products may not be direct political statements, their arrival in the midst of a feminist revolution is no coincidence. Urban Outfitters is just one name in a long list of companies that have capitalized on hot-button social issues in recent years. Through ad campaigns like Gillette’s “</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Best Men Can Be</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and Nike’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lomlpJREDzw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colin Kaepernick commercial</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, brands have attempted to align themselves with the political sensibilities of their consumers. Many of these campaigns have received backlash from news and social media critics who believe corporations should not be hailed as trailblazers of activism for nominally supporting social causes in order to sell razors or basketball shorts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is true that brands are profit-driven and don’t always follow their activist lip service with donations to causes or specific calls to action. These criticisms carry heavy weight at a time when Americans are becoming increasingly fed up with our country’s Machiavellian, profit-driven economic system. Among 18 to 29-year-olds — the demographic to which Urban Outfitters caters — </span><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approval ratings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of capitalism have plummeted by 23 percent in the past eight years.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as much as we hate the system, we must acknowledge that companies are meeting disillusioned shoppers in the middle by infusing a much-desired sense of meaning into the matrix of material consumption. According to a </span><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/championing-change-in-the-age-of-social-media/#Key-Findings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two-thirds of Americans believe it’s “important for brands to take public stands on social and political issues.” Right now, consumers are demanding more than just products; they hope to spend their hard-earned money on symbolic representations of their deeply held beliefs. Gillette no longer sells razors; they sell a positive and healthy form of masculinity. Nike no longer sells sneakers and basketball shorts; they sell a bold commitment to racial equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality. Yes, this statement is undoubtedly motivated by profit. But it is a statement nonetheless, and a positive one at that. The </span><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of masturbation are numerous; the activity is known to reduce stress, improve sleep quality and improve body image, just to name a few.

I also knew it would come with some changes — but that was the point. I wanted change. I wanted exposure to new people and new experiences. I had a serious lack of Vitamin D, and I was sick of having conversations with people who thought building the wall was the solution to all of America’s problems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. Despite there being too many conservatives, having to scrape ice off of my car everyday before school in the winter and OSU fans dedicating their lives to football (because, let’s face it, there’s not much else to do), I still love Ohio. No matter how much I wanted to leave, and how happy I am to be in sunny and liberal California, nothing ever compares to home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

It has also made me turn my head and laugh quite a few times when I see t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he accuracy in my preconceived notions and stereotypes of Californian culture before I moved here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my first day of school, I rode my bike to campus and saw more bikes and skateboards than I’ve ever seen in one place at a time. People don’t skate where I’m from because it’s too cold or rainy, and people don’t bike because there aren’t enough bike paths. We love to drive everywhere — so environmentally conscious! I was a little nervous seeing so many bikes in one place — I even crashed into another bike while attempting to turn into the HSSB — but that’s beside the point. Everyone was in good shape, peddling or skating and making their way to class. Wow — environmentally friendly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> active. Check that off the unconscious list of stereotypes I keep in my head about Californians.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I walked into one of my first lectures, a feminist studies class. My professor started out by asking us what is making us mad in this world where climate change, income inequality, religious conflict and so many other pressing issues drown our hopes for the future. For almost two hours, people raised their hands expressing their fury about our president and the inequalities millions of disadvantaged people face in this wack system that we call America. People are woke here. Another check off of my mental list of Californian stereotypes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another class, my professor came to lecture with wet hair from a surf sesh he hit right before class and drank green juice. Check. My TA for another class skated to section and wore backwards hats and muscle tees a little too often.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely would not find this in Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another new concept that I’ve gotten acquainted with since moving here is astrology. An overwhelming amount of people that I’ve met at UCSB believe in it wholeheartedly. My family and friends at home would laugh if they knew how many times people have told me, “Oh, you’re a Leo. It totally makes sense.” Or: “You should look at careers that fit your astrological sign. I’m a Gemini and we’re supposed to be really good communicators, so I’m majoring in communication.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family and friends at home would laugh if they knew how many times people have told me, “Oh, you’re a Leo. It totally makes sense.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time, I even had a Lyft driver who, within the span of 10 minutes, described how his planetary alignment was off because “Mercury was in retrograde,” and because of this, he had been microdosing on shrooms all weekend. This was my ride back to the dorms after going home for winter break. It was the perfect paradoxical transition to being back in California from Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting adjusted to new faces, classes, neighborhoods and scenery, California has become hard not to love. Although my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clichéd </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">image of everyone being a free-spirited hippie and having a good time lounging in the sun has been proven true at times, I can’t dismiss the actual issues that surround millions of people in the state of California</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Wildfires, an infeasible cost of living and racial and income inequality engross the lives of California natives everyday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is easy to recognize and laugh at all of the stereotypical images people at UCSB have done a wonderful job portraying, it is important to acknowledge what goes on beyond the fantasized idea of living in California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, moving to California has been an eye opening experience, not just in self-discovery, but a deeper look into the world and lives that surround me.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Maybe the EDM music, overpriced avocado toast and hot yoga obsession is a little over the top at times, but overall the progressive atmosphere and unique people that I have met has made it easy to adjust to my new home.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler thinks that California and UCSB live up to the stereotypes.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/","id":5626,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[5625,5624,5623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Freshman’s I.V.

Don’t sit on the curb. </span>I literally can’t repeat this enough.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to avoid walking through Anisq’Oyo Park (the big park in the middle of the loop) by yourself in the dark as there are very few lights along the paths and it is not a very populated area. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of the fact that you go to school in literal paradise; take a walk down to Sands Beach for the most spectacular sunsets or look out for the many public gardens and orchards throughout Isla Vista.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t try fitting more than two people on the electric scooters or try doing any funny stunts — you’ll just look like an idiot. There is also the distinct possibility of one of you cracking your head open as well. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that it’s one mile from one end of Del Playa to the other, so don’t skip leg day in the weeks leading up to Deltopia.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living in I.V. is the best, but only when you are picking the right roommates. There is no need to rush into signing a lease this early in the year. A lot of people will encourage you to sign leases as early as October, but worry not, things always work out. Also, sometimes living with strangers can be one of the best decisions you make!</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Co-op and I.V. Market are great places to swing by in a hangry emergency but don’t rely on them for your everyday grocery shopping.
