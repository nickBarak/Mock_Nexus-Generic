The Gauchos were slow to start and allowed Hawai’i to take the first set, a problem that they have consistently struggled with this season.</p>\n<p>Not daunted by this early lead, UCSB came back strong and showed its offensive dominance in the second and third sets. Licht made his presence known, recording 22 kills, the most of any Gaucho so far this season and one off his own personal best.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about getting in a rhythm and being confident knowing that we were the better team,” Licht said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos took a dramatic lead in the third set, at one point dominating the Rainbow Warriors 13-3. When they fell this far behind, Hawaii’s Head Coach Charlie Wade made a n interesting call and pulled all the starters, allowing them to catch a break before the fourth set. The Gauchos would finish this set with an impressive hitting percentage of .647.</p>\n<p>Despite their performance in the second and third set, the Gauchos encountered a roadblock in the fourth when the rested Hawai’i bench came out fighting. The Rainbow Warriors were victorious, sending the game to five.</p>\n<p>“It was the smartest move that anyone has made in a long time and it worked because they came back in game four and got us,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “We just had to regroup, we knew it was going to be a battle.”</p>\n<p>The fifth set remained relatively close as both teams traded points back and forth. The Gauchos held a 12-11 lead before Hawai’i had two straight attacking errors, putting UCSB at match point. The Rainbow Warriors fought back making it 14-13, but a block by sophomore setter Jonah Seif would end the match at 15-13.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s strong offensive performance was apparent in the numbers, with four different players hitting double digits in kills that night.</p>\n<p>“We adjusted our scouting report a little bit, but we knew that if we just played hard and executed that we were the better team and that over time we were going to win,” Licht said.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, a night earlier, the Gauchos were equally as victorious taking down Hawai’i 3-1. This game was especially important because the Gauchos were able to break the trend of slow starts and get a win in the first set.</p>\n<p>In this match the Gauchos had seven service aces to Hawaii’s zero, and out blocked the Rainbow Warriors 12 to 7.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos extended their series win streak over Hawai’i to seven games, and they now hold an impressive 5-1 record at home.</p>\n<p>“A 2-0 week is always awesome. We have two down days to rest up and get ready to go and play USC,” Licht said.</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays USC on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/ucsb-defeats-hawaii-twice-at-rob-gym/","id":5265,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5264,5263,5262],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson","biography":"Not available","articles":[595,5066,5085,5112,5113,5114,5115,5116,5117,5118,5119,5217,5219,5230,5231,5232,5233,5234,5237,5238,5239,5240,5241,5242,5254,5258,5259,5260,5263,5264,5265,5266,5267,5269,5287,5289,5290,5291,5292,5295],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host First Place Cal Poly in Blue-Green Rivarly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-VBall-Shaminder-Dhindsa.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-VBall-Shaminder-Dhindsa.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball preview vs. Cal Poly","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team finishes off a three-game home stand this weekend with the season’s first installment of the blue-green rivalry.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter Saturday’s game with a 6-8 overall record and at 1-1 Big West mark.

While she has consistently led the team in kills, Sully’s temporary move to libero comes at a crucial time during the season as the team continues searching for answers in their rotation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a bummer not having [Leah] hitting because she’s such a great asset to the team, but she’s doing a great job at [playing libero],” Thompson said. “She’s been one of our big hitters this entire year, so that definitely puts some pressure on the other outside hitters who are filling her shoes.”</p>\n<p>That pressure didn’t seem to faze the Gauchos’ hitters in their dominant victory over Irvine last weekend, as they finished off an astounding .394 percent of their kill attempts. Behind a strong team attack, five players end up with five or more kills, the most they’ve had in any three-set game this season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had to be more balanced,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’ve played an extremely tough schedule and [gained] a lot of experience from that. ”</p>\n<p>The players most responsible for filling in for Sully as outside hitter are freshman Ali Spindt and sophomore Ali Barbeau, who had 26 and 20 kills, respectively, in the two games last weekend.</p>\n<p>“They’re doing really well,” Thompson said of the other outside hitters. “They’re young so they don’t have as much experience as Leah does but they’re definitely stepping up.”</p>\n<p>Thompson continues to dominate the position with a team-high 3.46 kills per set, well ahead of Sully’s second-highest of 2.47.</p>\n<p>The rival Mustangs were able to do what UCSB couldn’t do and defeat the 19ers last weekend.

The match against UCLA was their first road game of the season and it was apparent that the Gauchos were not ready for the change of environment. The game against UCI, which was at home in Rob Gym, exemplified a strong comeback performance by UCSB as Santa Barbara came back from a 0-2 start to lose 3-2.</p>\n<p>“It would be huge for us to get the first win to start with; we are not even going to worry about the second night yet,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “That first night we have to come off our last loss and show that we are ready to play again.”</p>\n<p>In the third set against UCI, the Gauchos rallied for a comeback by making some changes at the service line and at the net. They came out serving the ball aggressively and found their blocking rhythm in the middle. In order to be victorious against Hawaii this week, a similar level of play will need to happen, but this time it needs to be demonstrated early in the game rather than in the third or fourth set. The Gauchos have struggled with slow starts this season, with similar situations occurring in the Stanford, UCLA and UCI games.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s team is well rounded this year, there are specific players that have especially stepped up in the past few games. Junior outside hitter Austin Kingi is one to watch on offense, currently leading the team with 56 kills. Kingi recorded a season high 17 kills in UCSB’s last game against UCI.</p>\n<p>“Austin has been a huge part of our success; he has been the steadiest guy on the entire team night in and night out,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>Another key to UCSB’s success this season has been its strong presence at the service line. Seif leads the team with nine service aces, and Kingi follows close behind with eight of his own.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors will enter today’s match riding the momentum of a three game winning streak, currently sitting at 5-2 overall and 3-1 in conference. They recently beat Long Beach State in five and swept UCSD in a two-game series.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been watching film all week and keying on their tendencies,” Seif said. “We know they are a strong serving team so we have been getting a lot of passing reps in. We know who they like to set and have been doing drills to replicate their offense.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior middle blocker Taylor Averill had a successful series against UCSD for the Rainbow Warriors. Averill had only one hitting error in both games and hit .708 while averaging 3.0 kills and 1.50 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>“The good part about it is the first match for us is Thursday. We have had four days to prepare for one team, which is rare in our league,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is scheduled to play Hawaii today and Friday at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53788\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53788\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/no-9-ucsb-hosts-no-11-hawaii-in-pair-of-matches/","id":5263,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5262,5261,5260],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Between Three Gauchos: The Interview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nexus Sports Sits Down With the Middle Blockers of the UCSB Men’s Volleyball Team","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Standing at 6’9”, 6’7” and 6’6”, this trio of middle blockers is full of interesting personalities and charisma on and off the court.

We had the whole paintball course just for the team. That was pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>Hardy: I will change mine to our trip to Hawaii last year. We beat them in both games, and then we celebrated as a team afterwards. We were a lot closer after that trip.</p>\n<p>Thompson: My favorite experience would probably also have to be Hawaii last year. So much fun!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If you could select one of your teammates to trade lives with for a single day who would you be, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Hardy: I would be Weston Nielsen, because he is so attractive.</p>\n<p>Staahl: On the volleyball court I would be Evan Licht because I have always wanted to play opposite.</p>\n<p>Thompson: I would pick Matt Hanley because his personality is crazy, he is a pretty cool guy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What do you think about Weston Nielsen’s hair?</strong></p>\n<p>Hardy: Well, he hasn’t washed it in over a year … but for some reason it still looks pretty good.</p>\n<p>Staahl: He goes in the ocean a lot, I guess that is supposed to be good for your hair. I think his brother has better hair than Weston, much more flowy. His is a little bit curly for my taste.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What do you love most about the sport?</strong></p>\n<p>Staahl: I like volleyball because it is so rewarding, it’s just so fun to be responsible for getting a game point, whether that is from getting a block or a kill. It’s also really cool because it’s a team sport and your teammates are equally as responsible for getting those points.</p>\n<p>Hardy: Yeah, at the end of each point you are always coming together to celebrate either something your teammates did or a point you scored yourself. That is definitely the best part.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What do you think about Wilson from Castaway, aka the most famous volleyball of all time?</strong></p>\n<p>Hardy: Our thoughts on Wilson? If he were actually a person, I would like to play volleyball with him. He seems like a good guy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What is your personal theme song?</strong></p>\n<p>Hardy: (busts into song) “I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the mannnn” by Aloe Blacc.</p>\n<p>Staahl: Hardy, that was a cop-out answer…</p>\n<p>Thompson: Easy, “I Want to Be a Baller” by Lil’ Troy.</p>\n<p>Staahl: I am going to go with “The World Should Revolve Around Me” by Little Jackie. It’s groovy, and it’s funny because it’s a woman who sings the song.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If you could pick one Chipotle topping to describe you, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p>Thompson: The black beans, just because.</p>\n<p>Hardy: I would be the guacamole … because everyone wants me, but not everyone can afford me.</p>\n<p>Staahl: I would be pico de gallo because I’m not too spicy, and I get along with everybody.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What are your career goals after UCSB?</strong></p>\n<p>Staahl: I definitely at some point want to be working at a company doing some software stuff, ideally my own company … but at some point it would be cool if I could play volleyball overseas. I know no matter what, I have my degree. I am not relying on professional volleyball, but the experience would be amazing.</p>\n<p>Thompson: Maybe I will go overseas to play volleyball, or maybe I will continue on with schooling. I haven’t thought that much about it yet, I am just excited for the rest of my time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Hardy: I agree with them, if the opportunity presents itself I want to go overseas to play. Not for the money, but because I have always wanted to travel. When I come back, I have always wanted to open a winery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If you were stranded on an island with Head Coach Rick McLaughlin and could only bring one thing what would you bring?</strong></p>\n<p>Hardy: I would bring a boat … to take us both off of the island.</p>\n<p>Staahl: I don’t know? Maybe a volleyball, we could pepper or something. Actually no, I would bring some golf clubs. We could hit some balls together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What is one thing that you individually hope to accomplish during the rest of this season?</strong></p>\n<p>Hardy: Personally, I just want to prepare myself better as a leader on the court. I am still a younger player, and that is something that comes with experience. As far as team goals … I just want us to go all out in playoffs, and give us the shot that we deserve at a national title. When we play consistently we are unstoppable, and everyone else knows that too.</p>\n<p>Staahl: I want to be the best middle in the league. That might be a little ambitious, but I figure that ambitious goals are better than practical ones.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of being the best, how does it feel to be No. 1 in the nation right now? Are people chasing you down for autographs yet?</strong></p>\n<p>Staahl: It feels great, no autographs yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, when I say Northridge and Long Beach you say…</strong></p>\n<p>Staahl: We won.</p>\n<p>Hardy: Wait what, Staahl?</p>\n<p>Staahl: I meant to say we are going to win…</p>\n<p>Thompson: I don’t think what I want to say is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Hardy: Go Gauchoooooos!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of Feb. 12th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/between-three-gauchos-the-interview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/between-three-gauchos-the-interview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/between-three-gauchos-the-interview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/between-three-gauchos-the-interview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/between-three-gauchos-the-interview/","id":5264,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5263,5262,5261],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
