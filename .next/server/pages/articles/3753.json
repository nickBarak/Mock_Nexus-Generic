Looking back on their campaign platforms, we asked our elected officials to tell us about their successes and shortfalls throughout their terms in office.</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Only months after taking office, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) Neha Nayak and her office were hit with a massive “curveball”: President Trump’s election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It changed the course of how my office and UCSA and USSA wanted to steer our general goals,” Nayak said. “Essentially, now it was like, ‘We have to protect our students, and we have to protect individuals on campus that are threatened by our new federal government.’”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In response to the election, Nayak prioritized students who were directly affected by taking “preemptive measures,” including lobbying with other EVPSAs to ensure that UCs become sanctuaries.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77399\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77399\" data-attachment-id=\"77399\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-external-vice-president-of-student-affairs-neha-nayak/as-nayak-candidate-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=1343%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1343,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS-nayak-Candidate-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77399\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7-672x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C915\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"915\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1 164w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1171&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?w=1343&amp;ssl=1 1343w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77399\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">However, despite this shift, Nayak was still able to make strides in increasing mental health resources and the creation of the Federal Advocacy Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We really wanted to have an advocacy program that in a sense doesn’t just reach out to students in A.S. but to individuals that are not necessarily involved in student government, but that have these stories that can be an interesting and compelling story for a federal legislator,” Nayak said. “So if we go to, like, a representative, a congressman, you know, having someone that personally has dealt with being a refugee is more compelling.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program launched earlier this year. According to Deputy Chief of Staff Maya Halthore, 60-70 students applied and 40 were able to go to Washington D.C. with USSA in March to lobby for Pell Grant expansion and protection, increased financial aid and DACA protection for undocumented students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Nayak also focused on mental health through Chai Talks and a S.T.E.M. mental health panel.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“In terms of Chai Talks, I think it’s important to have a space on campus where students can speak on islamophobia, parental pressure, just things South Asian students, things that are related to their communities specifically, and I think that has been something that has not been spoken of or vocally emphasized” Nayak said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also takes pride in her S.T.E.M. mental health panel, which just started this quarter. She described it as a “working group” that meets every quarter to ensure that students within S.T.E.M. programs are aware of mental health resources.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I did what I wanted to do,” Nayak said, but she still wishes she could have done more regarding tracking legislation and voter registration.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Having a lot more internal communication with other entities that are already doing voter reg. is very important, and I could have improved on that,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said that she wished she had further increased student outreach to ensure that different students and “young student leaders” are applying to attend various conferences instead of the same people going multiple times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristin Hsu, the EVPSA chief of staff, also believes there are things that could have been done better.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Not everyone’s perfect, and I think Neha knows she’s not perfect,” said Hsu. “I think we could have done more outreach; we could have perhaps recruited more student leaders within the office; we could have gotten more staff members in the office … I think as long as you are constantly trying and making those efforts to do that outreach and go to meetings, to advertise whatever opportunities you have, you are doing your job.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s hard, because EVPSA is such a broad scope,” Nayak said. For the future, she hopes that the next EVPSA can create an easily accessible bill tracker to make students aware of legislation that may affect them.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite the setbacks, she is leaving behind a positive legacy with her staff.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I loved working with Neha. Obviously, entering EVPSA, there were bumps in the road with all of us, but Neha consistently served as a positive force within the office, being encouraging and present,” said Halthore.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As a graduating senior, Nayak looks toward a future away from politics, likely in marketing. She said, “maybe in the way future, [she’ll] run for office, for, like, state congress, but not anytime soon, that’s for sure.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite her reluctance to go into politics, she believes her experience working within A.S. and as EVPSA will guide her in her life.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“That’s something I’ll take for the rest of my life: just the knowledge of knowing how to be involved in these different communities, help these communities on campus, attend board meetings all across the state, fly to D.C. to advocate for issues that are so important to students and are essentially the lifeline of students. That has been such a growing experience for me. I wouldn’t trade it for anything else for my senior year.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She parted with some advice for future EVPSAs:</p>\n<p>“There will be ups and downs, but learn from the failures and learn from your experiences because that’s what makes you a better elected official, and in the end, you’re there for the students. You chose to run because you wanted to help UCSB students; keep that in mind when things get hard.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Despite his slight build and young face, he seemed to be highly confrontational and looked to be itching for a fight.</p>\n<p>Before he could find that perfect someone, though, he ran into I.V.’s finest. The officers asked the pugnacious punk his age and he truthfully replied that he was 15.</p>\n<p>The officers saw that the 15-year old kid, who was in town visiting his brother, was carrying a backpack and asked him what was in it. He told them, “It’s just water in there. You can search it if you want.”</p>\n<p>The officers, not wanting to refuse an invitation, opened the bag and found an open, nearly empty fifth of Taaka Vodka.</p>\n<p>Upon seeing the deputy remove the alcohol from his backpack, the young gun quickly retorted, saying “Hey! How’d that get in my backpack? I was only carrying water. They must have put that vodka in there.”</p>\n<p>Not caring to get to the bottom of this case, the officers cited the young whippersnapper with a minor in possession, as well as being out past curfew, and released him to his brother, pending harsher punishment from his mother.</p>\n<p>Shrubbery Showdown<br>\nFri., May 16, 12:18 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Pasado Road witnessed a man ungracefully weaving in and out of foot traffic.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the young man that many of his fellow Friday night revelers stopped and watched him as he attempted to walk down the street.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he also drew the gaze of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, who stopped the unsteady stroller.</p>\n<p>A deputy advised the 18-year-old male that he was very intoxicated and told the tipsy trotter that he wanted a word with him. The intoxicated male attempted to say something in return, but his words were completely incoherent.</p>\n<p>The officer sat the tongue-tied man on the curb, but he immediately fell backwards into a rather large bush. Sitting back up, the drunkard attempted to say his name but once again could not be understood.</p>\n<p>Fearing words wouldn’t get them any farther, the deputy asked if the man had ID. The drunk managed to answer “no.”</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked the man if he could walk home, and received a “yes” in return. Yet when he attempted to stand up, gravity won the battle and the drunk found himself back in the bushes – and into a pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>While awaiting his trip to the jail at the IVFP substation, the man had more issues sitting, this time mistaking a trashcan for a chair. Luckily he was too drunk to be embarrassed, and was eventually transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Two Cups, One Hangover<br>\nSat., May 17, 5:19 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to the 6500 block of Cordoba Road on reports of a subject trying to gain entrance to an apartment complex.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived on the scene a few minutes later and went around to the back of the apartment complex, where they found the 19-year-old perpetrator hunched over a large puddle of his own vomit.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the defeated reveler where he was and he answered by saying his last name aloud. His answer was the same when asked where he was from.</p>\n<p>Hoping for a different answer, the deputies asked him where he was once more, and he incorrectly told them “Del Playa.” Not a bad guess, they conceded.</p>\n<p>Next on the list of questions was his date of birth, which the drunkard told the officers was “six, six.” The deputy then asked how much alcohol he had consumed and he said, “two cups.”</p>\n<p>Comfortable with their decision, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16908\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16908\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-21/police-blotter-25/","id":3752,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3751,3750,3749],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
