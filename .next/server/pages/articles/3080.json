If passed, the money would go toward providing new equipment, more content and covering of travel costs. The fee, which is one of two new A.S. lock-in fees being voted on this election, would go into effect next fall and be subject to reaffirmation every two years.</p>\n<p>Domenighini said the lock-in fee might also allow for more compensation for writers and editors to offset recent pay cuts.</p>\n<p>“One of our biggest setbacks is that we had to considerably reduce the amount of money that staff members are being paid,” Domenighini said. “So every staff member saw their paychecks go down very considerably. Editors had … the amount of money that they’re making reduced by over half.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, TBL was allocated $12,000 from A.S. for honoraria earlier this year, and covers a large portion of its printing costs through grants the staff applied for. However, Martinez said some of these grants may not be available next year, and the paper needs a more stable source of funding in order to continue to cover costs.</p>\n<p>Though the fee initiative failed to pass last year, Domenighini and Executive Content Editor Kelsey Gripenstraw said they remain confident it will pass this year, considering it fell short of the necessary 50 percent majority of 7,100 voters by only a couple hundred votes.</p>\n<p>“Our promotional campaign … wasn’t as strong as previous years,” Domenighini said. “Last year we really ramped that up, so I think the number one factor that we were facing last year was just that people didn’t really know who we were, so they were probably voting for a lock-in fee [when] they didn’t really know, exactly, what the publication was going through.”</p>\n<p>According to Gripenstraw, TBL’s weekly publication is not likely to change regardless of whether or not the initiative passes, but they may be forced to work with less if the measure fails. However, she said having more than one campus news source is important for the university and their readership.</p>\n<p>“We value having multiple media sources on campus, because think about how the United States would be if there was one source of media. It would be insane,” Gripenstraw said. “Like, you can’t just rely on one news source for the entire school, especially with a school as huge as UCSB. So we’re here just to provide another voice.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 10 of the April 18th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3080,"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky"},"related":[3079,3078,3077],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky","biography":"Not available","articles":[3006,3080,5989,7004],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Associated Students COSWB Holds Event to Promote Improvement of Student Diets","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Commission on Student Well Being is hosting a lecture and dinner in the Loma Pelona Center this evening to inform students about healthy eating habits.

Exercise and Sports Studies professor Art Gilbert and Isla Vista Food Co-op kitchen manager Madia Jamgochian will be speaking and food will be provided by the I.V. Food Co-op.</p>\n<p>According to COSWB External Coordinator Diane Byun, certain foods available to students can be deceptive in their nutritional value and can cause problems for students who do not realize that they are not getting the nourishment they need.</p>\n<p>“Our initiative is healthy eating, especially in the campus community because when you live in the dorms, you’re so enticed by the cereal and ice cream,” Byun said.  “Even if you’re an inhabitant of I.V., you aren’t surrounded by the healthiest food. Things that you think are healthy might actually be bad for you, and this event is closing in on this problem.”</p>\n<p>COSWB Chair Lisa Schwartz said the event is designed to give students multiple ways to examine the serving sizes and types of foods they consume in the hopes that they will see how important it is to maintain a balanced diet.</p>\n<p>“I hope that students will learn easy and efficient ways of eating healthy as well as the basics of what healthy eating encompasses,” Schwartz said. “We will be providing healthy sandwiches, wraps and vegetables from the I.V. Co-op to demonstrate that healthy food can be simple and delicious.”</p>\n<p>According to Byun, Gilbert’s lecture is expected to address the scientific aspects of nutrition and make students aware of the technical facets of eating a balanced diet.</p>\n<p>“It’s sort of what you would see on the nutrition facts label of a cereal box, but wrapped up in a lecture with his own twist to it,” Byun said.</p>\n<p>Jamgochian said her time at UCSB provided her with personal experiences that will allow her to relate more closely with the students in attendance and demonstrate how crucial a balanced diet is to general health and well-being.</p>\n<p>“I went through a lot of the same things that the students are going through right now.  I want to offer my experience with food and the effect stress has on the food that we choose to eat,” Jamgochian said. “Some things that I will talk about are digestive illnesses and overloading sugar intake that most people do not realize.”</p>\n<p>The lecture will also address the issue of dieting and the long-term ineffectiveness of these types of eating strategies.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to listen to your body and to be healthy on an overt level without focusing on dieting for a week.  It’s more about the whole picture,” Jamgochian said. “If you try to diet for a couple of weeks, you might be successful in losing a couple of pounds, but in the long run, you’re going to gain it all back and it won’t be helpful to your body at all.”</p>\n<p>The event will begin at 7 p.m. and include a raffle for gift cards to the bookstore to encourage students to ask questions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the May 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/associated-students-coswb-holds-event-to-promote-improvement-of-student-diets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/associated-students-coswb-holds-event-to-promote-improvement-of-student-diets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/associated-students-coswb-holds-event-to-promote-improvement-of-student-diets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/associated-students-coswb-holds-event-to-promote-improvement-of-student-diets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/associated-students-coswb-holds-event-to-promote-improvement-of-student-diets/","id":3077,"author":{"id":196,"name":"Tiffany Park"},"related":[3076,3075,3074],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Legal Code. Under Legal code, a simple majority is 50 percent of Senators plus one, not counting abstentions — meaning that passage of the resolution would have required a “yes” vote from 13 of the 23 senators present (rounded up from 12.5).</p>\n<p>Authors of the resolution said they sought to incorporate critiques of the original document — “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid” — in their revisions and hoped that Senators would note the changes. University Owned Senator Miya Sommers said she believed the revisions made the resolution more neutral and less divisively worded.</p>\n<p>“This resolution — there’s a lot of changes into it. We definitely took all of the criticisms,” Sommers said. “This resolution is not taking sides; it’s not saying that we have an idea of what we want to happen around the issue. We, instead, are just asking for our school to not be involved.”</p>\n<p>Student sponsor and third-year political science major Katlen Abuata said the resolution did not intend to attack Israel itself but instead aimed to pressure the state to end certain policies.</p>\n<p>“What we’re doing here is not questioning the existence of Israel because we don’t want to do that at all. We don’t delegitimize the state of Israel,” Abuata said. “We are asking you to recognize that there are human rights violations and that there are students on this campus who feel uncomfortable with that.”</p>\n<p>Anti-divestment speaker Liran Braude said he did not believe the underlying intent of the resolution changed with the revisions.</p>\n<p>“This has become more than a little bit ridiculous,” Braude said. “The entire student body’s resources, time and money are being spent so that one group can attempt to force their own personal political complaint on the Senate, at the expense of another group on campus. The bottom line of this resolution has not changed at all.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Ben Green said he rejected the idea of the resolution’s “neutrality.”</p>\n<p>“It keeps being said that this isn’t taking a stance, and that this won’t be alienating people,” Green said. “It creates a controversial issue and a climate where people don’t feel safe.”</p>\n<p>Senators also touched on a number of arguments discussed in previous meetings such as impact of the decision on the campus climate, which communities would feel marginalized and what financial impact the resolution would have on UCSB. Following a heated debate over what constitutes a majority vote, Segovia announced her decision in tears, apologizing to anyone who would feel hurt by the defeat.</p>\n<p>In response, A.S. President Sophia Armen encouraged students to maintain civility when deliberating on sensitive issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re all still people, we’re all still students and it’s disheartening to see how much anger, how much pain, can be inflicted on each other,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also began a discussion on the budget for the 2013-2014 school year, which was tabled last week due to a controversial vote on the divestment issue and was supposed to be finalized by the end of Wednesday’s meeting. Members of the Queer Commission, Human Rights Board, A.S. Food Bank and other groups presented defenses for funding requests, but the Senate ultimately decided to extend the budget deadline for one more week in order to more thoroughly examine each Board, Committee and Commission request.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1649098816\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51321\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51323\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/a-s-senate-meeting-fails-to-pass-revised-divestment-resolution-with-close-votes/as_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51323\" alt=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

Senators proved responsive to students who lobbied at the meeting, adhering more closely to requests from student groups who spoke in public forum such as Queer Commission and Womyn’s Commission.</p>\n<p>For most allocations, Senators allocated an amount of the funds between the proposed budgets of A.S. Finance Board and the A.S. President. However, the organizations S.C.O.R.E., S.I.R.R.C., Student Lobby and Human Rights Board were given more money than either Finance Board or the President suggested.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed revisions to the A.S. Election Code, as well as the legality of Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia’s interpretation of the legal code at last week’s meeting regarding divestment from companies that profit from the military occupation of Palestine.</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan addressed public forum in defense of the organization’s requested allocations. Agazaryan said she was disheartened by the substantial cuts made to all of the Boards, Committees, and Commissions as opposed to other entities in light of the budget restrictions.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a little bit ridiculous that BCCs are bearing the brunt of it,” Agazaryan said. “Senate, you hold a lot of power, but again, the BCCs is where it’s at.”</p>\n<p>Queer commission member James Neally said the need for increased LGBTQ education within the UCSB community is critical, especially in regards to the current campus climate.</p>\n<p>“Everything that Queer Commission does is very important to all the students here,” Neally said. “Even today there’s problems with people on our campus and a lot of education that needs to be done still.”</p>\n<p>Representatives from both Queer Commission and Womyn’s commission pointed towards the annual publication of Herstory! — a magazine that aims to give a voice to underrepresented minorities — as an important budget item.</p>\n<p>Representatives from various other organizations also presented in defense of their budget requests during public forum including the Student Commission on Racial Equality, Rally Commission, the Offices of the Student Advocate General and the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and Take Back the Night.</p>\n<p>Senators spent several hours discussing each item on the budget individually, and eventually reached a consensus, which was approved at 6:02 a.m.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also touched on the AFSCME protest of the Regents Meeting, the Elections code, and whether or not Segovia had acted in accordance with the legal code when she decided that 12 votes did not constitute enough of a majority for last week’s divestment resolution to pass. Segovia asserted that although she may have been mistaken in her logic, she had been correct in her interpretation.</p>\n<p>A motion was made to officially reconsider the chair’s decision, but the action was voted down.</p>\n<h6><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"166327550\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51439\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51436\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/panel-debates-ethics-of-drone-warfare-at-campbell-hall/web_senate_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51436\" alt=\"WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></h6>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>During Wednesday’s Associated Students meeting, senators took 12 hours to vote on the A.S. budget for the 2013-2014 school year.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/","id":3079,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3078,3077,3076],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
