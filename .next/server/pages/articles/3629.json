On Wednesday, the UMC’s Judicial Council — the church’s highest court — held a hearing in Memphis, Tennessee, to determine whether or not a lower appeals court acted properly in restoring Schaefer his reverendship status in June of this year. The prosecuting clergy member in Schaefer’s case, the Rev. Christopher Fisher of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, brought an appeal to the Council in July, stating, among other reasons, that the lower appeals court “wrongly crafted” its own penalty rather than “remanding” it back to the trial court to determine the penalty.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council’s final decision was announced on its website yesterday morning and states that the church’s Jurisdictional Committee on Appeals operated accordingly in its decision to reverse the lower court’s penalty on Schaefer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The Judicial Council … finds there are no errors in the application of the church law and judicial decisions,” the UMC press release stated. “The penalty as modified by the Committee on Appeals stands.”</p>\n<p>Schaefer said he is grateful to keep his status as a reverend.</p>\n<p>“I feel relieved. For me and my family, it’s a great relief,” Schaefer said. “Today is a very, very good step.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista pastor said he regards this decision as a major victory not only for himself, but also for the LGBTQ community.</p>\n<p>“Justice was not denied today,” Schaefer said. “It feels good because justice has not always been done to the LGBT community.”</p>\n<p>Bishop Minerva G. Carcaño of the Los Angeles Episcopal Area said she was pleased with the final decision made by the UMC Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“I rejoice in the decision of the Judicial Council in the case of Rev. Frank Schaefer,” said Carcaño. “I believe it affirms our United Methodist commitment to doing all the good we can in the name of Jesus our Lord.”</p>\n<p>Carcaño said she believes the ruling opens the door for Schaefer to further his ministry in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Already Rev. Schaefer’s ministry is bearing much good fruit in Southern California,” said Carcano. “The Judicial Council decision now frees him to continue the work of making disciples of Jesus for the transformation of the world.”</p>\n<p>According to Schaefer, the ruling will allow him focus more on his ministry at University United Methodist Church.</p>\n<p>“Now I will have the opportunity to really devote myself to Isla Vista,” Schaefer said. “I have such a big heart for Isla Vista, and I really want to help to create healthy, good structures and good community.”</p>\n<p>The LGBTQ-friendly pastor said he has a message to individuals who feel that the council made the wrong decision.</p>\n<p>“Deal with it,” Schaefer said.</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Rev. Christopher Fisher was not available for comment.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

In addition to being dubbed Nobel laureates, Nakamura, Akasaki and Amano will receive equal portions of $1.1 million in prize money. Nakamura and other Nobel recipients, not including the Nobel Peace Prize winner, will travel to Stockholm, Sweden, to receive their award on December 10. The rest of the Nobel Prize award winners will be announced later this week by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>The early morning celebration for Shuji Nakamura was short but sweet. Umesh Mishra, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, received a call at 2:45 a.m. from Steven DenBaars, who shares the title of co-director of the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/phosphor-analysis-could-improve-led-efficiency/\">Solid State Lighting &amp; Energy Center</a> with Nakamura at UCSB. By around 3 a.m, the three had convened in a campus parking lot with a bottle of non-alcoholic apple cider to toast the most recent achievement of Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nowadays, we can buy energy efficient LED light bulbs at the supermarket and help reduce energy use. I hope it helps to reduce global warming too. —Shuji Nakamura</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nakamura was born and educated in Japan. After graduating from the University of Tokushima, he went to work at Nichia Corporation, where he, Amano and Akasaki developed the blue LED, before coming to UCSB in 2000.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56630\" style=\"width: 238px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"92824741\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56636\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56630\" data-attachment-id=\"56630\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/ucsb-professor-shuji-nakamura-wins-nobel-prize/shuji-nakamura-nobel-prize-winner_10-07-2014_john-clow-07/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?fit=980%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"980,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412679040\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Shuji Nakamura Nobel Prize Winner_10.07.2014_John Clow-07\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?fit=204%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?fit=836%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07-204x250.jpg?resize=228%2C279\" alt=\"Shuji Nakamura Nobel Prize Winner_10.07.2014_John Clow-07\" width=\"228\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?resize=204%2C250&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?resize=836%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 836w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?w=980&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56630\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nakamura speaks with journalists after the conclusion of the press conference, which was held at the Engineering Sciences Building on UCSB campus. <br><em>(John Clow/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Nakamura said at a press conference this morning that he was excited to be honored for the invention.

Both of those inventions relied on his breakthroughs.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>This Nobel Prize … underscores the paramount importance of research conducted at the University of California.

Eliason also said the woman was struck and killed at the scene and that a male member of the group suffered severe injuries to the head and chest and was airlifted to the trauma center at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. A second female also suffered moderate injuries to the head and chest and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital by ambulance.</p>\n<p>Eliason said that people who approach train tracks should use caution and minimize their time on the tracks because modern trains make less noise.</p>\n<p>“Trains these days are a lot more efficient and a lot quieter than they used to be,” Eliason said. “They can come up on you quickly and you might not realize it until its too late.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason the train was traveling at track speed, between 50 and 60mph, when it approached the group and that the engineer sounded the horn upon seeing the group but was unable to stop the train in time.</p>\n<p>Due to privacy laws, the names of the three victims and the fourth group member who was a witness have not yet been released. According to Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, the Sheriff’s Office is working with the Chinese consulate and UCSB to notify the next of kin of the deceased.</p>\n<p>Vista Point is a popular turn out for California tourists along Highway 101 and is located approximately 20 miles northwest of campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/","id":3628,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3627,3626,3625],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
