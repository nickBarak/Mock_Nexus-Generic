The task force will oversee efforts made system-wide to prevent sexual violence and will allow various UC campuses to share effective practices in regard to sexual assault prevention, response and education.</p>\n<p>According to UCOP spokesperson Dianne Klein, the formation of the task force was not mandated by the policy update, but came directly from Napolitano.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence is a serious crime that we will never tolerate,” Napolitano said in a statement. “The mission of this new task force is to continue to review and improve our efforts to make sure the University of California employs innovative, evidence-based and consistent practices across the system.”</p>\n<p>The task force is comprised of 23 individuals from nine undergraduate campuses and UCOP, — including three UC Regents — and will meet via teleconference every two to three weeks and twice a month in person in July and September. A report regarding the task force will be presented to the Regents during the upcoming July 16-17 meeting.</p>\n<p>According to Ricardo Alcaino, Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, while each UC campus is unique and has different needs to consider when responding to sexual assault, some standardization throughout the UC system is “still feasible.”</p>\n<p>“Having some minimum requirements around education for incoming students, ongoing education throughout a student’s time on any campus, and on-campus advocates for survivors could be some areas where campuses could be held to the same standards,” Alcaino said in an email.</p>\n<p>The task force could also create “meaningful change” if it lead to the establishment of some standardization of guidelines for sexual assault response for students, staff and faculty, according to Alcaino.</p>\n<p>“There simply cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this work,” Alcaino said in an email, “but having resources that campuses can share and use is a reasonable goal for the Task Force.”</p>\n<p>According to Jill Dunlap, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education and Women’s Center programs, UCSB’s GauchoFYI program is a good example of a practice that could be shared with other campuses via the task force.</p>\n<p>“[It] is a stellar example of collaboration among different departments, including the CARE program,” Dunlap said in an email. “We think requiring first-year and transfer students to go through comprehensive, in-person alcohol and sexual violence prevention programming within their first six weeks of school is important.”</p>\n<p>Alcaino also said the collaboration between CARE and the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment has “proven to be an effective model for the [UC] system to emulate.”</p>\n<p>Savannah Badalich, a fourth-year international development studies major at UCLA and one of two undergraduate students on the task force, said despite her excitement over the “freaking amazing” formation of the task force, more student representation is needed.</p>\n<p>“There should be more students,” Badalich said. “I was kind of hoping that there would be one [student representative] from each school … this is a student issue, there should be a student majority on that task force.”</p>\n<p>Bailey Loverin, third-year literature major and Associated Students Student Advocate General, also said there should be more student involvement with the task force.</p>\n<p>“I’m also concerned about the apparent lack of student feedback on this task force … [four] student voices is not enough here. The UC system has over 200,000 students. You can’t simplify that to [four] representatives,” Loverin said in an email. “I’d like to see at least two reps from each school, preferably representatives nominated by their student body.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the number of student voices on the task force, Klein affirmed that students are represented and said for any task force to be effective it “can’t be too large,” although she could not comment on the how the members of the task force were selected.</p>\n<p>Badalich also said she hopes the task force will recommend additional funding, particularly for mental health resources for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>“What students need are resources, especially mental health resources … that is stuff that requires money,” Badalich said. “That’s sort of the factor. You can say all you want in support of a cause, but if you don’t give money towards it, it doesn’t mean crap. So we’ll see, I hope one of the recommendations will be giving funding.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Wednesday, June 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article identified Jill Dunlap as the director of the Women’s Center for Sexual and Gender Equality.

Also at the meeting, outgoing executive officers offered their reflections on the year and advice for their replacements. As of press time, new senators and executive members had not yet taken their positions.</p>\n<p>Many members of Student Lobby said they felt the process did not take into account the requests of the group, despite acknowledging the potential for collaboration and improvement. During public forum, Student Lobby co-chair Maria Flores said she believes issues could be resolved in manner that involve more student input.</p>\n<p>“We feel that there could be a more inclusive way to go about it,” Flores said. “We don’t negate the fact that student lobby could be changed for the better.”</p>\n<p>Current EVPSA Alex Choate read a letter from the 2011-2012 EVPSA Ahmed Mostafa in favor of the bill, which stated that the bill would help to create a “strong coalition between Student Lobby and EVPSA.”</p>\n<p>During A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s report, he defended the bill on the basis that many other UC campuses function with a stronger relationship between the EVP and the Student Lobby group, and that the EVPSA had always picked the chair until two years ago. According to Abboud, the change came as a result of personal vendettas within the association, rather than necessity.</p>\n<p>“The External Vice President used to pick the chair of Student Lobby, and then Ahmed won and they didn’t like him so they changed it,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Andre Theus, author of the bill, reported to senate that Student Lobby was unhappy with its unexpected and sudden timing and requested that the bill be pulled. However, he also said he recognized some ways the bill would benefit the organization.</p>\n<p>Second-year Student Lobby member Mohsin Mirza said he did not agree with the concept of allowing senators to significantly change a group that they were not directly involved in.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very dangerous precedent for students to restructure something who have not been involved in this,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Some Senators said they did not agree with the process of drawing up the bill, but did support the notion of creating a stronger coalition between the office of the EVPSA and Student Lobby.</p>\n<p>Senator Nick Onyshko said there should be more consideration for the solidarity of A.S. as a whole.<br>\n“It’s a little concerning to hear rhetoric such as autonomy…when we are one association,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>The bill passed with 12 votes in favor, 6 against, and 4 abstentions.</p>\n<p>As the process of swearing in new executives began, protesters from the Coalition for Survivors silently held up signs condemning administration and campus organizations for allegedly failing to address accusations of sexual assault made by second-year global studies major Crystal Long on April 23 against incoming External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, outgoing executive officers spoke about their experiences in office and offered words of advice.</p>\n<p>Abboud advised incoming officials and senators to treat each other with kindness, disregard party politics as much as possible, and keep overarching, long-term goals in mind.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be mean, don’t be petty towards each other. Don’t let party politics takeover A.S,” Abboud said. “Be mindful when you’re making decisions…we can’t lose sight of tuition increases becoming real.”</p>\n<p>Outgoing Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet devoted her time to thanking the senators, her co-executives and the A.S. staff members for supporting and accompanying her throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Outgoing EVPLA Alex Moore told incomers to remember that their actions will affect future generations of students.</p>\n<p>“Remind yourself that you’re laying down the tracks that the next generation will follow,” Moore said. “If you take yourself seriously … then you will be taken seriously.”</p>\n<p>Choate echoed Abboud’s plea that new elected officials remain respectful of each other, and advised them to stay true to their opinions.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said senators should make an effort to consider opposing opinions and listen to those that they disagreed with.</p>\n<p>“Take into consideration what the opposition has to say,” Whittaker said.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, senators passed a resolution opposing hydraulic fracturing, and decided to pull a bill that would have restructured the legal code for A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_55474\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbOPP/posts/588512774581425\">The Open People’s Party</a></strong> rescinded Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs-elect Beatrice Contreras’ party membership and requested her resignation last Friday in light of sexual assault allegations directed at her on April 23.</p>\n<p>Despite OPP’s decision, Contreras is under no obligation to step down from her position and has said she does not plan to do so. However, a petition circulating now would force a recall election if signed by ten percent of the students who voted in last month’s election for the EVPLA position — a total of 514 signatures — in accordance with Associated Students <a title=\"A.S. Election Code\" href=\"http://www.as.ucsb.edu/elections/_downloads/elections-code-2014.pdf\"><strong>Election Code</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>OPP’s statement and the petition came in response to a <a title=\"Long's blog post\" href=\"http://coalitionforsurvivorsucsb.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/dear-ucsb-community/\"><strong>blog post</strong></a> by second-year global studies major Crystal Long concerning an alleged incident of sexual assault perpetrated against her by Contreras. Contreras, who was in the midst of her campaign when Long’s blog post went public, responded in a <strong><a title=\"Google cache of Contreras' blog post\" href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pzKp3bSzrREJ:justiceintruth.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/the-truth/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">blog post</a></strong> of her own, but removed it only hours after posting.</p>\n<p>According to Contreras, a third-year sociology and Asian-American studies major, OPP’s decision to proceed with the statement without consulting her or having all party executives present invalidates their request and undermines the party’s democratic process.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote\">“Requesting the resignation of an elected official as a party is frankly ridiculous and sets a dangerous precedent,”</span> Contreras said in an email. “Party leadership said they would not take any immediate action without consulting me, and not all party executives were present when the decision was made.”</p>\n<p>However, second-year political science major and OPP Party Chair Derek Wakefield said although not everyone chose to speak, a sufficient number of party members came to a consensus to make the party’s actions legitimate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people, not the execs essentially, had opinions and voiced them, and there were discussions and arguments on either side,” Wakefield said. “Eventually it came to the point where one person said they wanted to vote.”</p>\n<p>Wakefield said this consensus was reached because party members recognized the importance of supporting sexual assault victims.</p>\n<p>“When it’s said that way it makes it very clear that we are advocates for survivors of sexual assault,” Wakefield said. “We are staunch opponents and attempters to revise and end rape culture.”</p>\n<p>However, Long said OPP’s decision was merely a political move to protect their party reputation rather than a stance against sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I think the bigger concern with them, to be completely honest, is just to save face,” Long said. “They let go of Beatrice, so they stopped supporting her. So in the end, who do they support? It’s really just themselves.”</p>\n<p>Contreras agreed with Long’s criticism of OPP’s motives and said the statement was not issued out of respect for victims of sexual assault but to preserve the party’s standing.</p>\n<p>“They were concerned about attempts to remove me from office because it could damage me and the party’s reputation,” Contreras said in an email. “The party seems concerned with its image far more than anything else.”</p>\n<p>Contreras also said OPP’s decision was not legitimate due to the pressure that those in the majority placed on other members, and that she is being singled out only because of the public nature of the allegations made against her.</p>\n<p>“I know individual party members who don’t agree with what happened and felt coerced into voting a certain way,” Contreras said in an email. “Crystal is right that I am not the only member to be accused of sexual assault, but I am the only person being removed because of it. … I am being attacked because people are afraid to support me.”</p>\n<p><em>Peter Mounteer contributed to this article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55367\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55367\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/opp-calls-for-contreras-resignation-from-evpla/","id":3013,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3012,3011,3010],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Safe & Sound: Isla Vista Plans to Improve Public Safety","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Public Safety Commission held a public safety meeting in Isla Vista Theater yesterday where attendees discussed ways to improve safety and quality of life in Isla Vista.  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students Public Safety Commission held a public safety meeting in Isla Vista Theater yesterday where attendees discussed ways to improve safety and quality of life in Isla Vista.<br>\nA.S. Public Safety Commission Chairperson and third-year biology major Molly Morrison organized the event in hopes of bringing Isla Vista residents together to brainstorm ideas to enact safety reform in I.V. The students who spoke at yesterday’s meeting, all of whom expressed that they were impacted by Friday evening’s tragedy, voiced that I.V. culture needed to be directed in a positive direction in light of recent events.<br>\nMorrison opened the meeting by describing A.S. Public Safety Commission’s involvement within the I.V. community. Following Morrison’s brief introduction, audience members were given the opportunity to address others in the audience.  According to Morrison, the event was primarily aimed to educate students about what public safety resources were available to them and what avenues were available for getting involved with public safety in I.V.<br>\n“I think a lot of students came to the meeting tonight not knowing what Public Commission was or did at all or what resources they had in the community and in A.S.,” Morrison said. “I think our community came together tonight with a bunch of great ideas and I hope we can move forward as group dedicated to improving Isla Vista.”<br>\nFirst-year computer engineering major Robert Stosick presented three ideas at the meeting to prospectively improve safety in I.V. such as the installation of a siren system, a gunfire locating system such as ShotSpotter — a program that installs dozens of sensors in an area in order to immediately relay gunshot locations — and emergency phone stations throughout I.V. However, Stosick was uncertain the ideas introduced by him and others would reach fruition.<br>\n“I would like to think the ideas brought up by all of us tonight will be taken into consideration, but I do not know if these ideas can be carried out because Isla Vista does not have its own form of government and is entirely dependent on outside entities,” Stosick said.<br>\nMorrison also said all audience suggestions would be taken into consideration, including better fencing along the bluffs of I.V. and a possible I.V. community center.<br>\n“It is hard to say what is practical right now as Isla Vista is not a self-governing body, but I think we can take it upon ourselves to improve fencing conditions,” Morrison said. “I also think it is possible for us to take an existing building and create a community center building.”<br>\nAccording to Morrison, another public safety meeting is in the works and any students interested in I.V. public safety can check out the “UCSB AS Public Safety Commission” Facebook page.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-30/safe-sound-isla-vista-plans-to-improve-public-safety/","id":3014,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[3013,3012,3011],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
