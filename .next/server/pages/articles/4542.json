Hopefully being at home will be the advantage for us.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly began its Big West schedule last week with a 2-1 outing against UC Riverside at home, but lost to San Francisco 4-0 in the Bay in nonconference play on Tuesday. After losing their first six games of the season, the Mustangs went 10-8 and currently own a 10-14 overall record. UCSB is 10-13 against Cal Poly, but the Mustangs have not beaten UCSB in a series since 2009.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I don’t think it’s an advantage [to have already played Big West games],” senior right-hand pitcher Jesse Meaux said. “The important thing is we’ve been playing tough teams and that’s what matters. [It’s about] the level of competition we get before conference.”</p>\n<p>Meaux, 2-2 on the season, will start in the series opener this Friday. Meaux has a 4.06 ERA and has struck out 18 batters during nonconference play. He will try to add to that tally when he pitches against a familiar face on the Cal Poly squad: Mustang junior outfielder Bobby Crocker.</p>\n<p>Crocker and Meaux were teammates this past summer on a Cape Cod summer league squad. Crocker currently holds the second-best batting average for Cal Poly with a hitting percentage of .337.</p>\n<p>“[Crocker] is a good hitter, but there’s going to be a lot of good hitters in the Big West,” Meaux said. “We just have to execute our pitches. It’s really important to keep the ball down, especially against good hitters.”</p>\n<p>Meaux will find support on the mound from a bullpen of relievers that so far have recorded an ERA of 2.62, allowing 48 hits and 13 walks.</p>\n<p>“We utilize our bullpen quite a bit,” Brontsema said. “Part of good relief pitching is having good defense … it’ll give us a better chance of winning.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho pitching rotation will face multiple Cal Poly batters with averages of at least .300. Mustang junior Mike Miller’s .386 average is currently the best in the Big West, although he has not accumulated enough at-bats in his 17 games to officially be considered for the category.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, senior second baseman Sean Williams anchors the Gauchos offense. Williams’ .382 batting average is second behind Miller’s in the Big West, while his .551 slugging percentage tops the conference. Senior right fielder Mark Haddow bats .325, holds the conference’s second-best slugging percentage behind Williams (.542) and leads the conference with four triples. Senior first baseman Trevor Whyte has reached base in 19 straight games.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s pitching staff has been revamped from last year’s squad with the addition of senior right-hander Steven Fischback, who is recently returning from an injury that he obtained after going 5-4 in 2008. Mustang junior right-hander Jeff Johnson — Cal Poly’s main closer — led the team in strikeouts with 53 last season and is expected to see time on the mound this weekend as well.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ series against Cal Poly will begin at 3 p.m. today at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

With a man on second, senior third baseman Beck Wheeler drove in the first run with an RBI double. After LMU walked the next batter, senior catcher Dan Camou capitalized, driving in two runs with the Gauchos third double of the inning.</p>\n<p>“We put a three-spot on the board and we got back in the game, so I was pleased with that,” Brontsema said. “[LMU] really didn’t make too many mistakes and they played really well.”</p>\n<p>The Lions quickly responded however, adding a pair of runs in the sixth inning before UCSB scored its final run in the seventh inning on senior outfielder Ben Edelstein’s double play.</p>\n<p>“It was only 4-0 in the third inning and we still had a lot of baseball to play,” Wheeler said. “We tried to make it a competitive game and put together some hits, but we fell short.”</p>\n<p>LMU junior left-handed pitcher Ryan Hawthorne closed out the game for the Lions, picking up his eighth save of the year and securing the victory for sophomore righty Aaron Griffin.</p>\n<p>“I feel like our energy was a little low early in the game,” Wheeler said. “We played better later in the game but we just couldn’t catch the breaks.”</p>\n<p>Camou and Wheeler each had multi-hit games for the Gauchos, but it was not enough to overcome the Lion’s fast start.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home on Friday after five games on the road to take on San Jose State in a three-game series. The Spartans currently stand at 16-7 on the season, winning four of their last six.</p>\n<p>“They are a very well coached team, pitch very well and play really good defense,” Brontsema said. “We are going to have our works cut out for us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Gauchos Return Home</p>\n<p>Taking the mound for the Gauchos on Friday will be senior right-handed pitcher Jesse Meaux.

For some clubs, it is a bitter, uncomfortable feeling, like in Boston and Atlanta.

Here are the four biggest questions and storylines heading into the Major League Baseball season.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1.

Kendry Morales is on fire this spring training, and if he can consistently produce behind Pujols then Pujols will be worth every penny of that $250 million. The addition of CJ Wilson on the mound can only help the Angels’ already stellar starting rotation.</p>\n<p>Staying in the American League West, the Rangers filled the hole left by the departure of CJ Wilson with Japanese sensation Yu Darvish. Darvish is a 25-year-old, 6’5, 216 lb. right-handed pitcher. In Japan, he had a record of 93-38 and 1,250 strikeouts in 1,268.3 innings. The Rangers have a stacked offense and if their young starting pitchers like Darvish, Neftali, Feliz and Derek Holland succeed then us baseball fans will have the delight of watching the Tigers, Rangers, Angels, Red Sox and Yankees battle it out in an absolutely loaded American League.</p>\n<p>The Tigers’ signing of Prince Fielder makes them a virtual lock to win the AL Central. Miguel Cabrera and Fielder hitting back-to-back in the lineup will be fun to watch; not so much for opposing pitchers though. Like in Anaheim, Cabrera will have to move to third base, where he played very early on in his career. I highly doubt this will work and Cabrera will likely be a full time DH. Especially after Cabrera wore a grounder with his face and had to get stitches. Either way, Fielder’s big offense is definitely worth the price and he will likely battle Pujols for the AL lead in home runs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Will Carl Crawford improve and play up to his contract?</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the terrible performance of the beer-drinking, video game-playing Red Sox starting pitchers, Boston might have actually made the playoffs if Crawford played up to his abilities. Even with Crawford’s career lows last year (.255 BA, .285 OBP, 18 stolen bases), the Red Sox lineup still led Major League Baseball with 875 runs and 2631 total bases, and their .280 batting average was only 3 points behind Texas for the MLB lead. If Crawford can get it going, Boston’s offense is stacked. I think if Crawford can handle the Boston pressure and play up to his talent, the Red Sox might be able to slug their way to an AL East crown.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. How does the city of St. Louis and the Cardinals rebound from a World Series win without Tony La Russa and Albert Pujols?</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you cannot simply replace Albert Pujols, the best offensive player in the game. However, what will help is the return of starting pitcher Adam Wainwright, who was injured last season with a torn elbow ligament. When Wainwright is healthy, he serves as an annual contender for Cy Young. If he and last year’s playoff stud Chris Carpenter can pitch to their capabilities, the Cardinals will be competitive in the National League Central. However, Carpenter went down last week and will not be ready for opening day.</p>\n<p>Losing La Russa might be an even bigger loss than Pujols. La Russa’s sense of his players’ talent and abilities is among the greatest the game has ever seen. La Russa has made a Hall of Fame career out of pushing the right buttons at exactly the right time. Last year he was able to make a mediocre bullpen look elite by carefully selecting matchups and playing the percentages.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Can the Brewers sustain their success?</strong></p>\n<p>With a dynamic duo of high-powered sluggers in the middle of the lineup, a revelation at Closer in the grizzly John Axford and their first division crown in 29 years, the Brewers emerged as the new sexy team in the NL last year. Unfortunately, Prince Fielder is now 1500 miles west in Detroit. Luckily for the Brewers, Ryan Braun just won his appeal for his 50-game suspension, stemming from his postseason positive drug test. He is the first player ever to win his appeal, in which he cited a protocol error by the collector. Their starting pitching is still pretty good with arms like Zack Greinke, Yovani Gallardo and Shaun Marcum, and the addition of third baseman Aramis Ramirez should help Rickie Weeks and Braun sustain their offense. Second year manager Ron Roenicke pushed all the right buttons last year and is certainly capable of coaching this talented roster to another playoff run.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45802\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/mlb-season-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45802\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/mlb-season-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/mlb-season-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/mlb-season-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-04/mlb-season-preview/","id":4540,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[4539,4538,4537],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Baseball Feature: Reliever Earns Spot in Starting Rotation as a Senior","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For senior right-handed pitcher Greg Davis, attending UCSB was never a question.

My parents were never big baseball fans, but they obviously love it now.”</p>\n<p>With a support system established with his parents and teammates at UCSB, Davis has flourished thus far in the season, holding a 3-1 record, three saves and a 2.90 ERA in 31 innings pitched —  the best on the team for pitchers with over 10 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Davis is currently the Sunday starter for the Gauchos after transitioning from the bullpen, where he spent the majority of his career.</p>\n<p>“He’s really done a good job this year with that transition and he has proven himself and earned the spot to be a starter,” senior pitcher Kevin Gelinas said. “He has a great shot to win some ball games for us and be that guy we depend on for us to win the series.”</p>\n<p>After facing a tough preseason schedule, UCSB scraped by with a 12-11 record on the season. Perhaps their most impressive performance thus far was an 8-3 victory over #23 Oregon State on March 27, a game in which Davis received the win after pitching 5.1 innings and allowing no earned runs.</p>\n<p>“In the four years I’ve been here, I’d have to say it’s the best chemistry we’ve had. Everybody gets along really well,” Davis said. “Our chemistry has really helped and going into conference, that is going to carry us a little more.”</p>\n<p>Myers noted that although Davis for the most part is a quiet kid, he also has a fiery side to him.</p>\n<p>“He channels his aggression in the right way, because he is very aggressive when he is on the mound,” Myers said. “His early success has been correlated with that because he goes out and he attacks hitters, and that is a byproduct of why he is doing well.”</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos set to begin conference play this weekend, Davis and the rest of the Gauchos have one clear goal in mind: get to the postseason.</p>\n<p>“I’m in my fourth year here and we haven’t made the postseason yet. That’s really our main focus,” Davis said. “We’re always taking it one step at a time and one game at a time, so hopefully we can make that happen.”</p>\n<p>An economics and accounting major here at UCSB, Davis hopes to continue his baseball career next year in the minor leagues. If not, he plans to follow in his parent’s footsteps and become an accountant.</p>\n<p>“He has command of three pitches and sometimes four. He is a big physical kid, and when pros come to evaluate pitchers, they look for bodies like his,” Myers said. “If he continues to have success in the Big West conference, I feel he’ll get a chance to play at the next level.”</p>\n<p>Clearly leaving his mark on coaches and teammates, Davis appears to be on a path of success regardless of what professional field he chooses.</p>\n<p>Davis and the UCSB baseball team begin Big West play Friday when they host rival Cal Poly for a three-game series. The first pitch is scheduled for 3 p.m. Friday and 1 p.m. Saturday, a game in which Davis is scheduled to start.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-05/baseball-feature-reliever-earns-spot-starting-rotation-senior/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-05/baseball-feature-reliever-earns-spot-starting-rotation-senior/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-05/baseball-feature-reliever-earns-spot-starting-rotation-senior/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-05/baseball-feature-reliever-earns-spot-starting-rotation-senior/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-05/baseball-feature-reliever-earns-spot-starting-rotation-senior/","id":4541,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[4540,4539,4538],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
