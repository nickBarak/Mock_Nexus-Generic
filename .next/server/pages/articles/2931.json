The summit will also include various food-related workshops and activities as well as lectures by speakers such as food justice advocate Nikki Silvestri and renowned chef Crystal DeLongpré, also known as Food Network’s Chef Pink. The event will also feature a screening of “Occupy the Farm,” a documentary following food justice advocates.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen, the summit will allow attendees to become exposed to new ideas, solutions and innovations regarding food distribution and consumption that can prompt others to make positive impacts on the current food system.</p>\n<p>“People are bringing their expertise from projects they’re working on in their own communities and campuses outward so that kind of information can be shared and modeled,” Cohen said. “Because the best thing that can happen in a situation like this is people present projects that can be replicated.”</p>\n<p>According to Tim Galarneau, a member of the advisory board at Real Food Challenge, which is a campaign to shift the way universities source food, the summit is designed to be all-inclusive and allow all attendees to both learn and participate.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to see a cross section of students, staff/faculty, and community partners coming together on MLK weekend to engage in conversations and planning toward bridging access, equity, and justice in our food system,” Galarneau said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Food Bank Chair and event organizer Katie Freeze said she is looking forward to listening to seasoned chefs and food advocates impart their wisdom upon event attendees.<br>\n“Summit participants will have the opportunity to enjoy meals prepared by local chefs, participate in educational workshops and listen to inspirational keynote speakers,” Freeze said.</p>\n<p>The summit will also include a series of talks and workshops designed to help attendees learn more about the food they eat, where it comes from and how to protect and conserve food resources. Workshops such as “Santa Barbara County Food Action Plan and Food Justice: Health, Access, Environment, Labor,” will take place in classrooms on the first floor of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Freeze said she hopes the summit will bring student attention to issues regarding the nation’s currently “broken” food system.</p>\n<p>“The summit’s primary mission is to start a dialogue surrounding food justice and food security in the UC community,” Freeze said, “and to help students realize the role they play in helping to fix our broken food system on a local and statewide level.”</p>\n<p>Keynote speaker Silvestri, who in addition to co-founding food justice advocacy campaign Live Real and directing national clean energy economy organization Green For All also developed a course curriculum for the UC system, has advocated statewide for environmental justice and political ecology programs for the last ten years. Cohen said she is particularly looking forward to the opportunity to hear Silvestri speak and hopes students will take advantage of the opportunity as well.</p>\n<p>“Nikki Silvestri is a huge person who influences me, helping me feel comfortable to have the right lexicon — the right words and the right knowledge — for how to talk about … these issues,” Cohen said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The event will be hosted by Santa Barbara Hacks, a student organization and is sponsored by Citrix, Cisco, Opengov, Microsoft, Intel, Smartstones and Major League Hacking, among others. SB Hacks is co-founded by fourth-year computer science majors Trevor Frese and Anshul Jain as well as third-year computer science major Benji Lampel.</p>\n<p>Geared towards undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. students, the event is free for all participants and will provide participating hackers with free meals. Students with advanced knowledge in computing as well as beginners can attend the event and participants can attend in groups of up to four individuals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing. Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill. – SB Hacks co-founder and fourth-year computer science major Anshul Jain</p></blockquote>\n<p>Frese said the Hackathon will include smaller events to highlight the “Santa Barbara vibe,” such as morning yoga sessions and walks to the beach.</p>\n<p>“There’s a big focus in Santa Barbara on health and wellness as well, so that has been one of our focuses of the event,” Frese said. “Although it is a 36-hour event and it’s stressful for the hackers, we want them to have the right means to stay healthy. We’ve also just added a lot of activities to the event. We have video game tournaments, silent disco and a moonlight walk on the beach.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the team with the most creative and original project at the showcase will win the Grand Prize Bundle, which includes the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 and a $10,000 cash prize. Prizes will also be awarded to the winning groups in various challenges, such as Environmental Hack Challenge, Beginners Hack Challenge and Makeschool Best iOS App/Game Challenge.</p>\n<p>“Some groups work on challenges that they work on assigned by companies, while others come together to work on their own project that you’ve just never had the chance to make,” Lampel said. “At its heart it’s still a competition, and people are still there to compete for prizes. People are still trying to work on something to win, but there are a lot of ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The hackathon will give students the opportunity to develop ideas that they previously had not had the opportunity to create, Jain said.</p>\n<p>“You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing,” Jain said. “Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun. – SB Hacks co-founder and third-year computer science major Benji Lampel</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon will allow student groups to get critique and assistance from mentors hired by the company sponsors as well as to “meld brains with people we would never have met otherwise.”</p>\n<p>“Lots of companies will send mentors who specialize in certain systems,” Lampel said. “Because computer science is such a broad field of so many specific areas of study, it’s hard to teach someone one thing and say they are proficient computer scientists.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the hackathon is open to individuals with advanced knowledge in coding as well as to those with no previous experience in the field.</p>\n<p>“There are people who come to these events to learn how to code and we think that UCSB Hacks is definitely a great place for beginners to come and learn and meet people who are very experienced in the industry,” Lampel said, “but then have the opportunity to work with them also in a very safe cooperative learning environment.”</p>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon aims to highlight Santa Barbara as a location “on the map” of the tech industry as well as to show that it is “just how we do things here.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of starter communities in L.A., San Francisco, Silicone Valley and they’re all very big . . . I think the start-up community in SB is very different from the other places,” Lampel said. “We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

World War 2. <em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter in the Washington bureau of <em>New York Times</em> Eric Lichtblau spoke in Corwin Pavilion Monday night about how America became a safe haven for Hitler’s men in 1969 during the Cold War’s Operation Paperclip.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau presented recently discovered documents that discussed how Nazis were used as spies and scientists by the U.S. military and intelligence services in order to aid the race against the Soviet Union to reach the moon in 1969 via Operation Paperclip. The talk ended with a free book signing in honor of Litchtblau’s latest book entitled <em>The Nazis Next Door</em>, which took place at the entrance of Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>According to Lichblau, despite the American populous’ opposition to aiding Nazis, U.S. intelligence agencies undertook various secret efforts to protect them once they got to American soil.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that Nazis in America were paid with commodities for their work during what he called a “horribly difficult truth” in American history.</p>\n<p>“They were perceived as lazy, filthy, thieves, liars and double agents,” Lichtblau said. “But, they were still used by the U.S. in times of war and were offered packs of cigarettes and alcohol in return.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969 – Pulitzer Prize-winner Eric Lichtblau</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lichtblau, the living conditions of Nazis in America were “shameful” because they were “easily” allowed to live in the U.S. while their Jewish victims “horribly” suffered in concentration camps.</p>\n<p>“The ease of allowing Nazis in America, in my view, is shameful and is a really untold period in postwar history as thousands of Nazis came to America after the war,” Lichtblau said. “It was horribly easy for them to come and horribly difficult for the liberation of Jews in America. I cringe at this sight.”</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that although Nazi scientists aided American scientists in developing technology to go the moon in 1969, their cooperation with the government is considered “horrible.”</p>\n<p>“Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969,” Lichtblau said, “Without them, we realistically might not have entered the moon in 1969,”</p>\n<p>Litchblau also said that there were a few “good” spies that helped the U.S. perform tasks that they could not accomplish on their own.</p>\n<p>“There were some good Nazi spies that translated documents, control zones of Europe, intercepting cables, and doing other tasks that the U.S. could not do themselves,” Litchblau said, “Some of these were anti-Soviet spies whom were rewarded.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S. I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong. – First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Litchblau, the anticommunist sentiments shared by the U.S. and Nazis in America allowed Americans to channel anticommunist Nazi sentiment into work.</p>\n<p>“Anticommunists sentiments were behind the Nazi achievements because the U.S. was against communism and this helped,” Litchblau said. “There was a notion that nobody hated the Soviets more than the Nazis and the U.S. wanted to put this hatred to work.”</p>\n<p>First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim said he was alarmed that Nazis were secretly protected by the American government and that the actions of the intelligence agencies “feels gross.”</p>\n<p>“I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S.,” Jim said. “I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Ashley Miller however said Lichtblau’s talk changed her previously held perspectives on Nazis.</p>\n<p>“Currently knowing that Nazis aided Americans with scientific and spy-related achievements, it helps me to see them as a little less worse than I previously thought of them,” Miller said. “It is mind-blowing to have my perspective change.”</p>\n<p>Psychology professor Kristen Macuga said she was “quite shocked” to learn about Operation Paperclip, since she grew up in the post Pearl Harbor-era where the U.S. was portrayed as heroic in the post-World War II historical narrative.</p>\n<p>“It is quite shocking to know this,” Macuga said. “I was born weeks after Pearl Harbor in a place that made it seem that Americans were heroes who freed Jews from concentration camps. It is shocking to know that we allowed Nazis to aid us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/reporter-lectures-on-nazis-in-cold-war-america/","id":2929,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2928,2927,2926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Event Takes Closer Look at ","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A panel of professors, public officials and graduate students spoke at an event titled ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60040\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60040\" data-attachment-id=\"60040\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/charlie-hebdo_alex-nagase-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?fit=1232%2C816&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1232,816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421953129\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Charlie Hebdo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-e1422289926743.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-60040\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Hebdo_Alex-Nagase-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Guest speakers, including French, Global Studies, and Religious Studies Faculty, a student, and the French Consulate General from Los Angeles, discussed this month’s attack on French satirical newspaper <em>Charlie Hebdo. Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A panel of professors, public officials and graduate students spoke at an event titled <em>Charlie Hebdo: Defending Freedom of Speech and Fighting Islamophobia in France</em> Thursday evening in Buchanan Hall to discuss the ramifications of the terrorist attacks against the French satirical magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> in Paris in early January.</p>\n<p>Sponsored by the French and Italian Department and the Arab Student Group on campus, the event included discussion on the social consequences of freedom of speech, the importance of interfaith dialogue and the political relationship between the West and the Greater Middle East. About 150 students, faculty and campus community members attended, with several audience members participating in a Q&amp;A session later in the evening that resulted in controversial debate.</p>\n<p>French Council General of Los Angeles Axel Cruau led a brief moment of silence to commemorate the 12 people killed in the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> shootings after speaking of the “heroism” displayed during follow up attacks on a Jewish supermarket days later.</p>\n<p>“We also saw in those moments of darkness, heroism, especially in the Kosher market,” Cruau said, “One of the employees, his name is Lassana Bathily, he is Muslim. He came from Mali. He saved hostages.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We may agree or disagree with its editorial policies, but just please remember, silence is the end of democracy. – Visiting Assistant Professor of French Studies Aude Jehan</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cruau said the millions of French people who gathered in unity rallies across the country “did the right thing” by protesting peacefully.</p>\n<p>“All over France, almost 4 million people gave the best answer possible to those terrorist attacks — they stood up and marched,” Cruau said. “They stood up and marched in a show of dignity, of brotherhood, to proclaim their commitment to freedom and to say a resolute ‘no’ to terrorism, to intolerance, to anti-Semitism, to racism.”</p>\n<p>Global studies professor Jan Nederveen Pieterse said geopolitical conflict was the catalyst for the events that unfolded at <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>.</p>\n<p>“Abu Grahib, Fallujah and Israel’s wars in Gaza, mentioned as motivation by the attackers in Paris, were cruel and extreme,” Pieterse said, “and extremists in the region and outside the region have responded in extreme ways, and both are unpardonable.”</p>\n<p>During the event, a slide show of some of <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>’s most controversial cartoons was shown, including one image showing a Nazi SS officer kissing a Hasidic Jew. Visiting Assistant Professor of French Studies Aude Jehan said the cartoon was made to criticize homophobic Nazi ideology and not to defame Jews or homosexuals.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a show of disrespect, but rather it shows a way to resist,” Jehan said. “Never did the publication ever call for any sort of violence.”</p>\n<p>Jehan said even if people are opposed to the content published in <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>, it is freedom of speech should be protected.</p>\n<p>“We may agree or disagree with its editorial policies, but just please remember, silence is the end of democracy,” Jehan said.</p>\n<p>Political Science graduate student Shyam Sriram said despite finding the caricatures of the prophet Mohammed “to be a form of Islamophobia,” that he, “as a Muslim,” was not offended because the Muslim community has far more significant issues to confront regarding human rights violations worldwide.</p>\n<p>“Instead of focusing so much on the cartoons, why don’t we start treating women with respect and dignity, speaking out on child marriage, female circumcision, honor killings and human trafficking?” Sriram said. “How about having an honest conversation about depression, suicide, mental health and substance abuse?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60039\" style=\"width: 476px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60039\"

Paris are not representative of the Muslim community</p>\n<p>“I am proud to be Muslim … and I am ashamed that anyone would pretend to be Muslim and then carry out something so heinous in the name of Allah,” Sriram said.</p>\n<p>Professor of Religious Studies Kathleen Moore said the recent media depiction of a “Clash of Civilizations” has had deep ramifications for intercultural relations between the West and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“Often, unfortunately, when terrorist attacks like <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> occur, the same tired explanations are offered alongside a portrait of Islam and irrational radical Muslim rage contrasted with a rational, balanced pluralist and democratic West,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jessica Baker said the diversity of the event’s panel allowed for dynamic and constructive discourse on issues surrounding the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> incident in Paris.</p>\n<p>“Each different panelist teaches or has a different background and had a completely different perspective or something from history to introduce,” Baker said, “so I think if this school is going to open a dialogue about this, this is the best way to start it.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Primitivo Gonzalez said he it was refreshing to listen to people speak that have a personal connection to the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> events.</p>\n<p>“I’m really glad that we have the French Department faculty members here to give their piece on what they believe about <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> because we’re kind of stuck using American outlets, or BBC,” Gonzaez said. “It’s good to hear a human being that we can possibly relate to, from the local level.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are universal values, and they should be the norm everywhere. As a human being and citizen I hope you will agree with that. – French Council General of Los Angeles Axel Cruau</p></blockquote>\n<p>President of the Arab Student Group Nada Elshaari said it was exciting to see cooperation between two separate campus entities to facilitate a discussion on a current event.</p>\n<p>“Different student organization on campus are really acclimated to activism, so you get a lot of discussions like this all the time,” Elshaari said. “When an event like this roles around, where a student org and an academic department can work together, it’s just a good thing.”</p>\n<p>In a separate interview, Cruau said people across the globe should unite to protect freedom of speech in the wake of the attacks such as the incident at <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>.</p>\n<p>“We really hope freedom of the press will be defended worldwide, and that people will live up to their commitment,” Cruau said. “Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are universal values, and they should be the norm everywhere. As a human being and citizen I hope you will agree with that.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/event-takes-closer-look-at-charlie-hebdo/","id":2930,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[2929,2928,2927],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
