Takeuchi came just above Shofet with 14.88 percent.</p>\n<p>Shofet’s platform in the spring included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“[creating] a L&amp;S Student Council that allows chosen students to act as liaisons between their major departments and their colleagues to vocalize their concerns and needs;</li>\n<li>[reforming] library late-night to include more study spaces as well as textbooks course reserves, whiteboards, and computers;</li>\n<li>[implementing] a women in STEM mentorship program that matches freshmen and sophomores with juniors and seniors who act as personalized peer advisors;</li>\n<li>[executing] a stream-lined research matching program that categorizes available research opportunities to be more accessible on collegiate-wide basis.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shofet also stressed her appreciation for education and her previous experience teaching English to children as well as her time in research labs studying brain sciences.</p>\n<p>While Shofet said she was excited to serve on the Senate, she joked that Ho would have to teach her everything now.</p>\n<p>Takeuchi is the second senator to resign this school year.

Resolution Policy Aims to Protect Students From PTSD Triggers","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Senate and Office of the Student Advocate General are working together to implement a guideline advising professors to alert students of class content that can potentially “t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students Senate and Office of the Student Advocate General are working together to implement a guideline advising professors to alert students of class content that can potentially “trigger” symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in those who have experienced traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse or fighting in war.</p>\n<p>The goal of the policy — enacted by an A.S. resolution passed last week — is to protect students with PTSD who may be harshly affected by content, such as video scenes, and it would allow these students to miss classes containing such material without losing course points. The proposal does not require that professors alter their planned course material, but that they include in their syllabi “trigger warnings” — a term for a warning label on content that might trigger a traumatic response. However, the resolution for the policy only directs A.S. collegiate senators to visit the deans at the three colleges of the university to request the new guideline; thus, the resolution has not resulted in any concrete changes to current university policy.</p>\n<p>As defined by the National Institute of Mental Health, PTSD develops after a “terrifying” incident involving physical harm or the threat of harm and it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents — rape, being kidnapped, child abuse, torture, car accidents, plane crashes, train wrecks, bombings or natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate Chief of Staff Bailey Loverin, a third-year student in the CCS Literature program, introduced the proposal last week at a Senate meeting and explained her personal experiences in classes as the reason behind the proposal.</p>\n<p>“There was absolutely no warning before class that [this material] would be covered,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>Several A.S. Senators, including second-year student Nikki Calderon, immediately jumped on board with the proposal, stating that it will give students “the opportunity to be attentive in their classes and protect themselves.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB has lots of resources, but at the same time they can’t reach you when you’re sitting in a lecture, uncomfortably watching a film,” Calderon said. “If they do need to miss a lecture, they could tell the professor ahead of time and do an alternative assignment.”</p>\n<p>Calderon also said she thinks there might be a correlation between watching violent material and acting violently in real life, however she insisted that she did not believe in censoring that material.</p>\n<p>“T.V. is definitely a factor among children, but ultimately, it’s up to adults to make the right decisions,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has responded positively to the Senate resolution, however. Second-year political science major Jason Garshfield said he was disappointed in the A.S. Senate for passing the resolution, as he said it may hinder the intellectual and emotional growth of some students and that it approaches censorship.</p>\n<p>“The learning process necessarily involves exposing people to ideas that will challenge their beliefs and make them feel uncomfortable,” Garshfield said. “People who attend college are implicitly agreeing to be pushed outside their intellectual and emotional comfort zones … I would like to see the Senate have a higher regard for the fortitude and resilience of the students of this university, as well as the discretion of our professors to teach their students at the level they feel is appropriate.”</p>\n<p>According to professor of English and comparative literature, and Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts, David Marshall, faculty currently tend to warn students if they think certain material might be disturbing. Marshall also said that while he believes faculty should be sensitive to the concerns of students, “thousands of years of art and literature have been provocative and disturbing,” and these works are important because they advance our understanding of social ills.</p>\n<p>“Think of ‘Oedipus Rex,’ which contains scenes of violence, patricide, incest, and death. In addition, there are many works of art, film, and literature that contain disturbing images in order to prevent social ills, such as violence against women,” Marshall said in an email. “Finally, I would note that our university adheres to the principles of academic freedom.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year Asian American studies major Beatrice Contreras said she has an idea of how this resolution could be implemented on campus.</p>\n<p>“Ideally, some professors are already [having these warnings], and are putting in UCSB C.A.R.E. and C.A.P.S. numbers on their syllabi,” Contreras said. “The first step is bringing it to Academic Senate, and they can choose to make it a departmental choice to make it a requirement in that class to warn students.”</p>\n<p>Over time, Loverin aims to make trigger warnings on syllabi a UC-wide policy.</p>\n<p>“[A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs] Alex Choate will introduce this to the next UC government meeting … to make sure this is not just Santa Barbara, but across the nation.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54422\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54422\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/","id":3023,"author":{"id":186,"name":"Jessy Diamba"},"related":[3022,3021,3020],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Senate Discusses Deltopia and Installation of Security Cameras","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The first Associated Student Senate meeting of the quarter focused on a debate over the planned security measures for upcoming Deltopia festivities, particularly surrounding the controversy over recen...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The first Associated Student Senate meeting of the quarter focused on a debate over the planned security measures for upcoming Deltopia festivities, particularly surrounding the controversy over <a title=\"Sheriffs, UCSB Install Cameras Throughout I.V.\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/sheriffs-ucsb-install-cameras-throughout-i-v/\">recently installed public surveillance cameras in Isla Vista.</a></p>\n<p>Senators directed questions about the security measures to External Vice President of Local Affairs Alexander Moore after he provided his executive report to the Senate. Other items discussed at the meeting included the resolution to provide trigger warnings in classrooms to trauma victims that has garnered significant media attention, continuing improvements to the Isla Vista Pardall Center, plans for a professional drag show sponsored by the Queer Commission and confirmation that The Fire Department will be playing at Chilla Vista.</p>\n<p>Moore attempted to clarify police objectives regarding shutting down parties during Deltopia weekend in response to Senator Montana MacLachlan’s question asking what constitutes a “large party” in police terms. He said police personnel are not necessarily focusing on private house parties, but rather are concerned about large-scale, open-house gatherings or on-street crowding of over 500 people that can easily spin out of control.</p>\n<p>“They’re worried about the stuff that spills into the street or is totally public where there is no monitoring of who is coming in,” Moore said. “Those parties that you can just walk into — that’s what they’re trying to aim at, they’re basically trying to shut down stuff like that that’s uncontrolled.”</p>\n<p>Moore also said he advises party hosts to keep their music at relatively low levels to avoid receiving a citation for a noise ordinance violation. Unfortunately, according to Moore, there has been no stated decibel measurement of what constitutes as “low level” noise, so Moore suggests music players adhere to the rules from Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“I would stick to Halloween standards really, to be honest, as a precaution,” Moore said. “They make a judgment call when they decide to give you a ticket like that, so they’re not really able to tell us, which kind of sucks.”</p>\n<p>Moore then addressed concerns over newly-installed cameras in I.V. According to Moore, funds for the cameras were allocated by the university.</p>\n<p>“The security cameras are being paid for and provided by on the request of the university administration,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Senators continued to press for further information about the new surveillance measures. The lack of knowledge revealed that none of A.S. leadership was provided basic details of the new security measures that would be using school resources, such as who would operate and monitor the cameras, their costs or the duration of their implementation.</p>\n<p>Moore said he does not approve of the degree of secrecy with which the new surveillance measures were executed.</p>\n<p>“I think the way they put up the security should be more transparent,” Moore said. “There’s been no P.R. or attempt to explain what was going on… [and] all these things that are supposed to be part of a community discussion just didn’t exist.”</p>\n<p>Senators debated the legitimacy as well as the pros and cons of the new security cameras, with Off-Campus Letters &amp; Arts Collegiate Senator Scott O’Halloran expressing approval of the cameras. O’Halloran cited recent incidents of assault and said the cameras could be a useful tool to track down suspects.</p>\n<p>“Instead of being uncomfortable with people watching you all the time, be like, ‘I’m uncomfortable because I just got assaulted and there is no justice for me,’” O’Halloran said. “It’s a serious thing. Maybe we should be less concerned with our privacy and more about somebody getting justice.”</p>\n<p>Collegiate Senator for the College of Engineering Amir Khazaieli delivered a rebuttal to pro-surveillance advocates, as he cited numerous studies of other surveillance systems, highlighting a controversial one in England. According to Khazaieli, the system in England showed that there was “no evidence that mass surveillance had reduced overall crime rates” and there was also “evidence of clear abuse” from police units to target minorities.</p>\n<p>“This is considered mass surveillance,” Khazaieli said. “Some of the other places that have implemented stuff like this include the U.K., Iran, Russia, Vietnam, East Germany and Bahrain. … Places that have implemented video surveillance have shown and proven that it’s actually not effective.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieili also said he stresses the importance of protecting I.V. citizens’ constitutional rights on individual privacy.</p>\n<p>“I think there needs to be a lot of definite rules and regulations set forth with this so that it doesn’t conflict with anybody’s Fourth Amendment rights,” Khazaieli said. “I think we should definitely take action on this.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion surrounding police security measures, Senate moved onto other topics, which included the restructuring of A.S. The restructure plan has been in the works for several months and faced several revisions, culminating in its passing on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Nearly 20 bills connected to the restructure were passed, creating major changes in the way the executive office operates. Such changes include eliminating certain positions of the president’s staff, consolidating others and reforming legislative boards and commissions. One restructuring bill authored by A.S. President Jonathan Abboud removed the powers of the A.S. president to select the editorial staff of <i>The Bottom Line</i> (<i>TBL</i>) newspaper.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the changes to <i>The Bottom Line</i> would make the paper more autonomous.</p>\n<p>“<i>The Bottom Line</i> will be moved under the press council, like the [Daily] Nexus is,” Abboud said. “They’ll still be something that A.S. funds through a lock-in [fee], but it won’t be something [to which] I could say, ‘Well, I don’t want this editor to be the <i>TBL</i> editor’ and not appoint them. That takes away that power of the president to manage the press. That was important for me to take out.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, senators passed a resolution authored by Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras establishing a committee to reevaluate the Isla Vista Master Plan in an effort to increase community influence on new building developments.</p>\n<p>It was also announced that students could bring their artwork to the A.S. Pardall Center to have it displayed publicly for one month free of charge, after which it would be returned to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54596\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54596\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-04/associated-students-senate-discusses-deltopia-and-installation-of-security-cameras/","id":3024,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3023,3022,3021],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Arbor ‘Springs into A.S.’ This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students has launched a five day-long campaign this week called “Spring into A.S.,” with A.S. representatives stationed at the Arbor from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. all this week to encourage st...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students has launched a five day-long campaign this week called “Spring into A.S.,” with A.S. representatives stationed at the Arbor from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. all this week to encourage students to learn more ongoing A.S. projects and how to get involved with student government, in light of A.S. elections happening later this quarter.</p>\n<p>From topics of environmental sustainability and recruitment to budgeting finance and student health, “Spring into A.S.” will inform students about the organization’s role on campus, while simultaneously offering free food and variety of goodies. The week-long series of events are also tabled in collaboration with Committee on Committees and a variety of their other Boards, Committees and Commissions (BCCs).</p>\n<p>Today’s event, “A.S. Open House,” will take place at the A.S. Main Office in the Multicultural Center and will offer attendees time to network with A.S. officials. Tomorrow will feature two finance-related events called “Where’s My Money?” and “Teach the Budget.” Finally, Friday’s event, “Student Health Day,” will take place on the SRB Lawn to talk about mental, physical and sexual health.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Jonathan Abboud, the campaign was developed by the A.S. Office of the President. The week’s basic goal is to give students opportunities to learn about A.S. and decide whether it is a group they want to get involved in.</p>\n<p>“The project is to make visible all that Associated Students does and publicize Associated Students, get students more informed about where their money is going and what kind of activities we’re working on, especially before the election,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Monday’s event was “Sustainability Day,” which focused on the California drought as well as a number of other environmental issues in the county, especially regarding the coastline community of Santa Barbara. Members of the A.S. Office of the President, I.V. Tenants Union and Environmental Affairs Board also passed out reusable bags, pins supporting water conservation and free food from the I.V. Food Co-Op.</p>\n<p>Megan Roy, a fourth-year environmental studies major and Outreach and Education Coordinator of UCSB Coastal Fund, said the Coastal Fund is an A.S.-funded organization that provides grants for conservation projects for the local coast.</p>\n<p>“There are students who work in different labs, like bio labs … that directly relate to our mission statement of protecting, restoring and enhancing the coast,” Roy said. “It’s really cool to see a student come in and propose their project. We can fund their projects and make them happen.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s event was the “A.S. Recruitment Fair,” and at tomorrow’s event, “Where’s My Money?” A.S. will be distributing surveys to garner student input about how students think A.S. should allocate its $10.6 million budget.</p>\n<p>“Every year, we make a new budget, and that is a time we ask to students what they think is important to fund in the budget,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Also taking place tomorrow at the Student Resource Building (SRB) Multipurpose Room from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. will be “Teach the Budget,” a presentation on California’s budget and issues surrounding the financing of higher education.</p>\n<p>“Spring into A.S.” culminates on Friday at the SRB lawn with “Student Health Day.” A bounce house, free candy, condoms and lube will be provided at the event.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, Spring Quarter is when many opportunities open up in A.S. since all of the positions must be re-filled for the next school year. Some of these positions will be in the senate, executive office and BCCs.</p>\n<p>“All the positions in A.S. only last one year, so all 300-plus positions completely turn over every year,” Abboud said. “On top of that, they are employment positions. There’s probably close to 600 to 700 opportunities in A.S. total.”</p>\n<p>Aiden Brorsen, a second-year history of public policy major and Chair of the Committee on Committees, also said he believes now is an ideal time to start getting involved.</p>\n<p>“We are preparing students from spring to summer as opposed to just fall, so it’s kind of like a transitional event,” Brorsen said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54551\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54551\" data-attachment-id=\"54551\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/the-arbor-springs-into-a-s-this-week/springas_petervandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=3832%2C2833&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3832,2833\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1367591152\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"185\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=888%2C656&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-54551\" alt=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt-250x184.jpg?resize=250%2C184\" width=\"250\" height=\"184\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-54551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Spring into A.S.” holds a number of events this week to encourage student involvement in allocation of funds and office positions.
