T-Fresh as the winner of a spot on the main stage at Extravaganza 2014.</p>\n<p>After eight student DJs competed in Tuesday’s eight-bracket single-elimination round, local student DJs PsychoJohn, Dropwise, T-Fresh and Beta wave received the highest scores and were slated to move on to the final round. However, a last minute disqualification of DJ duo PsychoJohn bumped DJ Angarola up to last night’s final competition at the Hub.</p>\n<p>The first round of last night’s performances featured Angarola against Beta wave and T-Fresh against Dropwise. Judged based on mixing ability, song selection, originality and energy response, DJs Angarola and T-Fresh competed in the final head-to-head round with T-Fresh emerging victorious.</p>\n<p>According to Fish, last night’s victory fulfilled his longtime wish to play at an event featuring big-time headliner acts such as rappers Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar.</p>\n<p>“I’m speechless,” Fish said. “It’s been a dream since I was a freshman to be able to play an event like Extravaganza. Now with this coming true on my senior year, it’s just an incredible feeling.”</p>\n<p>Fish said last night’s Battle of the DJs served as a stepping stone allowing him to bring his talent from Isla Vista backyards to the big stage.</p>\n<p>“The set meant so much to me. I felt like it was the best set of my life,” Fish said. “There was so much energy and I was so into it because I wanted it so bad. Words can’t explain. I’m going to start my set now.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year biochemistry major Brian Kasimov, a.k.a. Dropwise, despite all the competing DJs’ differences in style, technique and personality, Battle of the DJs allowed peers with a “common goal” to come together and share their music with the student body.</p>\n<p>“It feels really good ‘cause all three other people who played tonight are my really good friends, so no matter what a great person is going win,” Kasimov said. “We’re all here to support each other … I like that it’s a healthy competitive spirit.”</p>\n<p>Third-year microbiology major and event-attendee Brett Russell criticized the judge’s choices, claiming Angarola generally had a greater “variety of beat,” even as he played a “solid six minutes of straight Disclosure with pop songs mixed on top.”</p>\n<p>“Angarola made me gig in ways I haven’t experimented with before, and with T-fresh, I really felt the need to sarcastically dance by simply standing in place and pumping my arms up and down,” Russell said. “Although T-fresh’s Space Jam mix was by far the best song I heard of the whole night … in general, during his set, I felt like I was in 2010.”</p>\n<p>However, according to A.S. Program Board publicity coordinator and third-year communication and film &amp; media studies major Karen Masumoto, T-Fresh rightfully won first place by bringing “great energy” to the event, showcasing his widely-liked, well-versed talent. Masumoto said the event went swimmingly and has prompted Program Board to continue doing an annual Battle of the DJs from now on.</p>\n<p>“T-Fresh was awesome! He really got the crowd going,” Masumoto said. “It’s cool to see everyone in the music scene come together to support each other.”</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-54120-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-3rd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1491%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54121\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (3rd) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-4th-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1504%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54122\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (4th) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-1st-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54123\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (1st) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-2nd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54124\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (2nd) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p>Photos by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), the event will simultaneously educate students about local affairs while providing them with the opportunity to build relationships with elected officials. Students will not only learn about current issues in Santa Barbara but can also pose questions to local government leaders concerning matters particularly relevant to UCSB students, such as infrastructure in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>UCSB Associated Students EVPLA Alex Moore said the event gives students an important opportunity to voice their concerns about local issues, as students represent a large portion of the population in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“We contribute a lot as UCSB students, and it’s important for county leaders to hear what students have to say about local issues and the community here,” Moore said. “Things that happen on local levels can really affect the lives of the students. County leadership is the main government body that affects Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Moore said the event will hopefully demonstrate to students the impact of local affairs work and subsequently encourage students to become more involved with the affairs of the community.</p>\n<p>“More engaged students and more engaged civic members is a better community,” Moore said. “It gives students the tools to give their stance, come up with ideas and be able to represent themselves.”</p>\n<p>According to the EVPLA office County Liaison Maile Hartsook, the planning process for this event goes back to October, when she and Moore began organizing for it.</p>\n<p>The organizers completed a campus-wide call for applications and Hartsook said attendees, who were chosen through the application process, make up a diverse group of individuals such as transfer students, minority students and members of the Greek system.</p>\n<p>In addition, all of the students will have attended trainings in preparation for the event. The preparatory training, Hartsook said, will hopefully enable students and county leaders to recognize and become aware of each other’s needs.</p>\n<p>“I am very excited for ‘Day at the County,’ especially because it is the first of its kind,” Hartsook said. “It is meant to be a learning opportunity for both … The officials will learn what local issues are important to the UCSB community, and students will gain an insight into local politics.”</p>\n<p>First District Supervisor and UCSB alumnus Salud Carbajal said he is looking forward to communicating with students and viewing issues from their respective perspectives, so he can potentially foster longer-lasting relationships with the student body.</p>\n<p>“I hope the students will get an opportunity to communicate with the county government the most important issues at the campus,” Carbajal said. “We are county decision makers so we want to best form a partnership.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal also said he encourages students to openly voice their opinions, saying he hopes they will introduce ideas and points of discussion that will potentially improve “the quality of life in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>“You can never go wrong with working on a relationship and having good communication between local government issues and students who are responsible for shaping the campus policies,” Carbajal said. “I’m really looking forward to the exchange. I was a UCSB student once upon a time, so I understand the campus life.”</p>\n<p>Fourth District Supervisor Peter Adam said he will be answering student questions regarding finances and added that he looks forward to the exchange and the ideas that will come from it.</p>\n<p>“I want to fill in some gaps from [the students], especially if we can have a good discussion on economics, government spending and maintenance priorities,” Adam said. “Hopefully, students will understand that they should expect a lot from their politicians.”<br>\nA version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/county-officials-to-meet-students-at-selective-event/","id":3048,"author":{"id":162,"name":"Kelly Lin"},"related":[3047,3046,3045],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Curiouser and Curiouser: Last Lecturer Shares His Story","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last night, linguistics professor Robert Kennedy lectured as if it were his last chance to do so, speaking on linguistics and his own personal experiences in the field, as part of the UCSB “Last Lec...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Prof. Robert Kennedy Gives UCSB’s Third ‘Last Lecture,’ Imparts Wisdom on Life, Love and Finding a Career</h3>\n<p>Last night, linguistics professor Robert Kennedy lectured as if it were his last chance to do so, speaking on linguistics and his own personal experiences in the field, as part of the UCSB “Last Lecture” series.</p>\n<p>As the third installment of the UCSB “Last Lecture” series — which is sponsored by Associated Students and the Academic Affairs Board — Kennedy’s lecture gave insight into everything from his boyhood love of scrutinizing maps to his high school fascination with Latin. His talk drew focus to the idea of curiosity and how his own love of facts and trivia led him to where he is today. The event is part of the “Last Lecture” series, which is inspired by the lecture Carnegie Mellon computer science professor Randy Pausch gave in 2007 before passing away from pancreatic cancer. Kennedy, like all other UCSB last lecturers, was nominated and chosen to speak by UCSB’s undergraduate population, and he was required to present a lecture as if it is the last one in his lifetime.</p>\n<p>According to Kennedy, his curiosity has made him happy and now he seeks to share that curiosity with the students he engages. In discussing his love of linguistics, Kennedy said he chose it as a major, instead of Latin, because he felt there was more to learn and explore. By talking about his own personal and professional endeavors, Kennedy said he is hoping to inspire students to fulfill their own passion and goals as well as possibly take another look into the field of linguistics.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping to … encourage the audience to be okay immersing themselves in the details of what they love to learn about, to be open to a different perspective on language usage,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>To do so, Kennedy delved into a number of personal anecdotes, including the story of his time on the popular television trivia game show, “Jeopardy!” Getting on the show was a struggle enough, Kennedy said, requiring three auditions and a skipped visit to his in-laws before he was finally selected to be one of the contestants. However, once on “Jeopardy!” Kennedy won two shows in a row and, at one point mid-competition, made a notable comeback by rising from $600 to $4,400 in one go.</p>\n<p>Edrick Sarkissian, a UCSB alum who graduated last year with a degree in linguistics, said he previously took a few of Kennedy’s classes and thought of the professor as skilled in delivering relatable and engaging lectures. In this light, Sarkissian said the last lecture was a special treat, as he got to know more about the professor’s experiences through his own words.</p>\n<p>“It was neat because he’s someone I’ve always looked up to as a professor, and it was cool to get this insider view of his life,” Sarkissian said. “I know he talked a lot about ‘Jeopardy!’ but that is something that comes up in class a lot, so it was really neat to actually get the whole ‘Jeopardy!’ story first-hand from Kennedy, rather than from teaching assistants.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Kennedy took a few moments to teach the audience a bit about linguistics, diving into what he called the “fake rules” of grammar, such as not ending a sentence with a preposition and referring to one person as “they” or using “literally” to mean “figuratively.” Kennedy also brought up how certain people have a tendency to make judgments about those who make the aforementioned grammatical errors.</p>\n<p>As for other topics discussed within the lecture, Kennedy talked about how language can sometimes be used to justify injustice, how misogyny is often masked as linguistic critique of women’s high pitch and why there is a tendency for people to say the filler word “like” so often. He also touched on the negative stereotypes mapped onto people who speak “African American English” and differences between English and languages rarely spoken today, such as Chumash — which uses a base-four counting system —and Guugu Yimithirr, which incorporates cardinal directions into everyday speech.</p>\n<p>Sarah Luchetta, a first-year English and linguistics double major who took Linguistics 20 with Kennedy last quarter, said she thinks Kennedy is “a really cool dude” who sent a “really good message” about following one’s dreams, especially in light of the current job market for college graduates.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a lot of people are so worried they have to be a part of a STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] major or econ, or something they will for sure get a job in,” Luchetta said. “Your chances are a lot better off if you’re doing something that you really care about, because then you’ll work that much harder to get a job in that field.”</p>\n<p>Olivia Nemec, a first-year undeclared major, said the lecture felt very relevant to her as a student who has yet to pick out a focused field of study.</p>\n<p>“It was really funny; it was really engaging,” Nemec said. “I really think it was inspiring because it was for people who don’t know what they want to do, kind of like me … it felt really motivational.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54246\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54246\" data-attachment-id=\"54246\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/curiouser-and-curiouser-last-lecturer-shares-his-story/mylastlecture_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?fit=1498%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1498,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Peter Vandenbelt VBDphotos.com\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1393445111\",\"copyright\":\"Peter R.

Yang made a surprise appearance.</p>\n<p>“A Resolution to Mandate Warnings for Triggering Content in Academic Settings,” urges university officials to require professors who present content that may trigger the onset of symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to warn the students ahead of time and refrain from docking points from those who opt out of attending class that day. The resolution also directs A.S. executives to bring the proposal to the attention of the UC Student Association board and the Academic Senate and asks that the office of the Student Advocate General appoint a staff member to devise a list of trigger warnings. Also at the meeting, Chancellor Yang appeared to deliver letters to each of the senators, in which he declared his determination to take action as a result of the sexual assaults that occurred over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Among other promises, Yang stated there will be increased lighting around the UCSB lagoon and more Foot Patrol and Community Service Officers in Isla Vista, in addition to increased staff in the counseling and advocacy services.</p>\n<p>Bailey Loverin, chief of staff for the Student Advocate General and student sponsor of the resolution, cited her personal experience sitting through triggering content as her reason for writing the resolution.</p>\n<p>“Tonight I am coming to you…first as a student, second as a woman and third, as a survivor of sexual abuse,” Loverin said. “Two weeks ago, I sat in class watching a film screening and felt forced to watch two scenes in which the instance of sexual assault was insinuated and one in which an instance of rape was graphically depicted … there was no warning before this film screening … and it was incredibly difficult to sit through.”</p>\n<p>Loverin said although she did not want to sit through the film, it was more difficult to walk out during the movie and draw attention to herself. She said the resolution was intended to aid students who had experienced trauma and retained symptoms of PTSD.</p>\n<p>“[The resolution] recognizes that trigger warnings are symptoms of PTSD and UCSB Disabled Students Program recognizes PTSD as a disability,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>However, Loverin also said that the resolution is not asking for the removal or censorship of any triggering content, but rather better consideration of victims of sexual assault and PTSD.</p>\n<p>“This is not meant to censor … but it really just asks that professors and other people on campus acknowledge the effects of triggering content on students with PTSD,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>Before the Senate eventually passed the resolution, On-Campus Senator Nikki Calderon said all of the senators should do everything in their power to ensure university officials are aware of the request and Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras added another note of support.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in this kind of situation before — it sucks; we should pass it,” Contreras said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, A.S. President Jonathan Abboud reported he will be meeting with California Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and California State Assemblyman Das Williams, along with the co-chairs of UCSB Take Back the Night, to discuss introducing state legislation around sexual assault policy and prevention.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54277\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/a-s-senate-passes-proposal-to-label-trauma-provoking-academic-content/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54277\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/a-s-senate-passes-proposal-to-label-trauma-provoking-academic-content/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/a-s-senate-passes-proposal-to-label-trauma-provoking-academic-content/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/a-s-senate-passes-proposal-to-label-trauma-provoking-academic-content/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/a-s-senate-passes-proposal-to-label-trauma-provoking-academic-content/","id":3050,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3049,3048,3047],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
