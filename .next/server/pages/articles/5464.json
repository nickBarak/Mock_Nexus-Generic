The next day, despite a fourth set rally, the Gauchos (8-6 overall, 1-1 Big West) were unable to come away with the victory as they lost another tough match in five sets. The loss was only their second in the last nine matches.</p>\n<p>“It was very important [to win at least one game],” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “We’re a little disappointed about Fullerton. It doesn’t matter what the rankings are.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara opened Saturday’s match by winning the first set 25-15, but dropped the next two 25-12 and 25-13.</p>\n<p>“We basically defeated ourselves by making errors, and they started making fewer errors,” senior libero Chelsey Lowe said.</p>\n<p>In the fourth set, UCSB battled back and eked out a 26-24 win, but it would not be enough. The Gauchos opened the fifth set by taking a 6-3 lead but, after a timeout, Fullerton went on a 4-0 run to jump ahead. A few points later the Gauchos tied the set at nine apiece, but a hitting error from senior right side Stacey Schmidt gave Fullerton the lead. The Titans commanded the rest of the match, going on to win the set 15-10 and hand the Gauchos the loss.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t feel like we played badly, they just played better,” Lowe said. “It felt like we couldn’t get going. They had a really good home crowd and that got to us. It’s hard to play away.”</p>\n<p>The stat sheet of the match tells a different story than the final result. UCSB recorded a season-high 94 digs and Lowe and sophomore Leah Sully each put up career highs in that category, with 33 and 23 respectively. Lowe now has 1030 career digs. The defense also held Fullerton to just a .139 hitting percentage, but UCSB hit only .070 and committed 30 hitting errors.</p>\n<p>“The night before we had one of our best passing games,” Gregory said. “In this game our passing went down. We just continually went outside too much.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s match was not any easier, though the result for the Gauchos was more favorable. Long Beach took the first set 25-19 on a hitting error by UCSB, but Santa Barbara came right back in the second set, never trailing on their way to a 25-18 win. Sully led the squad in that set, collecting four kills, including three in a row, to give the Gauchos a 12-6 lead.</p>\n<p>The third set was fought down to the final point. After battling back to get within one point at 24-23, the Gauchos lost the set 25-23 on a Long Beach kill. The fourth set saw UCSB trail until a hitting error gave the Gauchos a 21-20 lead. The team then went on to win the set 25-23 and force a fifth set after taking three of the final four points on kills from Schmidt, senior Kara Sherrard and sophomore Katey Thompson, who had a career-high 13 kills on the day, to go along with a career-high 17 digs.</p>\n<p>“We were very fortunate [to win that fourth game],” Gregory said. “Once you get down two games to one, you’re just thinking about surviving.”</p>\n<p>Early in the fifth set the Gauchos trailed 5-2 but after Gregory called a timeout, UCSB went on a 7-2 run during which five Gauchos recorded kills. After battling to get ahead 13-11 in their favor, the Gauchos finished the set — and match — 15-11 behind consecutive kills from Thompson and Sherrard.</p>\n<p>“We adjusted our passing rotation,” Gregory said. “The outside hitters turned it on and we defended a little bit better. In a game like that you have to find a way to win, and we did.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will next take the court to face Pacific at home on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41256\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41256\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/","id":5464,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5463,5462,5461],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg","biography":"Not available","articles":[286,294,298,299,410,422,425,430,1687,2124,2127,2130,2137,2139,2287,2304,2786,2808,2865,2871,2894,2897,3055,3145,3500,3501,4518,4529,5174,5175,5176,5177,5178,5180,5181,5182,5184,5188,5212,5216,5221,5222,5223,5224,5225,5226,5227,5228,5229,5235,5255,5256,5257,5463,5464,5466,5552],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Volleyball Loses in NCAA Championship to Ohio State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos gave everything they had left in the tank, but ultimately it was not enough as the team fell to No. 8 Ohio State in a dramatic five-set NCAA Championship match on Saturday by a score of 3-...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Gauchos gave everything they had left in the tank, but ultimately it was not enough as the team fell to No. 8 Ohio State in a dramatic five-set NCAA Championship match on Saturday by a score of 3-2 (20-25, 25-20, 25-19, 22-25, 15-9) at Penn State University.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of my team, especially all the seniors for having a great year,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “It started three years ago, and they gave everything they had.

Targeted by the Ohio State defense, senior outside hitter Jeff Menzel was significantly limited by the Buckeyes, posting 13 kills and a hitting percentage of .025, his lowest of the year. Senior middle blocker Scott Slaughter stepped up for the Gauchos, recording eight kills to go along with a team-high hitting percentage of .583, but Ohio State went on a 5-0 run to close the fifth set and win the crown.</p>\n<p>“They got more stops then we did,” Slaughter said. “We did something that no one thought we could: We made one of the biggest runs in college volleyball history. You can hang your head for losing the final, but as long as you left it all out on the court there’s no reason to.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were unable to come up with an answer for Ohio State’s junior outside hitter Shawn Sangrey, who recorded a season-high 30 kills for the Buckeyes. Sophomore Grayson Overman had 12 kills and a match-high hitting percentage of .800. With 65 assists on the night, senior setter Steven Kehoe was named Tournament MVP.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t make the stops when we needed them,” Irons said. “We played a good match, but unfortunately we came up a little short. They did everything well and got a lot of blocks.”</p>\n<p>The Buckeyes’ 26 service errors gave UCSB a chance to keep the match close throughout, but Ohio State never allowed the Gauchos to maintain their momentum. The decisive fifth set was full of tension, each team trading points back and forth. But the Buckeyes pulled away and secured the victory with a team block on Menzel.</p>\n<p>The loss ended the squad’s improbable postseason run and the team’s four-game win streak, the longest of the season. UCSB now stands at 0-5 in NCAA title matches in school history. The last time the team was in the finals in 1988, the squad fell to USC. The Gauchos finish the 2011 season with an overall record of 18-15 to go along with an 11-11 conference mark.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/volleyball-loses-ncaa-championship-ohio-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/volleyball-loses-ncaa-championship-ohio-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/volleyball-loses-ncaa-championship-ohio-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/volleyball-loses-ncaa-championship-ohio-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/volleyball-loses-ncaa-championship-ohio-state/","id":5461,"author":{"id":296,"name":"Kirk Reed"},"related":[5460,5459,5458],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finally, a Homecoming for the Gauchos","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After 16 games on the road, the UCSB women’s volleyball team will finally get its first chance to play in the Thunderdome this season.

UCSB defeated Long Beach State 3-2 but then lost to Cal State Fullerton 3-2.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton and Long Beach showed a few of our weaknesses,” Gregory said. “We need better offensive production, as proved by Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>The team is also going up against a former Gaucho when it faces the Tigers.</p>\n<p>“Pacific’s coach [Greg Gibbons] is our old assistant coach, so it would be nice to beat him,” Lowe said. “We just have to be consistent and not give up runs.”</p>\n<p>Preventing long runs is one way the Gauchos are hoping to slow down Pacific’s potent offense.</p>\n<p>“We pride ourselves on our defense,” Lowe said. “They’re a really good offensive team but hopefully we get them frustrated … it’ll be a battle but I know we can win.”</p>\n<p>UC Davis (16-1, 2-0) presents another challenge, as they have won 11 straight matches heading into this weekend.</p>\n<p>“Davis is for real,” Gregory said. “They’re the number one offensive team in the league. They have the best setter in the league, [Jenny Woolway]. She’s just a sophomore but she’s the most athletic. They also don’t have a freshman starter so they’re the most experienced [in the Big West].”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos know that improving to 3-1 in conference play is necessary to move to the top of the standings. A solid record and experience on the road are a prime combination toward the ultimate goal of a playoff  berth.</p>\n<p>“We have really high expectations,” Lowe said. “We have to win both of these matches to have chance of being first in league. We just have to focus on our side of the net … I know if we play our game we can definitely beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to get offensive production from several players to counter Davis’ high-powered attack.</p>\n<p>“We will have to show we can spread the offense,” senior right side Stacey Schmidt said. “Against Long Beach, we had five players in double digit kills and that is a big part of why we won that match. We will also have to play consistent throughout the entire match and keep their point runs to a minimum. Davis is a great team but I think our tough preseason prepared us for these conference match ups.”</p>\n<p>Match time is set for 7:30 p.m. on Friday against Pacific and 7:30 p.m. on Saturday against UC Davis in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41429\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/finally-homecoming-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41429\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/finally-homecoming-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/finally-homecoming-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/finally-homecoming-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/finally-homecoming-gauchos/","id":5462,"author":{"id":192,"name":"David Russo"},"related":[5461,5460,5459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Pair of Big West Openers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team split its opening games of conference play on the road last weekend, beating No. 21 Long Beach State on Friday before falling to Cal State Fullerton on Saturday.

The Gauchos opened the fifth set by taking a 6-3 lead, but, after a timeout, Fullerton went on a 4-0 run to jump ahead. A few points later the Gauchos tied the set at nine apiece, but a hitting error from senior right side Stacey Schmidt gave Fullerton the lead. The Titans commanded the rest of the match, going on to win the set 15-10 and hand the Gauchos the loss.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t feel like we played badly, they just played better,” Lowe said. “It felt like we couldn’t get going. They had a really good home crowd and that got to us. It’s hard to play away.”</p>\n<p>The stat sheet of the match tells a different story than the final result. They recorded a season-high 94 digs and Lowe and sophomore Leah Sully each put up career highs in that category, with 33 and 23, respectively. Lowe now has 1030 career digs. The defense also held Fullerton to just a .139 hitting percentage, but UCSB hit only .070 and committed 30 hitting errors.</p>\n<p>“The night before we had one of our best passing games,” Gregory said. “In this game our passing went down. We just continually went outside too much.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s match was not any easier, though the result for the Gauchos was more favorable. Long Beach took the first set 25-19 on a hitting error by UCSB, but Santa Barbara came right back in the second set, never trailing on their way to a 25-18 win. Sully led the squad in that set, collecting four kills, including three in a row, to give the Gauchos a 12-6 lead.</p>\n<p>The third set was fought down to the final point. After battling back to get within one point at 24-23, the Gauchos lost the set 25-23 on a Long Beach kill. The fourth set saw UCSB trail until a hitting error gave the Gauchos a 21-20 lead. The team then went on to win the set 25-23 and force a fifth set after taking three of the final four points on kills from Schmidt, senior Kara Sherrard and sophomore Katey Thompson, who had a career-high 13 kills on the day, to go along with a career-high 17 digs.</p>\n<p>“We were very fortunate [to win that fourth game],” Gregory said. “Once you get down two games to one, you’re just thinking about surviving.”</p>\n<p>Early in the fifth set the Gauchos trailed 5-2 , but, after Gregory called a timeout, UCSB went on a 7-2 run during which five Gauchos recorded kills. After battling to get ahead 13-11 in their favor, the Gauchos finished the set – and match – 15-11 behind consecutive kills from Thompson and Sherrard.</p>\n<p>“We adjusted our passing rotation,” Gregory said. “The outside hitters turned it on and we defended a little bit better. In a game like that you have to find a way to win, and we did.”<br>\nUCSB will next take the court to face Pacific at home on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41192\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-25/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-openers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41192\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-25/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-openers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-25/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-openers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-25/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-openers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-25/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-openers/","id":5463,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5462,5461,5460],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
