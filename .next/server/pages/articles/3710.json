Tragedy) was chosen for the director role because of her history of activism. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years ago, Collins Puente joined this seaside community as UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) community advisor. She was recruited for the position following the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/five-years-later-i-v-honors-victims-of-2014-shooting-with-recreation-of-original-vigil/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2014 Isla Vista tragedy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because, as she put it, the community wanted to see tangible changes in the culture, social services and space in I.V.: “There was a strong need for healing from the tragedy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente credited her time at A.S. for preparing her for the role of the I.V. Community Center (IVCC) director. While working for A.S., she focused on community-based initiatives, tackling several projects and focusing on “solving everyday problems that the residents of Isla Vista faced, like tenant issues, eviction, mental health, alcohol and drugs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente, who was exposed to activism growing up as a child in Guatemala during its Civil War, was selected for her role based on her history as an activist, she said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the path toward creating the center, let alone hiring a director, was not linear; the building housing the first community center in I.V. was sold in the 1970s, and financial setbacks prevented the community from building another. It wasn’t until 2012, after the county </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?fbclid=IwAR3QaUeBMMhQK_y2x2568or0Cmjdyrxma-7hGTLh3PsmHbDRalDbqA86r1E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purchased the center’s current location</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 976 Embarcadero del Mar, that steps towards actively creating a new center began.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center will have a soft opening in October with a grand opening in either January or February 2020, according to an update posted to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Facebook page. Collins Puente officially began her position on Aug. 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Collins Puente, the IVCC will act as a hub for I.V. residents, addressing the various needs of the community. Puente will work with the IVCC Advisory Board, which is currently being filled, to “ensure that the values and priorities of community members are thoughtfully taken into account in order to inform the strategic direction, vision, and programming of the new Community Center,” according to a press release sent out by the I.V. CSD board of directors in mid-July.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advisory board will be composed of several members of the community, some of whom have already been elected by the I.V. CSD. At the Aug. 13 I.V. CSD meeting, the board voted to postpone its vote on the final non-profit seat on the board until its Aug. 27 meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new IVCC director position is funded by a $177,000 one-year grant from the I.V. CSD to Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) in order to manage the development, fundraising, programming and strategic future of the center, the press release said. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said that Collin Puente’s experience with social justice through nonprofit work will help create a “collective vision” for the center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been lucky to know and work with people in Isla Vista who are incredibly dedicated to building community – none more so than Diana Collins-Puente. As the Director of Community Affairs in Associated Students, she advised me and countless other students who sought to make a difference,” Brandt said in an email statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vistans have been fighting for a community center for over three decades, and I can’t think of a better person to implement our collective vision than Diana.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente has big plans for the future of the community center, hoping to balance the needs of the UCSB student population living in I.V. with the rest of the community. She hopes to craft the IVCC into a multi-use space, which would include hosting exercise and nutrition classes as well as a wide range of recreational and self-help activities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has a need for classrooms, so the space could potentially be used for that, while also providing a practical space for the rest of the community. Classes would be offered to them as well, ranging from legal classes to self-help classes, and we plan to include a demonstration kitchen,” Collins Puente said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente noted that plans for the IVCC are rooted in her involvement with the Pardall Center – a UCSB-operated collaborative space located in I.V. – for the last five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want the IVCC to do what the Pardall Center couldn’t,” Collins Puente said. “The needs of the community have simply been too large for the Pardall Center, so the IVCC will address the larger projects that can’t be sustained at the Pardall Center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente also plans to work with the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District, which will manage the recreational activities and play a role in the development of the space, alongside the IVYP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration,” Collins Puente said. “The center really speaks to the very unique nature of how I.V. has been able to support the building of institutions like the IVYP, the IVCC, and the I.V. CSD… It is a hub that brings together diverse members of the community that allows for us to engage with each other.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a pride in it being a community effort.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/","id":3710,"author":{"id":44,"name":"Christina Muoio"},"related":[3709,3708,3707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":44,"name":"Christina Muoio","biography":"Not available","articles":[1986,3333,3346,3710,4063,4289,7118,7151,7188,7196,7199,7256,7267,7276,7277,7285,7372,7525,7559,7581,7609],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A Look Inside the History of “The Most Unique Local Government in California”","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2019-08-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As it approaches nearly three years since that November election, the district has begun to land on its feet following a rocky first few years. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista – a square mile of land dually known for its activism and its daygers, a community neither Goleta or Santa Barbara will claim as its own – has been fighting for a form of self-governance for decades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it wasn’t until Election Day 2016 that those efforts came to fruition, when Isla Vistans voted into existence the Isla Vista Community Service District (I.V.

The position of interim general manager was created to account for the district’s unexpectedly small budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-13/i-v-csd-shakes-up-board-leadership/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succeeded Bertrand as president in December</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; Jordan </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/term-in-review-i-v-csd-vice-president-natalie-jordan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has since left</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was replaced by new director Kristie Nguyen; Geis is now vice president, and the secretary position was eliminated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FUNDING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district faced several crippling impediments at its formation, but none more so than one that loomed for nearly two years after its creation: a lack of funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board theoretically had the power to implement programs and make changes around I.V., it didn’t have the funding to do so. An eight percent utility tax on I.V. residents </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed in the 2016 election, with only 62% of residents voting yes.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It needed 66.66% of the vote to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Darcél Elliott had managed the campaigns for both the district and its accompanying tax. When the district passed but the funding failed, Elliott pointed to campaigns by I.V. property owners who had vocally opposed the tax.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this election, fear won over hope,” Elliott said on election night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district’s funds would come from a yearly $200,000 grant from UCSB, but the money could only be spent on services the university agreed were useful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if the district failed to secure a tax by 2023, it would cease to exist, a deadline that haunted the newly formed district. So when the board placed a new tax on the June 2018 ballot, local campaigners ramped up their efforts to win voter approval. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-83520\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of the “Vote Yes on Measure R” campaign celebrate after learning of the passing of the tax. (Pictured left to right: Ethan Bertrand, Emily Murray, Spencer Brandt and Jonathan Abboud.) <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 80% of Isla Vistans would vote to provide the district funding through </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a measure that was nearly identical to its failed predecessor, Measure F. Measure R promised improvements to parking, public safety, lighting and sidewalks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75% vs. 17.25%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eight percent tax has brought an influx of cash into the district. The district ended its 2018-2019 fiscal year with nearly half a million in spending compared to over $800,000 in income – a far cry from what it started out with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the next fiscal year, the district </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-19/i-v-csd-budget-sees-about-200000-increase-in-funding-for-next-fiscal-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expects a $200,000 increase in funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rounding up to more than $1 million, according to numbers released by the district in May. </span></p>\n<p><b>THE CSD’S FIRST SERVICES: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without consistent revenue, the district spent its first year setting up as many services as possible with its limited resources, which involved “lots of strong partnerships with other government agencies and non-profit service providers,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board’s first project was expanding community policing efforts. Community Service Organization (CSO) safety officers have always escorted students home on weekend nights, but the district worked with UCSB to set up in-person stations at streetside locations for students to seek help.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSOs — who almost always are UCSB students themselves — worked over 3,000 hours and provided over 300 escorts during the last academic year, according to numbers released in July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re there not to enforce, but to help people, to give out water, to help people charge their phones, to give people an escort home and when there is a safety concern, they’re there to call it into the police,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD has also focused on sexual violence-related issues, hiring the first </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to work within the UCPD and partnering with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) to set up a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the district’s most recent initiatives is a community-led beautification program, where I.V. residents can report graffiti, trash, vandalism or lighting issues to the district. The district will then either send out workers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">houseless community members they hired to tackle these issues </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or forward the requests to the county if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community,” Brandt said at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">program’s launch</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHERE THE CSD HAS STRUGGLED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The directors have acknowledged that the board, in its first iteration, struggled to reflect the demographics of I.V.’s population – six of the seven board members are male, and Bertrand was the only person of color on the board until Nguyen replaced Jordan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen is still the only woman on the board, and Bertrand is the only member that identifies as LGBTQ+. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I say this as a straight white guy – it’s a huge problem that it’s only people who look like me who feel most empowered to get involved in local government,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We benefit so much from the perspective and the leadership of women and people of color, and it is really something that we, speaking for myself and for all of us, really try to encourage the next generation of leaders to reflect that and would like to see a more diverse board in the future.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand emphasized that the board did vote a “gay man of color” as its first president and a woman as its vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district has also stalled on its promise of a low-income exception to the tax, which it campaigned on ahead of the June 2018 election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last fall, more than four months after the tax had passed, the directors were still split on whether or not to implement the exemption, with some directors arguing that residents could expose loopholes to avoid the tax. The board has still not addressed implementing the promised exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9, 2018 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, the district has also failed to substantively address the issue of parking in I.V. — an issue it was formed to tackle. Parking in I.V. remains one of the biggest downsides to living in the tightly-packed neighborhood, with limited parking attached to houses and even fewer open spots available on the street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street parking in I.V. can also be dangerous; numerous students have posted on social media about windows being smashed and mirrors removed by drunk cyclists or a baseball bat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During larger events like Deltopia or Halloween, the university actively encourages students to purchase parking passes to move their cars out of I.V. and remove valuables from their cars. </span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the broader parking issue, I think that’s been one of those issues where everyone has made it very clear to us that it’s a difficult problem to solve, and that if we’re gonna do anything on it, we need to have the internal staff capacity to be able to put something together that actually works,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the future, we really need to have a professional come in and assess the situation and make some strong recommendations.” </span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT COMES NEXT?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is tackling what is probably its biggest project yet – the revival of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a center that many I.V. residents thought would never exist. The center is set to have a soft opening in October and a grand opening in January or February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand noted that even before the I.V. CSD was created, he and Brandt attended meetings for the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to express the need for I.V.’s own community center. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89599\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/iv-community-building_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89599\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89599\" data-attachment-id=\"89599\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/iv-community-building_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1315&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1315\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Community Building_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C584&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89599\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=888%2C584\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"584\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C505&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C673&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IV-Community-Building_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89599\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The community center is set to have a soft opening in October. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At their board retreat a few weeks ago, the directors talked about their goals, both short-term and long-term, for the district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether it’s cityhood or not, all of us want there to be the strongest local government for Isla Vista,” Bertrand said. “I think our overarching goal was for I.V. to be a community where people can live comfortably, where someone can come to college here but doesn’t have to leave when they graduate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, this is a place where people come for a few years for school and there’s some people who’ve made their lives here.

I.V. composes nearly a third of the population within the 3rd District. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3rd District supervisor is typically a tie-breaking position on the board, with two left-leaning zones to the south and two conservative ones to the north. Hartmann is running as a nonpartisan candidate; Jones is running as a Republican. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race’s third candidate, Bruce Porter, who also ran against Hartmann in 2016, did not attend the town hall. His campaign released a statement Tuesday afternoon requesting the town hall be rescheduled due to a “lack of communication among the organizers,” which includes Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs (A.S. EVPLA), Movement for Intersectional Collective Action (MICA), the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Center, Gauchos Vote and the Beloved Community Isla Vista</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA, and Diana Garcia, an organizer with MICA, responded to Porter through a statement sent out later that afternoon, saying that while they would not be rescheduling the event, they were “very open to hosting another town hall event” that includes Porter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter also later said in a press release that he plans on hosting a separate town hall in I.V. next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Porter was not present at Tuesday’s town hall, his absence loomed over the event, as both Hartmann and Jones commented on his lack of presence.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Tonight, Bruce Porter was going to tell you that he cares about you,” Hartmann told the crowd at the end of her opening statement. “But he didn’t show up.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He bragged to his supporters about the 1,400 fewer students registered in I.V. [in 2016]. He only got 20% of the vote in I.V.; I got 80%,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hartmann and Jones disagreed across the board on a variety of topics, at the heart of their differences are their career paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the incumbent, Hartmann emphasized her ongoing political experience with the Board of Supervisors and the projects she has spearheaded over the past four years since her election in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones, on the other hand, positioned herself as a political outsider, emphasizing the deregulation of private businesses as one of her main platform points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan and I have very different approaches to things, and the people who trust me are my friends and neighbors,” Jones said, repeatedly bringing up her working-class experience and lack of a college education throughout the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan has spent a lifetime working in government and she’s met some really educated, neat people like herself, but they really are not the experts on innovation or the private sector.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed issues relating to climate change and renewable energy;  Hartmann extensively spoke about her pro-environmental record and her goal to transition Santa Barbara to clean, renewable energy sources.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sustainable, renewable, predictably priced energy will be very important [for the economy],” she said, adding that clean energy would work as an appeal to bring larger companies to the northern county, both creating additional jobs and helping the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann also discussed current composting groups and efforts to ban single-use plastics on campus and in I.V. as an initiative the county could also adopt to become environmentally friendly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones did not shy away from her pro-fossil fuel stance and her own family’s connection to the oil industry in the northern county, which she views as a job creator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Hartmann] talks about S.T.E.M. jobs, this is it. I mean fossil fuel production, those involve S.T.E.M. jobs, that’s not just a bunch of meatheads doing that. These are very sophisticated jobs,” Jones said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fossil fuels are solar energy; that is stored solar energy, folks. That is through photosynthesis. The breakdown of plants become oil and we harvest it now for energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the issue of affordable housing, both candidates agreed there is a need for additional workforce housing, particularly in I.V., but differed on what the solution would look like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones proposed cutting down taxes and reducing government regulations to make room for smaller developers to build more housing in the county. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t always keep fitting more rats in the aquarium,” Jones said, referring to the spike in UCSB’s student population over the years without a comparable increase in housing options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones suggested that prospective university students should consider initially forgoing higher education in order to decrease local housing prices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann noted that the price of rent in Santa Barbara has increased three times faster than the cost of living and said she was “working hard to force the university to follow through on their required mandate” from the state to build more housing for faculty and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of-living</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adjustment (COLA) movements by graduate students at UCSB and in the larger UC system, which Hartmann said she supports. Jones said that she hopes the graduate students can work out a deal with the university but added that she dislikes using union tactics to do so. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two candidates also provided drastically different opinions on the topic of equity and diversity in I.V. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also believe that our institutions must do everything they can to promote diversity and inclusion,” Hartmann said. “When I was a graduate student, I was the only woman in my class and there were no women professors at my graduate school.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones responded, saying, “I don’t see color, I don’t see sexual orientation, I don’t even see sex,” and believes that no group should gain “special” rights. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she is “the only local person that is native-born, married to a guy who was born in the 3rd District.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another topic affecting both I.V. and the county as a whole is the legalization and regulation of recreational cannabis. Hartmann said she has worked to change county-wide legislation from a lottery to merit-based system when issuing cannabis dispensary licenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People [have] said to me, ‘Hell no, we don’t want [a lottery system]. You go back and change the county’s mind because we want a merit-based system.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann said that she’ll be back in I.V. in the spring to hold a community meeting for residents to discuss what they want in an ideal cannabis dispensary applicant, and from there, will use that input to assess which applicant will fit the goals and needs of I.V. residents, a process that will “differ by community” across the county.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said she favors private businesses and deregulation in the cannabis industry and said she believes regulations get in the way of small businesses, like cannabis dispensaries, from operating. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann argued that county regulation of the cannabis industry was necessary, saying that without regulation, cannabis “can be quite contaminated and create a lot of problems for people in our county.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones acknowledged in her closing statement that, as a Republican, she is unlikely to win many votes in I.V., but encouraged the crowd — some of whom occasionally heckled her during the event — to vote and advance her instead of Porter to the November ballot against Hartmann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the previous race for the seat in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hartmann won 53.96% of the district votes, beating out Porter’s 45.79%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can get your friends and classmates to vote for me and it will not jeopardize Joan’s chances at all,” Jones said. “It will give her somebody that is a worthy opponent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her closing statement, Hartmann reiterated her positions stated during the town hall along with some of the endorsements she received, including one from the recently withdrawn candidate, Jessica Alvarez Parfrey.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will continue to lead the just transition to a green energy economy with environmental and economic benefits, I will support a more representative and inclusive county government, I will fight for progressive causes including workers’ rights and environmental justice and I will protect your safety, our water resources, our open spaces and our climate,” Hartmann said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Frontier Communications, a telecommunications company; and Utility Tree Service (UTS), a tree trimming company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, SoCal Edison entered into a “special use permit” (SUP) agreement with the federal government, agreeing to maintain land owned by the government by trimming branches and removing trees to prevent dangerous tree collapses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To carry out the agreement, the court complaint said SoCal Edison paid a tree trimming service, Utility Tree Service, to take care of its green space. UTS specializes in “utility line clearance work” and provides services such as vegetation management and storm and emergency response, </span><a href=\"http://www.utilitytreeservice.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the company’s website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to the court complaint, UTS inspected a faulty tree but allegedly made no effort to clear the hazard. The tree later collapsed on power and communication lines, belonging to SoCal Edison and Frontier Communications respectively, and ignited adjacent vegetation, the court complaint alleged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complaint also claims that Frontier Communications improperly maintained vegetation adjacent to its communication lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brush fire soon manifested into a forest fire, engulfing an area with a length equal to the distance from </span><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedImages/countyofsb/Content/Emergencies/reyMap08-30-16.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2138648331\" data-slb-group=\"89672\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista to Montecito.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among others, alleged damages to the land include “the mitigation, rehabilitation, and reforestation of burned areas; loss of and damage to timber, habitat, wildlife, watershed and earth protection… environmental damage… soil damage and erosion,” according to the court complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the SUP signed by SoCal Edison, the electrical company is mandated to compensate the National Forest Service for any damages incurred on the land, the court complaint alleged. After almost a month, the fire was extinguished but resulted in “suppression costs and rehabilitation costs in excess of $26 million,” the court complaint read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Aug. 17, the day the court complaint was filed, SoCal Edison allegedly had not paid “any part of the sum demanded by the United States” — an amount which was not disclosed in the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoCal Edison, Frontier Communications and UTS did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November 2018, SoCal Edison </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-02/southern-california-edison-admits-to-being-a-source-of-the-thomas-fire/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">admitted to being one of the sources of the Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which swept through Ventura and Santa Barbara County between December 2017 and January 2018 and ultimately burned over 281,893 acres of land.
