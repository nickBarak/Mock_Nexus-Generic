Xavier finishes the season 32-30 and although it had a tough loss to end the season, it did finish with an impressive streak of winning 18 of its final 22 games of the season.</p>\n<p>The game was one that was put away rather quickly thanks in large part to a nine-run fourth inning for Santa Barbara. Before that frame, UCSB had not registered even one hit, yet it kept swinging away until it worked out for them.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Xavier had an early jump on the Gauchos after scoring two runs in the first inning thanks to RBI singles from sophomore catcher Nate Soria and freshman infielder Chris Givin.</p>\n<p>Then the fourth inning happened and UCSB went off. The frame consisted of two three-run home runs courtesy of sophomores Clay Fisher and Austin Bush. Bush is currently riding a hot streak of hitting a home run in each of the last three games. The Gauchos also scored thanks to RBI singles from sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier and redshirt junior center fielder Andrew Calica. An error by Xavier also led to one run for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Fisher, Calica and Bush all had solid games with each registering three hits and combining for nine RBI’s. Plantier and redshirt sophomore JJ Muno had two hits apiece and one RBI to contribute to the rout.</p>\n<p>After the nine-run frame, Santa Barbara was up 9-2. The Musketeers retaliated with one run in the bottom half of the inning to make it 9-3 but the damage was done and one team was in clear control.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scored at least one run in four of the next five innings to seal the deal and defeat the Musketeers 14-5 in order to advance to the Super Regionals for the first time in program history.</p>\n<p>Fisher, Bush, Calica and redshirt senior Justin Kelly were all named to the Nashville Regional All-Tournament Team with Bush being named the Tournament MVP.</p>\n<p>All players had great performances as Fisher went 7-15 (.467) with seven RBI’s, Calica went 6-13 with four runs, Kelly pitched a four-inning shutout with 10 strikeouts to secure the Gauchos first win against Xavier and Bush hit three home runs including a walk-off in the opening match against Washington.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s postseason campaign so far has been the best in school history, as the three wins in this regional alone are as many as they had in its past seven trips combined.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now focuses its attention to Louisville, the winner of the Louisville Regional, a team that has won 50 games this season and finished ranked fourth in the country.</p>\n<p>While it will not be easy to face such a tough opponent, the Gauchos have proven that they are a team that will do whatever it takes to win a ball game, and that is the beauty of this young team.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB is the only remaining Big West team in the tournament, and it deserves it after sweeping through the Nashville Regional. This team has come a long way but it is nowhere near satisfied until it reaches Omaha.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game will be against Louisville in the Super Regionals at Louisville Slugger Field on Saturday, June 11 at 9 a.m. PDT.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

As a student, Macias said she believes that art is commodified and generally something people cannot enjoy unless they have excess funds to pay for expensive art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just look at romance painters,” Macias said. “They were always court painters. They did portraits for royalty. They did marble statues, they painted churches, so [art] has always been a commission-based thing and it has always been commissioned by higher classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This realization led Macias to research ways to share her art with the “broke college kids” around her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to make her art more accessible, Macias puts her art on stickers, with sizes to fit Hydroflasks and lighters, and she creates poetry and art for Um…Magazine, an online student-run publication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias has fallen in love with the I.V. art community and is an artist who believes even college students should be able to appreciate art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that is what I really like about I.V. art movements. It is so inclusive,” said Macias. She found UCSB to be elitist when it comes to art projects, only allowing incredibly skilled artists to produce art around campus, yet I.V. is welcoming to all skill levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in her free time, Macias has taken up denim painting commissions – an unconventional art form not often seen in I.V. She charges between $20 and $35 for the art, depending on whether the buyer provides their own denim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like painting denim, not only because it is an easy way to get my art affordably out there, but also I feel like it makes my art mobile,” Macias explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend moving to Germany in July could not take acrylic paints with her onto the plane, so she gifted them to Macias a couple months before she left. Without a canvas and disliking the look of acrylics on paper, Macias painted on denim for the first time in the spring, adding flowers to her mother’s jacket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The denim jacket] was the coolest thing and it didn’t have any marks on it or anything. I had it all throughout high school,” Macias said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that painting on denim is surprisingly difficult in contrast to her familiar watercolors, which she considers to be the most forgiving medium due to water always being able to change the image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with denim’s rough surface, the paint needs to be combined with a mixing medium and sealed with heat to make it last through a wash, and many layers of paint are needed to produce a bright color. Macias also found that her line work needs to be more precise with acrylics than with watercolors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias noticed that people were afraid to alter their own clothing but still wanted to have personalized art, which Macias said is why she chooses to create commission-based denim rather than selling original denim creations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t feel like they have the time or the energy or skill to create something but that doesn’t mean they can’t. They just need other ways to get there and that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t reap the benefits of their own creative mind.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every girl has a pair of high-waisted jeans in their drawer,” Macias said. “Some of them are booty shorts, some of them are cut-off, but they all have some pair of high waisted denim shorts somewhere and it’s just like, ‘Why don’t you paint the back pocket?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She often encourages people to paint with her if they want to try it out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you could do that or you want to do that, then sit here and try it with me at least, and if we mess up, Livi can try to fix your shorts,” said Macias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with Vincent van Gogh’s famous paintings “Starry Night” and “Café Terrace at Night,” Macias finds emotion to be an important part of art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His most beautiful works were actually made when he was in recovery,” Macias explained. She added that she is troubled by society’s romanticization of mental illness and creation and finds many believe Van Gogh and other celebrated creators would not have been as gifted or talented without their mental illnesses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He portrays entire emotions of happiness and hope in those just by the use of color,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her inspiration comes from whatever she is feeling at the moment with the paper she has on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias’ previous art pieces range across many emotions, from darker works about drug use and overdose to cuter, summer works with bright yellows and golds. She keeps various notebooks with each featuring a different theme, often with as many as twenty notebooks partially filled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Art is expression…and that’s what I really want to portray in what I do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

The old Ike’s building is newer – the infrastructure and everything is better. Since [the Trigo location] doesn’t have air conditioning, our employees will feel much better at the new location.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also noted that in the winter, when it rains more often, his customers didn’t have a place to sit since the current location is limited to outdoor seating. He added that Mojo looks forward to being able to provide indoor seating at the new location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before setting up shop on Trigo, Wang had been skeptical about the location. “When I first came here, even my employees said, ‘You made a bold move coming into this location.’ I had seen it change hands between 805 Kabob and Café International a couple times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang cited lack of kitchen space at the current location as another important factor in the move. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The space [at the current location] is limited and people are often complaining about us not being able to keep up with their demand. So, moving into a larger space gives us more storage and cooking space to turn over that demand and give customers what they need,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also hopes that being closer to campus and the more popular parts of I.V. will help with business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’m in I.V. I go walk around at different times of day and observe the busiest parts. Trigo is dead on the weekends, and the busiest street is Pardall and the area where Woodstock’s is. Sometimes people may feel like Mojo is such a long walk from there, but now, more people will be able to try us since we are closer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also heard of people having trouble finding the current location and thinks that the newer location will make for easier access, especially because many people “know Ike’s was there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ike’s closed abruptly in April and moved to a new location in downtown Santa Barbara. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/amidst-lawsuit-ikes-moves-to-state-street/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issues between the sandwich shop and the property manager, Icon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the reported presence of mold at the location, led owner Ike Shehadeh to pack up shop and move to State Street. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the status of the mold, Wang said, “I did follow up with the property owner, and they said the mold situation was resolved.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A representative from Icon Property Management declined to comment on the situation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/","id":4149,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[4148,4147,4146],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
