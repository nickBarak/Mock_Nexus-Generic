Representatives deliberated over the most effective areas to make cuts, focusing on honoraria and ongoing projects.</p>\n<p>Most of the debate centered on whether finances for the proposed A.S. Isla Vista Annex would come from unallocated funds or the budgets of various A.S. subcommittees that have already donated about $40,000 collectively. Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said requiring further funding from committees would limit their ability to function.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I don’t like taking most of it from committees,” Mayorga said. “They’ve already invested so much in the space and cutting their budget is going to hurt the work they will be doing in the space. The money should come out of unallocated [funds].”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz said funding from committees is a necessary means of determining whether or not the project is viable.</p>\n<p>“This is really a trial run — a chance for us to see if this is something beneficial so if it doesn’t work we can pull out,” Lantz said. “The committees want this to happen and will do everything in their power to see it happen.”</p>\n<p>However, Lantz said students should ultimately determine the project’s fate via a lock-in fee on next year’s Spring Election ballot.</p>\n<p>To absorb requisite cutbacks, Representative-at-Large Chloe Stryker said committee member’s honoraria should constitute a smaller portion of the association’s budget.</p>\n<p>“If you look at our budget, most of our fees are going towards honoraria,” Stryker said. “I don’t think that’s right. Members should be working out of good heart and because they want to be involved.”</p>\n<p>According to Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht, honoraria currently comprises an excessive portion of A.S. finances.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is the most expensive thing we pay for,” Lieberknecht said. “People give to this association to get something back and not just pay for our salaries.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated Finance Board’s request for $23,075 from next year’s unallocated budget, $19,000 of which would go toward the group’s honoraria. Lieberknecht said she feels such a substantial request is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>“You should cut our honoraria,” Lieberknecht said. “Most of the money requested would be going towards honoraria.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually decided to approve $21,600 for the board.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/legislative-council-discusses-years-budget/","id":3130,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3129,3128,3127],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp","biography":"Not available","articles":[3105,3127,3130,3160,3477,3485,3821],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Finance Board on Monday, Hillel sought $1,700 from the council to organize its weekly Shabbat dinners and Kosher cookouts. However, the organization intended to spend $1,100 on cleaning fees and supplies for these events and only $600 for food.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Dina Varshavsky said 14 percent of the campus community is composed of Jewish students. She said these dinners are an important part of their heritage and should receive full funding.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez, on the other hand, said Hillel’s financial request was excessive.</p>\n<p>“I understand that they want a lot of people to come to their dinners,” Lopez said. “Personally I’d like to cut it down a lot because it is very spread out and we can only fund it so many times.”</p>\n<p>The council ultimately allotted $50 to each event.</p>\n<p>Additionally, council members discussed investing $2,000 into the Chinese Internet company Qihoo 360 Tech. This investment was recommended by A.S. Investment Advisory Committee Representative Jordan Nuni and swiftly approved with no opposition.</p>\n<p>“This company is the number two browser and number one in mobile security,” Nuni said. “Their sales are up 82 percent right now and most of their money comes from advertising.”</p>\n<p>The council also recognized the resignation of Queer Commission Co-Chair Edgar Vargas.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said Vargas was initially considered for removal, but came before the council and resigned for personal reasons instead.</p>\n<p>“Basically it was a matter of internal issues about the leadership not being able to fulfill certain duties that they were expected to fill,” Del Cid said. “Eventually the commission decided the best way to do it was to ask Edgar to resign because he had other priorities in his personal life.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Duncan Kenney introduced a resolution to support the construction of a new Isla Vista annex. The community center would house 15 boards, commissions and committees — nine of which currently have no office space — computer lab and community garden, among other space for UCSB students to access in I.V. A pet project of the External Vice President for Local Affairs’ office, the building would costs $82,060 annually to operate, and needs $34,560 more to begin its initial year. The resolution was tabled indefinitely until financial issues were sorted out.</p>\n<p>Kenney said his bill was not seeking funding for the project, but a reaffirmation of Associated Students’ continued support for the plan.</p>\n<p>“It is important that we continue our support of the I.V. annex, despite some recent negative media attention,” Kenney said. “Personally, I want to make a long-term impact and this is something that will be good for committees to come and that we can come back to as alumni.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council approved three retroactive honoraria requests including $100 for Coastal Fund Graduate Representative Suzanne McFerran, $20 for the Tech Services Committee and $600 for Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis. These salaries were distributed to committee members who didn’t receive funds in a timely manner.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-21/invests-internet-talks-iv-annex-plans/","id":3127,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3126,3125,3124],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Legislative Council meeting, members approved the instatement of the HRC as an A.S. entity by a 20-1 vote. Arreola is expected to release a statement tomorrow regarding his veto of the creation of the A.S. Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Under the A.S. legal code, the President has the power to veto legislation passed by the Legislative Council if he or she does so within two business days of its adoption. In addition, the president is required to release a statement explaining the reasons for the veto within three business days of the legislation’s passage.</p>\n<p>Arreola did not return calls for comment as of press time.</p>\n<p>According to HRC Director Nicolas Pascal, Arreola’s decision to veto the bill surprised him.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been speaking with many member of the Human Rights Council, all of whom have expressed confusion and disappointment in Charlie Arreola’s seemingly bizarre decision,” Pascal said. “We haven’t yet received even one justification for his veto of an incredibly popular initiative that was passed with only one dissenting vote.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Chris Wendle, meanwhile, said he did not know the reasoning behind Arreola’s veto.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really know anything about it,” Wendle said. “I would really just wait for Charlie’s release because I don’t really know much about his decision.”</p>\n<p>As per the legal code, any legislation vetoed by the president will be automatically placed on the next week’s Legislative Council agenda. The council can override the veto by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Jasmine Davenport, who authored the HRC bill, said the council has not yet taken a stance in response to the veto.</p>\n<p>“The Legislative Council is not really sure right now where we stand,” Davenport said. “Obviously I don’t agree with it because I was the author of the bill. I am willing to work with him and other leadership of A.S. to better the bill and better the board.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-26/president-plans-veto/","id":3128,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3127,3126,3125],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Reject Bulk of Fees","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The results of the Spring Elections’ Campus Elections Commission ballot were released Friday, establishing one new fee and upholding five reaffirmations.
