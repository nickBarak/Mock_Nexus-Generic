University of California students have been ready, willing, and urging the UC to let students be a part of planning for their future.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano, when asked about the statement, said continuing a tuition freeze with current levels of state support, which she said has declined over the last decade by 27 percent per student, is not feasible.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s unfortunate language. It’s not that at all,” Napolitano said. “It’s not holding anybody hostage, this is where we are … but you can’t have a tuition freeze indefinitely at the current level of state support that we’re receiving.”</p>\n<p>According to Napolitano, given the “dramatically reduced” per student contribution by the state, the UC has been placed in a situation that necessitates a tuition increase or an increase in state funding.</p>\n<p>“The per-student contribution by the state has really been dramatically reduced. I think it’s time to say, ‘Look, we want to maintain ourself as open and accessible, maintain our student aid policy; we want to increase California enrollment and we need to invest in academic quality.’” Napolitano said. “At some point you either increase the state contribution or you have a tuition plan that goes into place.”</p>\n<p>All 10 UC chancellors, including Chancellor Henry T. Yang, also released a joint statement today in support of the proposed increase, citing continuous funding gaps and a decreased budget of $640 million in funds available to UC since 2008.</p>\n<p>“The plan addresses our obligation to students and their families to provide them with the best education possible at the most affordable price. It is predictable and fair, and it allows families to plan ahead,” the statement reads. “It is important to note that under this proposed plan, about 55 percent of our California undergraduates will continue to pay no systemwide tuition or fees.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58059\" style=\"width: 294px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1855482660\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58030\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58059\" data-attachment-id=\"58059\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucop-to-consider-tuition-increases/ucsa-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=800%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,680\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=250%2C213&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=800%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58059\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?resize=284%2C241\" alt=\"University of California Student Association released a statement yesterday condemning the proposed tuition increase, claiming as a step that it holds students' education &quot;hostage.&quot;\" width=\"284\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?resize=250%2C213&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">University of California Student Association released a statement yesterday condemning the proposed tuition increase, claiming as a step that it holds students’ education “hostage.”</p></div>\n<p>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, the UC’s largest workers union, released a statement on the proposed tuition increase, claiming that UCOP has twice the number of employees earning over $250,000 per year now as it did in 2008. AFSCME 3299 President Katherine Lybarger said the UC should reprioritize its available funding toward sources other than executive salaries and should “stop squandering millions of public dollars on oversized executive compensation and outsourcing contracts.”</p>\n<p>“The cost of these misguided priorities has already left UC facilities dangerously short staffed, and undermined the</p>\n<p>California Master Plan guarantee for thousands of qualified students in our state,” Lybarger said. “Demanding more money from students and taxpayers without first correcting the tone-deaf mismanagement that has been a catalyst for UC’s financial problems is a non-starter.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

According to statistics gathered by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZiVslx1Zpce-fvuGn8yvnFz-mH8C2ARHqoMWC8rNPs4/edit?usp=sharing\">a <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey</a> randomly sampling 376 students, 40.7 percent of students have tried some psychoactive prescription drug at least once in their life and 35 percent have tried Adderall at least once, with 25.4 percent noting that they did it specifically for school and only 1.1 percent stating that they used it specifically for ADHD.</p>\n<p>The survey has also found that some students take amphetamine stimulants such as Vyvanse, Dexedrine and Dextrostat as well as benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan to study, for recreation, to treat medical conditions or for other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta, the statistics “sound accurate,” as many students who come to Student Health seek consultation and treatment for ADHD or attention deficit disorder (ADD) either because of concerns about their condition or because they feel medication “can help them study, help them concentrate, can help them prepare for tests.”</p>\n<p>“The percentage of students who say that they have tried it are probably not using the medications as prescribed … but reporting their uses more as experimentation or [to] improve their study habits or study skills,” Kurta said, “particularly for Adderall.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, according to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey, 87.7 percent of students who have used Adderall do not have a prescription.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long … we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much. — Jackie Kurta</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kurta said she is concerned about assumptions that many students make about the projected risk of prescription drug abuse, claiming that students wrongly assume that because prescription drug use is widespread, it is safe.</p>\n<p>“These are very potent medications, and they need to be properly assessed, properly diagnosed, properly dosed and properly managed.” Kurta said. “We certainly don’t want to give people the impression that anybody can take anything and it’ll help them. There are risks.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58015\" style=\"width: 314px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"954950762\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58015\" data-attachment-id=\"58015\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5918/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415234785\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5918\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58015\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918-681x1024.jpg?resize=304%2C457\" alt=\"Lecturer Kendall Hassemer believes the use of these drugs may be due to increased academic pressure and over-stimulation of students’ current surrounding environment.

People tend to think that there’s a reduced risk with Adderall because so many people are prescribed it when really there are risks involved. You don’t know how your body will respond to it.” Peters also said she doubts many Adderall users have prescriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Are So Many Students Doing It?</strong></p>\n<p>Exercise &amp; Sports Studies 2 (ESS2)/Substance Abuse lecturer Kendall Hassemer said students are facing increasing pressure within the education system to “perform perfectly,” which sets students up for cycles of high anxiety, depression and drug-seeking behavior in order to cope with stress. According to her, these problems are symptomatic of the overstimulation students are inundated with in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that this greater focus on ADD/ADHD is due to increased awareness as well as continual nervous system exposure and overstimulation of the current surrounding environment,” Hassemer said in an email. “Research has shown that internet/communications and electronic devices alter neurotransmitter and brain function over time.”</p>\n<p>Kurta agrees and said she thinks prescription drugs are used among students who do not necessarily have behavioral conditions but in actuality need “a quick fix to be able to blast through [studying].”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s kind of a byproduct of the way our society is now operating in terms of our ability to multitask,” Kurta said. “Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long, I think we do in ourselves promote this idea that we can’t focus on any one thing when in fact we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics major Michael, with constant increase in pressures from the university to academically succeed and with pressure at internships or jobs to excel, “study drugs become more and more of a thing” as more students feel as though they must compete with one another.</p>\n<p>“The fact that students know [the dangers] and still take them, even relying on these drugs, just shows the types of environments and pressures that are put on all of the students of the U.S. education system,” he said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them … They are addictive drugs and if you abuse them, they will be detrimental and they’ll be useless in the context of academics. —Quinn</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second-year engineering major Kenneth said that while the use of study drugs may seem to help, it can create a psychological dependence that would not have been previously there.</p>\n<p>“I have heard from friends I’ve talked to that they are great and even if they don’t make you study harder they make the process more enjoyable,” he said. “On the other hand, some have said that they often think if they had never started [taking these drugs] they wouldn’t need it now.”</p>\n<p>However, according to fourth-year political science major Nikolai, the use of prescription drugs such as Adderall is not as detrimental as some claim it to be.</p>\n<p>“I take Adderall on an occasional basis and it has no apparent long-term detrimental side affects. It has certainly saved my ass on more than one occasion in an academic respect,” Nikolai said. “I feel like it won’t be the last time it will.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Quinn said she thinks that the overuse of drugs, at least at UCSB, stems not just from the pressure to succeed, but also from easy access. She said that even though these drugs are legal, “they are still, very much, drugs.”</p>\n<p>“I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58016\" style=\"width: 395px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1471172757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58016\" data-attachment-id=\"58016\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5946/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415235563\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58016\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946-1024x681.jpg?resize=385%2C256\" alt=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" width=\"385\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey found that 34.8 percent of students have used Adderall at least once and that 18.4 percent of students have used Xanax at least once. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Fixing the Symptoms Instead of Solving the Problem<br>\n</strong><br>\nAccording to Kurta, a lot of students that come to the Alcohol &amp; Drug program find themselves turning to not just “study drugs,” but also to anti-anxiety medication such as Xanax in order to feel relief from stress or trauma.</p>\n<p>“They do talk about the fact that some of their use is prompted by a feeling of some relief from stress, relief from anxiety — many from feelings of depression, or loneliness or traumatic situations that have occurred,” Kurta said.</p>\n<p>Peters agreed and said that widespread use of benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan can lead to detrimental and even possibly fatal results.</p>\n<p>“With Xanax, a lot of people think its fine since it’s so widely prescribed for anxiety, not realizing they’re very potent,” Peters said, “especially when accidentally or purposefully mixed with alcohol, it can be deadly.”</p>\n<p>According to Hassemer, our continuously competitive academic environment coupled with college students’ natural inclination to experiment are both elements that factor into student inclination to abuse pharmaceutical drugs.</p>\n<p>“The high-stress environment of a college campus, linked with exposure to prescription drugs, and even natural curiosity of this age group, makes it more likely for experimentation and dangerous, even life-threatening habits to form,” Hassemer said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening. And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them. — Sir Ken Robinson</p></blockquote>\n<p>So let’s say school is the problem. Then what? When all is said and done, is there anything anyone can do to mitigate the prescription drug problem?</p>\n<p>According to notable author, speaker and international advisor in education Sir Ken Robinson in a Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts (RSA) lecture titled “Changing Education Paradigms,” diagnosis of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing, a phenomenon which he said is no coincidence.</p>\n<p>“Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth,” Robinson said in the lecture. “They’re being besieged with information and calls for their attention from every platform — computers, from iPhones, from advertising hoardings, from hundreds of television channels — and we’re penalizing them now for getting distracted. From what? Boring stuff at school, for the most part.”</p>\n<p>Robinson, who points out that the public school system was modeled to meet the needs of industrialism in the 19th century, advocates for a reassessment of our current education model in order to meet 21st century standards. He also points to Ritalin and Adderall as “quite dangerous drugs” given to students to force them to focus in a model of education that is outdated.</p>\n<p>“And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening,” Robinson said. “And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, the increased usage of prescription drugs points to a necessity to change the educational paradigm. This means doing away with Industrial Age methods of schooling such as ringing bells, separate facilities specialized into separate subjects and separating school children by age. Instead, Robinson states that we must start looking at ways to encourage creativity and divergent thinking into the school system.</p>\n<p>Whether his advice rings true or not, one thing is for certain — a significant chunk of students are medicating themselves in order to get by, and unless either students or school systems change, prescription drugs are here to stay.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zDZFcDGpL4U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>This story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s. </em><em>Some names in this article have been changed on condition of anonymity.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/","id":3436,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[3435,3434,3433],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The bill was created earlier this year and was first presented to the Senate last Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The bill details the function of the new A.S. Campus Student Advocacy Unit to “provide free and confidential peer support, advice, and assistance to any student, student organization, or student group involved in a dispute with any entity within the University community.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Garcia said the idea for the bill arose when fourth-year sociology and psychology major and A.S. President Ali Guthy expressed concerns about the structure and operation regarding the OSA.</p>\n<p>“The concern regarding the current structure and operation of the office was ultimately this: if the Student Advocate General is meant to advocate for the entire student body as a whole, how can the elected individual, properly advocate for the rights of the whole student body when only dealing with on-campus issues such as plagiarism and dormitory write-ups?” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>Guthy said that while the OSA conducts specific casework for individual students who encounter disciplinary problems on campus, there could be a better way to serve all students.</p>\n<p>“This type of individualized service is not offered by any other elected executive officer or their staff, considering there are alternative structures within the association that serve to facilitate this need,” Guthy said in an email. “As executives, I believe it is the responsibility of our offices and ourselves to advocate for all UCSB students as opposed to assisting with individual cases because we are elected by the entire student body.”</p>\n<p>Second-year CC] literature major, SAG candidate and current OSA outreach coordinator Ethan Reul said that without casework, the OSA would operate like an “umbrella” for other advocacy groups and would be saddled with additional responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“The SAG would then be responsible for the oversight and management of all these advocacy groups as well as kind of advocating on a more university-wide level as opposed to just the on-campus issues that the OSA currently deals with,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also said this new CSA unit would settle in with other advocacy units on campus and broaden the spectrum of student support, which already includes the Legal Resource Center and the Isla Vista Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>“The new unit this bill seeks to create, Campus Student Advocacy (CSA), will fit perfectly within this structure as the CSA would conduct casework to assist students who receive on-campus violations,” Guthy said in an email. “The formation of the CSA would create a holistic approach and structure for advocacy in associated students, as the ‘Advocacy Units’ would now address housing issues, off-campus issues, and on-campus issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, this bill would better serve students because it would provide a more cohesive relationship among groups on campus striving to help students.</p>\n<p>“For me, the biggest reason is that this bill proposes a new model that will facilitate a more positive, synchronized relationship between the SAG and now multiple advocacy groups, specializing in different aspects of student rights,” Guthy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS literature major and former SAG Bailey Loverin said the new bill could take the OSA “five steps backwards” from when it was previously restructured.</p>\n<p>“The new unit will not have the administrative clout of the OSA under the SAG, the SAG will be reduced to a figurehead position, confidentiality could be seriously compromised, you can’t guarantee non-partisan chairs so students could feel unsafe going to the unit, you can’t force them to attend office hours and meetings, the list goes on,” Loverin said in an email.</p>\n<p>Reul said Guthy had initially brought the bill to the OSA, but after the OSA decided not to split the office, Guthy went ahead and presented the bill to the senate. While there was some debate between the two, it ultimately met with compromise.</p>\n<p>“Ali went ahead and decided that she wanted to present it to senate anyway. Technically, it was a professional courtesy that she brought it to us; she did not need to,” Reul said. “However, because she did, we were kind of put off by the fact that she went ahead and did it anyway. So we kind of got into a bit of a heated argument with her and we came to the compromise of postponing, rather than completely eliminating or going through with the bill.”</p>\n<p>Reul said he would support the bill if it were more closely examined and revised, particularly after a new SAG is elected.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that when we do have a Student Advocate General, [they] work more closely with Ali on the creation of this bill so that way when it finally does go through, it’s in the best interest of Associated Students and the student body as a whole,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Hector Contreras said the bill in its current form could be deemed unconstitutional according to the A.S. Legal Code and that it would be best to wait until a new SAG is elected before going forward with the bill.</p>\n<p>“If the bill were to be passed as it is now, under my interpretation it would be unconstitutional because it is preventing the Student Advocate General from providing oversight and direction to their office as there is no current elected SAG,” Contreras said in an email.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57926\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57926\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/","id":3437,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[3436,3435,3434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2014 Midterm Election Results: Capps, Williams Re-elected, GOP Takes Senate","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara County Clerk-Recorder’s Office released its final numbers shortly after 11:30p.m. on election day yesterday evening, posting results for state, federal, and local contests relevant...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57922\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57922\" data-attachment-id=\"57922\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/election-day-by-anna-kodelashvili_for-11-04-2014w-5758/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,798\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415125289\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.04\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Election Day by Anna Kodelashvili_for 11.04.2014w-5758\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57922\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758-1024x680.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"Lois Capps, who has retained her seat in the House of Representatives, visited campus yesterday to urge students to vote.

Abboud, at 22 years old, is the youngest trustee ever elected to the board.</p>\n<p>Statewide ballot propositions 1, 2 and 47 also passed, while propositions 45, 46 and 48 all failed by large majorities. Proposition 1, which passed with 66.7 percent of the vote, authorizes roughly $7 billion in general obligation bonds toward water infrastructure projects, while Prop 2, which passed with 68.8 percent of the vote, amends the California Constitution to require annual transfer of state general fund revenues to a “budget stabilization account,” with half the funds to be used to pay off state debts while the other half will be used in the case of “emergencies” or budget deficits. Prop 47, which passed with 58.4 percent of the vote, reduced the penalties for certain drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors.</p>\n<p>Proposition 45, which requires the state’s Insurance Commissioner’s approval before a health insurer can change its rates, failed to get more than 40.1 percent of the vote. Proposition 46, which required drug testing for physicians, also went down with 67.2 percent of voters saying no.</p>\n<p>In national elections, the Republicans picked up seven seats in the U.S. Senate, gaining a majority in that house for the party for the first time since 2007. The GOP also picked up 13 seats in the House of Representatives, placing majorities in both houses of Congress in control of the Republicans.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57929\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57929\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/","id":3438,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3437,3436,3435],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
