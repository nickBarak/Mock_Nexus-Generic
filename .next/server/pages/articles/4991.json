Whether it be service, attacking or blocking errors, Santa Barbara has had its fair share of self-inflicting mistakes on both sides of the net as it is responsible for a conference-leading 84 errors.</p>\n<p>A majority of these miscues can be attributed to the Gauchos’ mix of experienced and newcomer players adjusting to one another so only time will tell. UCSB is is need of its role players to emerge when opponents begin to key in on it pair of strikers.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the gameplay, containing the streaky start of Gauchos’ outside hitters Lindsay Ruddins and Chloe Allen will be a challenging task.</p>\n<p>Big players step up in big games and Ruddins did exactly that in UCSB’s five-set clash against the No. 15 Florida St. Seminoles last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Ruddins outshined the competition with a career-high 36 kills performance to earn the second all-time slot in UCSB history for single-match kills, two short of former Gaucho Roberta Gehlke’s all-time record of 38 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s redshirt second-year outside stud holds this season’s NCAA-high in single-match kills. Ruddins achievement of the 36 kills mark is a feat that no more than three players have recorded in a match in the past four seasons.</p>\n<p>However, Ruddins did not play in the Gauchos’ last outing against Baylor due to undisclosed reasoning.</p>\n<p>Complementing Ruddins success is Allen, who is coming into her own to begin the season. Already embracing a larger role in her sophomore year, Allen made a splurge facing the Florida St. as well with a career-high 24 kills to complete her double-double of 15 digs. She is the only Gaucho with at least two double-figure kills totals in a match.</p>\n<p>Such momentous play should help further establish the Gauchos search for offensive rhythm. While underestimating an opponent is never a wise judgment, UCSB’s first matchup of the tournament against Montana St. may be the perfect ‘pick me up’ to get things rolling.</p>\n<p>Overlooking the Bobcats would be dangerous as they possess a veteran roster in which 13 of the team’s 16 players have been in the program for two years or less; it is a class that includes six freshmen.</p>\n<p>Currently one match victory away from the .500 mark, Montana St. will hope to steer itself onto a winning track as the history of past seasons have been daunting.</p>\n<p>The Bobcats have not had a winning season since 2012-13, in which they went 15-14, 9-11 in Big Sky play, and have not surpassed more than seven wins since then.</p>\n<p>It has been a process of rebuilding for MSU as former Assistant Coach Daniel Jones is now serving as the program’s interim Head Coach. Making things a little easier for Jones and his staff on the court is the trio of outside hitters the program has.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the triad is a young and fairly fresh group consisting of freshman Evi Wilson alongside sophomores Chase Doughty and Natalie Passeck. Each has at least 20+ kills, providing MSU with an array of scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Aside from the points scored at the net, it has been the little things that have worked to the advantage of the Bobcats as well. Leading them has been freshman libero Alexis Goroski, and her success from behind the service line.</p>\n<p>MSU recorded 21 service aces in its season opening weekend, making it 33<sup>rd</sup> in the nation in the statistical category. Goroski’s eight service aces tie her for 20<sup>th</sup> in the nation and second in the Big Sky Conference.</p>\n<p>While kills, blocks, and digs typically are the most important advantage to pursue as a team, it seems like the minor dimensions of the match such as errors, service aces and more will determine how both UCSB and Montana St. perform <span data-term=\"goog_785148202\">on Friday</span>.</p>\n<p>The weekend will continue and conclude with doubleheader matches against Pacific and host Utah St.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss of one of the program’s best players in school history, Lexi Elman, who joined U.S. Olympian Elaina Oden as one of only two Tiger players ever to notch 1,200 or more career kills and digs; Pacific has held its own through four matches.</p>\n<p>The Tigers are currently on a two-match winning streak and has been striking the ball with no hesitation to much success. In three of its four matches, Pacific has hit at least a .300+ clip, the highest being .430 in its sweep of Idaho last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, it is a home opening weekend for the Aggies. Utah St. opened its non-conference schedule at the Arkansas Classic.</p>\n<p>Helping guide the Aggies to consecutive wins in the team’s first two matches was senior outside Lauren Anderson.</p>\n<p>Her totals of 41 kills, 4.10 kills per set average, 18 digs, five blocks and five service aces led Utah St. to the tournament’s finale as Anderson was selected to the Arkansas Classis All-Tournament team. She fell one kill short of tying her career-high of 23 kills in a win over Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Montana St. at <span data-term=\"goog_785148203\">3 p.m.</span> on Friday, Sept.1.

The driving force behind SMU’s prosperous rise is senior setter Avery Acker.</p>\n<p>A two-time All-American Honorable Mention, Acker leads the American Athletic Conference in assists per set with 11.96. She helped the Mustangs win their five-set battle versus New Mexico last Saturday with a season-high 58 assists. Her career total of 3,000 plus assists ranks her sixth all-time in SMU history.</p>\n<p>Another key counterpart to the Mustangs success is junior Morgan Heise. The 2014 American Athletic Libero of the Year, Heise set an SMU single-season record with 626 digs. The Mustangs 17.70 digs per set ties them with UCF for a conference-high this season.</p>\n<p>Expect another MVP-esque performance from senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau to combat SMU’s fierce defense. The Yale Invitational Co-MVP, Barbeau leads the Gauchos in kills with 81 and is just one dig away from being tied for second on the team at 58 after recording a career-high 18 digs against Yale.</p>\n<p>“Our serving improved, which helps our defense,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “It puts more pressure on other teams and makes it easier for our defense to set up for digs and blocks.”</p>\n<p>Next on Santa Barbara’s schedule is the University of San Diego. UCSB’s first ranked opponent, the 5-1 Toreros are also on a four-game winning run after hosting its own invitational last weekend.</p>\n<p>Leading USD in its superb home performance was redshirt junior middle blocker Lisa Kramer. She was awarded with All-Tournament honors after accumulating a total of 30 kills, 12 blocks, and a .397 hitting percentage. Kramer is currently tied for the team-lead in attacking percentage at a clip of .286.</p>\n<p>Having a breakout season for San Diego is junior middle blocker Lauren Schad. She finished last weekend with a total of 19 blocks and owns a team-high of 38. Her mastery of the block ranks her at the top of the West Coast Conference as she averages 1.68 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>Securing the net for the Gauchos are junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield. Grunt’s 6’4” stature along with Sheffield’s vertical bounce have complimented each other well so far this year. The two have combined for a total of 48 blocks this season.</p>\n<p>Since losing last week’s tournament finale to Rhode Island, UCSB has been more proactive in preparing for its upcoming matches.</p>\n<p>“We really pinpointed certain things that we need to work on to make sure that we don’t make the same errors again,” Sheffield said. “We’re going to make sure that we figure out what those teams are really good at doing and make sure that we can shut it down.”</p>\n<p>Ending the Gauchos’ home debut is a contest versus UCLA. The Bruins’ come into UCSB with a 4-1 overall record and are on a three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>As one of eight nationally ranked teams from a talented Pac-12 Conference, UCLA will be no easy exit for the Gauchos. A transfer from West Virginia this offseason, junior outside hitter Jordan Anderson has been an absolute stud in her first season as a Bruin. Her efficiency when attacking has been valuable to UCLA’s offense as she ranks third in the Pac-12 in kills per set averaging 4.38.</p>\n<p>UCSB definitely has its work cut out for itself this weekend. Some may consider UCSB to be the underdog even on home territory, but should not be underestimated when playing in the Thunderdome as the possibility of an upset awaits.</p>\n<p>UCSB starts its invitational tomorrow, Sept. 11<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m. versus SMU. Followed by a Saturday match versus No. 18 USD at 4 p.m., and a Sunday bout versus No. 17 UCLA at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/ucsb-set-to-host-in-home-opener/","id":4988,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4987,4986,4985],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looking To Overcome Tough Losses and Win Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a tough loss that knocked them out of contention of the No. 1 seed, the Gauchos are ready to bounce back and try to win the Big West Tournament which will be hosted at home at Campus Pool.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Endless hours spent in the pool and long weekends of game after game have all concluded to this point of the year: the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70392\" style=\"width: 379px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70392\" data-attachment-id=\"70392\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/christinademarzo_wwaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70392\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_9-web.jpg?resize=369%2C244\" alt=\"Attempting to score, Samantha Murphy shoots the ball.

In the first encounter, which took place roughly two weeks ago, the Gauchos dominated the second half of the match to give UCSB the 6-4 win on its Senior Day.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore had quite the match that day as she scored a pair of goals, drew three ejections and had three assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Not to be overlooked, however, was senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw, who put up her fourth consecutive double-figure saves performance with a total of 13 blocks against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Despite their early victory over the Matadors, the Gauchos cannot let their past victory over the Matadors give them a false sense of confidence. The Big West Tournament is a thing of its own, regardless of the predetermined seedings, as every team comes in with a brand new slate, and anything can happen.</p>\n<p>“That [tournament seeding] still does not mean anything; they are going to come out, and they are a great team,” redshirt senior Lauren Martin said. “So, this week, we have been dedicating some practice time to watching game film, scouting and watching the players that they have and refreshing on what they do on offense and what they do on defense and how we can beat that.”</p>\n<p>Efficiency on the offensive side of the pool will prove to be crucial to Santa Barbara’s chances at a victory. In their last game of the season against Long Beach State, the Gauchos were unable to convert their shots into goals and it cost them the win despite outshooting the Beach 23-13. The team will rely on its top scorers in junior utility Miranda Schrader, Hudson and Martin, who leads the team with a total of 45 goals.</p>\n<p>Martin has proven to be an essential component to the team’s offense. The Fresno native has consistently initiated scoring runs for the Gauchos that have allowed them to secure a lead early in games. Aside from marking the pace, Martin has come in clutch with game-winning goals time after time throughout the season.</p>\n<p>As for the Matadors, they, too, possess an impact player of their own. A freshman attacker from Murrieta, Madeleine Sanchez, leads the Big West with an impressive amount of 71 goals in her first season.</p>\n<p>She also leads the team with a high of 42 assists. Santa Barbara’s defense will have their work cut out for them trying to find a way to get this powerful attacker off her game right away.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the Big West Tournament at Campus Pool starting on Friday afternoon. UCSB will face CSUN this Friday, April 28 at 2 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>If Santa Barbara defeats CSUN, it will go on to face Long Beach State on Saturday, April 29 in a rematch that could send either team to the championship game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-looking-to-overcome-tough-losses-and-win-big-west-tournament/","id":4989,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4988,4987,4986],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Slumping Gauchos In Search of a Win Going Into Pepperdine Matchup","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017.01.27_StephenManga_MensVB-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017.01.27_StephenManga_MensVB-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently in a slump, the UCSB men's volleyball team will look to overcome is strong of losses in its match against Pepperdine.

Those losses, particularly a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Long Beach last Thursday, haven’t been pretty, but they give Pepperdine a sterling resume when combined with wins over top teams like Loyola-Marymount of Chicago and USC.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore David Wieczorek has led the Waves’ attack this season, leveraging his 6-8 frame into 3.81 kills per set on a sparkling .390 attack percentage. Second to Wieczorek is sophomore Michael Wexter, who isn’t far behind with 3.20 kills per set himself, and a team-leading 12 service aces.</p>\n<p>“(Pepperdine) has two main guys on their attack,” UCSB head coach Dan McLaughlin said. “Wieczorek is a big outside hitter, he’s their premiere attacker, and Wexler is the other guy on the outside as well.”</p>\n<p>Wieczorek and Wexter have senior setter Joshua Stewart to thank for setting the majority of their kills up. Stewart leads the team with 230 assists, and he’s in the top 20 nationally with 9.58 assists per set.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the Waves’ success in recent games has been their ability to let opposing teams do their work for them. Both Cal Baptist and USC outkilled Pepperdine – USC did so by a 64-51 margin – but in both games the Waves committed far fewer errors than their opponents. The error differential in both games was enough to give Pepperdine the edge despite their kills deficit.</p>\n<p>Blocks have been similarly important to Pepperdine’s victories this year. The Waves outblocked Cal Baptist and USC by a combined 23-8.5 margin, an advantage that gave them more flexibility to overcome their lack of kills.</p>\n<p>“(Pepperdine) blocks well,” McLaughlin said. “They do that, and they’re really well coached. (Pepperdine head coach Marv Dunphy) is one of the best coaches in the country.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s strengths – errors and blocks – are good news for UCSB. During their losing streak, the Gauchos haven’t been killed on blocks, or committed too many errors. Opponents on the attack, an area in which the Waves have not put up standout numbers, have done most of the damage instead.</p>\n<p>Just last Saturday, for instance, the Gauchos were unable to find an answer for the Hawaii attack. The Rainbow Warriors rode a .357 hitting percentage to a 3-1 win, overriding strong performances from both redshirt senior Jacob Delson (23 kills) and Corey Chavers (18 kills).</p>\n<p>Service is likely to be another crucial area in Wednesday’s matchup. Both teams have struggled with their serves and serve receptions in recent games, and whichever team has that figured out by Wednesday will have a key advantage.</p>\n<p>“We mostly need to serve better,” McLaughlin said. “That hasn’t been great the past four games (…) We’re going to rely on our serve reception guys, because if we pass well we have a good shot at winning.”</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Pepperdine in Malibu on Wednesday night at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-07/slumping-gauchos-in-search-of-a-win-going-into-pepperdine-matchup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-07/slumping-gauchos-in-search-of-a-win-going-into-pepperdine-matchup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-07/slumping-gauchos-in-search-of-a-win-going-into-pepperdine-matchup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-07/slumping-gauchos-in-search-of-a-win-going-into-pepperdine-matchup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-07/slumping-gauchos-in-search-of-a-win-going-into-pepperdine-matchup/","id":4990,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4989,4988,4987],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
