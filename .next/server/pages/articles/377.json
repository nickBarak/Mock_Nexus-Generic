The Rainbow Warriors meanwhile improved to an impressive 13-2 overall and 2-0 start in Big West play, extending their current winning streak to five. They are 9-1 in through their last 10 outings.</p>\n<p>Both teams struggled with their shooting out of the gates, matching each other at 33.3 percent from the field in the first half. Although the Gauchos took a slim 28-27 lead into halftime behind 10 first half points from senior guard Michael Bryson, UCSB could not find a way to sustain a lead the rest of the way.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sophomore guard Gabe Vincent knocked down his third three-pointer of the half and career-high fifth of the night with 3:57 remaining to bring Santa Barbara within a point at 58-57, but the Rainbow Warriors went on a 7-0 run to close out the game, including 5-6 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>A huge lay-up to beat the shot clock by junior center Stefan Jankovic with under a minute remaining put Hawai’i up 61-57, and the Gauchos were unable to answer in their final possessions, falling 65-57.</p>\n<p>Hawai’is Isaac Fleming led all players with 22 points, matching Vincent by hitting 3-5 from deep in the second half. For the game, the sophomore guard went 7-13 from the field and 5-5 from the free throw line. Jankovic was solid the entire night, putting up 19 points on an efficient 9-14 from the field to go along with nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite playing every minute of the game, Hawai’i senior guard Roderick Bobbitt had a rough shooting night, making just 1-10 shots, but still managed a decent output with six points, seven boards and four assists.</p>\n<p>The free throw disparity in the second half favored Hawai’i 13-2 in attempts and played a big part in the UCSB loss as it has all season. At the start of conference play, the Gauchos ranked last in attempts by a wide margin at just 199 through 15 games, while Hawaii had already surpassed 330 attempts.</p>\n<p>While the offense struggled as a group, Bryson and Vincent were able to keep UCSB in it until late. Bryson finished with his second consecutive double-double and fourth of his career with 16 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Vincent, whose only made field goals came from behind the arc, continued his hot shooting of late as he made 5-9 from three on his way to 17 points. He has now made 15 of his last 31 three-point attempts (48.4 percent) over the last five games.</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded its opponent 39-37 for the night but shot itself in the foot with turnovers. The Gauchos turned the ball over 19 times compared to just 12 by the Rainbow Warriors, who outscored UCSB 23-10 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be back in action this Thursday when they face Blue-Green rival Cal Poly on the road before coming back to face UC Irvine this Saturday at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/gauchos-winning-streak-comes-to-end-in-conference-opener-at-hawaii/","id":377,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[376,375,374],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Chiefs Headed for Underdog Cinderella Run?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image.jpg?resize=355%2C193&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image.jpg?resize=600%2C193&ssl=1","description":"The Kansas City have not won a playoff game in 22 seasons.

How could you not enjoy seeing Steph Curry become one of the best basketball players in the world after almost being cut a few years earlier because he could not stay healthy?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In short, we love underdogs because many of us see our ownselves as the underdog. That is why we root so hard for these incredible stories. And there is no doubt that Eric Berry and the 2015-2016 Kansas City Chiefs are that underdog this year in the NFL.</p>\n<p>On October 12, 2015 Chief fans—and my fantasy football team—were crushed by the devastating news the star running back Jamaal Charles was out for the season with a torn ACL. Six days later Kansas City lost its week six match-up against the Vikings dropping its record to 1-5.</p>\n<p>At the time, their chances of making the playoffs was zero percent. Hope seemed gone, analysts said they were done, fans were hoping for a high draft pick and management was hoping they would get to keep their jobs. That’s when safety Eric Berry stepped up.</p>\n<p>Berry knows all about overcoming adversity. In 2011, after a solid rookie campaign, the former Tennessee safety tore his ACL and was out for the season. He ultimately came back in 2012 and continued his great play and became recognized as one of the best young safeties.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in late 2014 tragedy struck Berry again, but this time much worse, as he was diagnosed with Lymphoma. Once again, he fought back. “Fear nothing, attack everything.” This is what Berry said right after he beat cancer less than a year later. He was playing by the second week of the regular season.</p>\n<p>Just like Berry, The Chiefs chose to fight for what they truly wanted, a playoff spot and a chance to win their first Super Bowl since 1969. By the end of week 16, that dream came true. After defeating the Browns on December 27th, Kansas City secured the fifth seed in the AFC.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have rallied off 10 straight victories and are a team that everybody would like to avoid. They are giving up 13.2 points per game since week 5 something that has only been accomplished five times the turn of the century, of which two of those teams made it to the conference championship.</p>\n<p>Another reason for the great defensive play is the emergence of rookie Marcus Peters. In 2014, the Chiefs defense combined for six interceptions on the season. In 2015, Peters had eight interceptions by himself.</p>\n<p>It also helps that Quarterback Alex Smith is playing the best football of his career this year. He has already set career highs in yards and advanced metrics like Total QBR. And even without its star RB, Kansas City still ranks 6th in the NFL in rushing behind Charcandrick West.</p>\n<p>Analysts make the case that the reason for the Chiefs rise is the fact that their schedule got easier after week 7. Since then, the combined records of the 10 teams Kansas City has played is 67-91. However, it should be noted that this is the NFL, no game is an “easy” win. The Chiefs had to win 10 straight games, a feat that only on two other NFL teams accomplished therefore implying this isn’t something that happens everyday.</p>\n<p>I’ll repeat that by week six Kansas City had a zero percent chance of making the playoffs and were 300:1 odds in Vegas to make the Super Bowl. Fast forward to today and the Chiefs are in the playoffs with now 14:1 odds to make the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I am wrong for assuming most teams would’ve given up once your record falls to 1-5 in the NFL and that most fans were already ready for the next season. However, when your team leader is a man who overcame a devastating illness that kills millions of people each year, how could you ever possibly justify giving up on him and on the season?</p>\n<p>The Chiefs did something that has only been done once in NFL history and that is make the playoffs after starting the season 1-5 or worse. Eric Berry did something that, unfortunately, many people cannot do, and that is beat cancer. Both underdogs will be looking to end the long 22-year drought without a playoff win that has plagued Kansas City and its fans.</p>\n<p>Something tells me this is the year that its going to happen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Louisiana-Lafayette outrebounded UCSB 37-22.</p>\n<p>The abundance of turnovers led to no Gaucho player tallying double-figures in scoring. Santa Barbara never led in Tuesday’s game and its slew of seven turnovers in the first quarter spurred the Ragin’ Cajuns’ 12-0 run to take a 17-4 lead. Louisiana- Lafayette’s backcourt was active early as senior point guard Kia Wilridge totaled eight points in the quarter while junior guard Jaylyn Gordon scored six to help the team go up 20-10 heading into the second quarter. Wildridge finished with a game-high 14 points as Gordon was just one point shy of her teammate at 13.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB remained committed to scoring its points in the paint, helping it to achieve such a high field goal percentage. More than half of Santa Barbara’s points occurred from buckets down low as it scored 22 of its points in the paint. Leading UCSB in scoring was freshman guard Coco Miller with eight points on 3-6 shooting from the field, 2-5 from behind the three-point line. She also had a career-high five steals.</p>\n<p>However, the Ragin’ Cajuns held the Gauchos scoreless for nearly four minutes during the second quarter. A make at the free throw line by junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe ended the Gauchos’ scoring drought but Louisiana-Lafayette still went into halftime with an 11-point lead of 30-19.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s cold shooting continued in the second half, not making its first field goal until the 5:11 mark of the third quarter from a Miller jumpshot.</p>\n<p>Helping Louisiana-Lafayette expand its lead in the third quarter was the production of senior guard Keke Veal off the bench. She scored the team’s last six points to end the quarter, ending the game with 12 points on 6-16 shooting, four rebounds, and a team-high four steals to give La.-Lafayette a 42-30 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Veal’s 12 points was the primary source for Louisiana-Lafayette outscoring UCSB 22-10 in bench points.</p>\n<p>Scoring spurts throughout the final quarter helped UCSB to trim the Ragin’ Cajuns’ lead but was not enough as they gained their largest lead of 24 with 2:01 left in regulation. They outscored UCSB 23-12 over the final 12 minutes of the game.</p>\n<p>In spite of allowing UCSB to record a 47.1 field goal percentage, Louisiana-Lafayette concluded Tuesday with a 44.6 field goal percentage on 22 more shot attempts than UCSB from the field to earn the 61-42 win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were outrebounded 29-43 against LSU, but it wasn’t just their lack of boards that resulted in their 68-50 victory over UCSB.</p>\n<p>A career night by senior forward Akilah Bethel guided the Tigers to victory. She scored a career-high 18 points in addition to nine rebounds and tied careers high in assists (5), steals (4) and made field goals (8) to earn Louisiana Sports Writers Association player of the week honors.</p>\n<p>Despite its field goal percentage of 34 percent to end the game, UCSB only trailed by two at 22-24 with 1:53 left in the first half. But, a jumpshot by Bethel sparked LSU’s 6-0 run to close the second quarter to take a 30-22 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in scoring was senior guard Jasmine Ware as she finished with 10 points but certainly her performance alone was unsuitable to trim the Tigers’ lead to single-digits.</p>\n<p>The third quarter signaled the emergence of sophomore guard Jenna Deemer. She went scoreless in the second quarter after recording six points in the first but was 3-6 from three-point range on an overall 6-11 shooting effort to finish with 16 points, helping give LSU a 48-33 lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 42.9 field goal percentage in the fourth was its best shooting performance of the afternoon. Yet, it was a performance that was overshadowed by the outstanding 66.7 field goal percentage that the Tigers obtained in the quarter to secure the 68-50 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s last away non-conference game is a rematch at Santa Clara this Friday, Dec. 18<sup>th</sup> at 6:00 p.m. in Leavey Center.

La Verne is now on a three-game losing streak, landing the Leopards with a 2-5 record.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, Santa Barbara outscored its opponent in each quarter of a game. The first quarter of Sunday’s game resulted in UCSB outscoring La Verne 18-8. It was the first start of the season for senior forward Kendra Morrison, who scored UCSB’s first two field goals of the game to ignite its 12-2 run.</p>\n<p>The emergence of Miller, sophomore guard Makala Roper and senior guard Jasmine Ware helped UCSB build upon its lead in the second quarter. Miller and Roper provided two three-pointers each with Miller scoring eight and Roper six in the quarter while Ware scored eight points off the bench. Both Miller and Ware registered career-highs in assists as Miller finished with five and Ware had six, respectively.</p>\n<p>A make from beyond the arc by junior guard Faye Osburn brought La Verne within 10 points of the Gauchos’ lead of 27-17, causing a UCSB timeout. However, the scoring combination of Miller and Ware helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 43-22 at halftime as the two scored the team’s last 12 points to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>Providing balance to the Gauchos’ tremendous offense was their stingy defense which held the Leopards to a 23.7 field goal percentage and 16.7 three-point percentage. UCSB held La Verne to just eight points in the paint. Sophomore forward Taylor Farris played a key role in the Gauchos’ denial of points down low. She tied her career-high of four blocks and recorded a career and game-high of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>It was a similar tale in the second half as the Gauchos opened the third quarter with a 6-0 run. Despite senior guard Shannon Irwin and junior forward Noelle Cobb scoring 13 points each, La Verne was unable to contain UCSB’s offensive attack. In addition to its control of the paint, Santa Barbara’s second unit was seemingly unstoppable outscoring the Leopards 42-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB outscored La Verne 47-19 in the second half. As the fourth quarter ended, the Gauchos’ largest lead of 51 points helped them to cruise to their 89-41 victory.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game was the first of four-straight home games for UCSB. Santa Barbara will host Morehead State next Monday, Dec. 28<sup>th</sup> at 7:00 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67012\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67012\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-21/gauchos-end-eight-game-losing-skid-with-89-41-victory-over-la-verne/","id":376,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[375,374,373],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
