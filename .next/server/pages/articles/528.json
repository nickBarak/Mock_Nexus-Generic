Each camp day is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Adding incentive to the camps are the scheduled appearances of NBA guest speakers — current Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson and Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon — who were both former University of Arizona stars during Pasternack’s tenure with the program.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to link Coach Pasternack’s former players at Arizona that have had a bunch of success,” Miller said. “Also, to show the community that those are the type of players that we’re looking to bring here: high quality, character kids that are successful on and off the court. It will be good for them to speak to the kids and let them know about basketball but also about taking care of business in the classroom and community.”</p>\n<p>The city of Santa Barbara is no stranger to NBA presence as it has developed into a basketball hub over the years.</p>\n<p>With teams such as the Sacramento Kings, Memphis Grizzlies, Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers electing to have their training and minicamps at UCSB, Santa Barbara’s mellow, relaxing atmosphere has become a popular commodity amongst teams looking to work hard and develop genuine bonding.</p>\n<p>The P3 Sports Performance facility, located near the beach on the American Riviera, serves as one of the main offseason attractions to many players and teams relocating to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Defined as the “Peak Performance Project,” P3 has served as home for training and performance enhancement to an array of professional, amateur and out-of-state athletes.</p>\n<p>“With P3 being here, it’s huge for us because, NBA guys in general, we want them to come work out on our campus; we want them to come play in the gym. We want to bridge that gap,” Miller explained. “They’re all here and training, [which] is perfect because we’re less than 10 minutes away from P3. It’ll be good to be able to get NBA players to [UCSB], especially if they have time to come speak to the campers.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has even become home to the likes of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan as the hosting location to each of their youth basketball camps.</p>\n<p>With plans to reinvent the culture of UCSB men’s basketball, the team’s staff is committed to taking the program beyond the court by establishing a universal influence amongst its supporters.</p>\n<p>“We want everyone here to see what Coach Pasternack is about,” Miller said. “He’s a big guy with the kids; his own son is going to be here, so he’ll be a camper, too. He really wants to show the community that it’s not just about winning games; there’s a bigger picture. If we can get the whole community involved, that’s great. That’s what we want to do, especially with these camps so [people] can get to know him and our staff.”</p>\n<p>Determined to utilize its resourceful platform at hand, the UCSB men’s basketball coaching staff is focused on reinventing Gaucho basketball with one primary influence: a love for the game.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 27, 2017, edition of

season this past weekend at the hands of No. 4 USC on the road and No. 6 Long Beach State at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got blown out by the Trojans 14-5 on Saturday afternoon in a game where UCSB couldn’t amass much offense against a stubborn USC team. The Gauchos started the game with a goal from senior utility Chase Racich early in the first quarter, but USC then took control and never let go, with three goals in the first quarter followed by six in the second to give the Trojans a 9-2 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was a close battle as the Gauchos held the Trojans to only two goals while scoring two of their own from junior attacker Bryan Snyder and junior attacker Kevin Cappon, his second of the game. The game ended 14-5 after a goal from freshman attacker Josh Jordan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos weren’t able to make up for their loss the prior day as UCSB fell to Long Beach St. 14-12 in another close game between the two evenly matched teams. Their previous encounter saw the Gauchos win in sudden death overtime 14-13, but they weren’t able to pull through yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“For me I think we lost the game in the first half,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We gave up two or three really easy goals to them. One was a rebound goal that we should have boxed out and got the rebound, and then another one we were trying to get out of the half and we committed an offensive foul to give them a big opportunity.”</p>\n<p>After Long Beach went up 1-0, the Gauchos countered with a goal from Cappon before the 49ers ended the first quarter up 4-2. Both teams scored five goals apiece in the second quarter as the Gauchos benefited from goals by junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, junior attacker Ryan Baliani, junior two-meter Liam Gaughan and two from Snyder.</p>\n<p>Going into the second half both teams looked to continue playing physically in the close contest. It ended up being a half of missed opportunities for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The first big play of the second half was a penalty shot opportunity for the Gauchos. Snyder stepped up in the one-on-one opportunity against Long Beach St.’s junior goalie Pavo Ljepopio, and ripped a shot that hit the post.</p>\n<p>Later in the quarter the Gauchos wasted a six-on-three opportunity with a shot over the goal and continued to miss chances to put more points on the board. UCSB hit the post back-to-back in one possession, and freshman attacker Shane Hauschild was stopped on a breakaway opportunity before he was able to take a shot.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we did miss two penalties and didn’t capitalize on a six-on-three opportunity,” Wigo said. “Those were critical moments.”</p>\n<p>Entering the fourth quarter, the game was still a close contest with Long Beach St. leading 12-9. After the 49ers got an early goal in the quarter, the Gauchos pulled a goal back as Hauschild converted a penalty shot opportunity. Long Beach St. then countered with a goal of its own before Hauschild had another penalty shot. This time Ljepopio made the save, conserving his team’s four-goal lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos pushed back as they scored two goals from Cappon and senior utility Brendan McElroy to cut the deficit to two with 1:23 to go. After a couple of missed shots, the game came to a close with the score 14-12.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look towards this weekend when they face top competition at the So Cal Tournament at UCLA.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56459\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56459\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-05/gauchos-get-off-to-rough-start-in-conference/","id":525,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[524,523,522],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miami Trails Elite Dynasties of the NBA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nexus sports editor Kristen Henneman discusses the Heat's place in NBA history.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the sports world today, the worth of any player or team is based upon how many championships they own.</p>\n<p>Personal accolades and regular season awards are great, but if you can’t win rings, you can forget being considered in the conversation for the best of all time.</p>\n<p>Currently fighting to stand on the list for best franchises of all time is the Miami Heat.

More recently, Los Angeles won three-straight titles in 2000-02 behind one of the best duos in NBA history in Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Bulls have also known the glory of the three-peat twice, accomplishing it in 1991-93 and 1996-98. Chicago, of course, was led by arguably the best player to ever play the game of basketball, Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>The team standing above all however, is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics utterly dominated the basketball world in the sixties, winning eight championships in a row and 11 in 13 years from 1957-69. The master behind the success? A 6’10’’ center by the name of Bill Russell.</p>\n<p>Russell, who is underrated when it comes to listing the best players of all time, holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls, the Heat features one of the best players to ever grace a basketball court and certainly the best player currently playing the game right now: LeBron James. Miami also features the “Big Three” in James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, which has captivated audiences all over the world.</p>\n<p>The Heat’s fast-paced, flashy play and incredible talent make them one of the most entertaining teams of all time if nothing else. They also play at a time where the level of competition around the league is much higher (excluding the Eastern Conference this season).</p>\n<p>Every year now, there are a handful of teams fighting for the NBA Championship rather than just a couple teams that were powerhouses decades ago. It does make the idea of a three-peat seem even more remarkable.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when it all comes down to it, it’s all about the rings. Boston leads the NBA in championships with an incredible 17 titles. The Lakers don’t rank far behind with 16.</p>\n<p>Considering that a sports dynasty is defined as “a team that dominates its sport or league for an extraordinary length of time,” these are the two teams that should be considered dynasties.</p>\n<p>They’re always in the hunt and rarely have off years. They’re the teams everyone wants to be a part of because there’s always a good chance to make history.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Lakers and Celtics are the best teams in NBA history. Period.</p>\n<p>With that said, Chicago would have to come next on the list for ranking of the best team with six crowns, all coming in the electrifying era that was Jordan.</p>\n<p>The Jordan Era made Chicago a destination for great players and a city that desired greatness in the basketball world.

Last season at Mt. San Jacinto, Smith led his team to the quarterfinals of the California Community College State Tournament while averaging 14 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“My staff had watched him play and we just decided that we wanted to add a little bit more depth at the guard position,” Coach Williams said. “I’m very excited to add more physical, quick, aggressive, pressure type defenders to a team that I do believe is going to have the ability to be very good defensively.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the team’s depth at guard is 6’2” combo guard Gabe Vincent out of Stockton, CA. Vincent attended St. Mary’s High School and played at the highest level of AAU basketball in the state for the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very well-rounded complete guard that doesn’t really have a weakness, particularly out of high school,” Coach Williams said. “He does everything well. He’s a very good defender, very good rebounder, very good shooter and passer. He really has an extremely well balanced game.”</p>\n<p>Vincent is expected to contribute right away as a shooting guard, but has the skill set to play both the point guard and shooting guard positions.</p>\n<p>“Vincent and Smith will play right away. They’re both very ready physically to contribute. They’re strong, they’re tough, they defend,” Coach Williams said. “They’re not going to be intimidated, neither one of them, and they’re both going to be really good additions.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class is Justin Burks, a 6’6” forward out of Nevada. Burks attended Las Vegas’ Arbor View High School and also played at the highest level of AAU basketball for the Las Vegas Prospects.</p>\n<p>“He adds to the John Green-Michael Bryson type category. He’s versatile, longer, taller,” Coach Williams said. “He’s going to have to get a lot more physical and stronger but his upside is very good.”</p>\n<p>While Burks figures to need more time to adjust to the college game in comparison to Vincent and Smith, he adds versatility and the ability to play and defend the two, three and four positions on the floor.</p>\n<p>“He has a really good mid-range game, and he’s really good off the dribble getting into the paint,” Coach Williams said. “He’s pretty active chasing rebounds. Those things add a lot to us.”</p>\n<p>The three newcomers join a talented and veteran group of players headlined by Williams. Big Al led the Big West in points and rebounds per game, while ranking 12th in the nation in scoring and second nationally in rebounding.</p>\n<p>“Most everybody that’s coming here is excited playing with a guy of Al’s caliber,” Coach Williams said. We think it’s a great thing that we’re adding the pieces to play around a great player.”</p>\n<p>Rising junior guard Michael Bryson played second fiddle to Big Al last season, finishing second on the team in scoring while garnering Big West Honorable Mention. Bryson figures to start at either the shooting guard or small forward position next season.</p>\n<p>Point guard play looks to be a source of strength for the Gauchos next season, thanks in large part to rising senior Zalmico Harmon. Harmon finished last season with the second best assist-to-turnover ratio in the entire nation and finished the year with Big West Honorable Mention accolades.</p>\n<p>“We’re hopeful that Z makes as big as a jump between his junior and senior year as he did during his junior year,” Coach Williams said. “We thought he got way better as the year went on. We feel like he has a whole other level he can go to as his comfort zone in the program rises.”</p>\n<p>Also playing point will be sophomore Eric Childress and junior T.J. Taylor. Childress finished his freshman year with spectacular consistency towards the end of the season, while Taylor is a two-year starter who missed last season with a hip injury.</p>\n<p>Smith will certainly compete for point guard playing time with the trio and Vincent could even work his way into the conversation by the end of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that [Smith] would play that position over them, he’d play with them, which allows you to have two point guards on the floor like I did with Eric and Z,” Coach Williams said. “Now we’ll have five guys in the program that are very good with the ball and very good off the bounce.”</p>\n<p>The rest of UCSB’s rotation will consist of rising junior forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler, redshirt freshman forward Alex Hart and junior guard John Green. Brewe started much of the year at power forward for the Gauchos last season while Beeler provided solid backup minutes at both the four and five spots.</p>\n<p>Hart redshirted last season but brings a versatile ability to shoot the ball from outside in addition to his 6’10” frame. Green has lost most of his career to injury but has the potential to add another deadly scorer and physical presence to UCSB if he can stay healthy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 20, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55443\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55443\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/","id":527,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[526,525,524],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
