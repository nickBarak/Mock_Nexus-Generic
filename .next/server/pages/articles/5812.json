The audience experienced “Get Out” in a theater, a place that Peele found refuge in at a young age, with a new understanding as he elaborated on the challenges and triumphs of the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading up to the event, a line wrapped around the Pollock theater as fans mingled and shared their excitement. As they waited in line, students asked for extra tickets in hope of scoring a seat in one of the most highly anticipated events on campus this quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twists and reveals are Peele’s specialty. To disguise his twists, Peele uses the history of film; he takes what we expect and shatters it. Peele creates work with the audience’s reaction in mind. He explained that this mindset stems back to his comedy background in “Key and Peele.” Though he transitioned from comedy to horror, he remains conscious of the audience’s emotions and what they think is going to happen next. Still, Peele stays away from one major twist, instead focusing on a series of escalating reveals. This kept Chris’s actions smart and realistic, while also keeping the film’s rewatchability factor high as audiences would see the hidden motives and hints hidden in the first half of the film.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really nailed it with the casting,” Peele interjected as Ryan asked him how Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), Rose (Allison Williams) and Rod (Lil Rel Howery) were casted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Chris, Kaluuya impressed Peele with his work on the tv series “Black Mirror.” Peele assures the audience that Kaluuya never left his number-one choice for Chris. Kaluuya’s ability to express a full range of emotion was exactly what Peele was looking for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rose, Peele was looking for a naturalistic performer, and while her background in musical theater may seem disconnected from the horror genre, Peele knew that “theater people have a bit of psychopath in them.” In the end, Williams was perfect for both aspects of Rose’s character. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, when it came to Rod, Peele was unsure who he was writing the character for until he met Howery. When Howery auditioned, Peele described it as “imperfect.” It was tough to direct him at first, but once Peele had Howery approach the lines through the lens of his stand-up comedy background, he transformed into the charismatic, funny, witty TSA cop that we see in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sunken place: Peele expands on this idea as he goes into depth of what this place entails. He describes it as a place that encapsulates a feeling worse than death, “the feeling of being trapped in your own body for eternity with no voice.” To further explain his point, he compares it to the feeling that you have when you’re falling in your sleep and you catch yourself as you suddenly wake up. He follows this with a haunting question: “What if you didn’t catch yourself? Where would you end up?” The room fell silent as that metaphor set in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To lighten the mood, Peele talked about alternate endings. There were two endings that were filmed: an ending with Chris going to jail and the ending shown in the film. To our surprise, there was one more. This ending took place in a gated community rather than the ranch seen in the movie. In this scene, we would have seen Chris fighting with some final force as the screen goes black. The next scene reads “3 months later,” and it would have shown Rod breaking into the gated community and, to his surprise, he would see Chris. As Rod calls for Chris, Chris slowly turns and says, “I assure you, I don’t know who you’re talking to.” This ending implies that Chris lost in his last fight for freedom and has undergone the brain transplant surgery. With that said, I am glad it ended the way Peele ultimately chose. However, it is interesting to see where the ending could have gone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Q&amp;A came to a close, Peele disclosed some facts about himself that gave the audience a better understanding of who he is. He explained how when he was a kid, he would go to the movie theater after school, and he described it as his church. One movie that stuck with him was “Edward Scissorhands.” Peele explained that he appreciated the “acute vision” Tim Burton explored as every concept came together perfectly. The fact that the main character was an outcast also intrigued him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Peele continues to make movies, he will introduce themes and ideas that have never been done before. The troupe of the white savior was not represented in this film which is unheard of given that there is at least one in every film in the movie industry. After 23 days of filming and a 4.5 million dollar budget, “Get Out” has become a film that will stand the test of time and will continue to reveal the horror of liberal racism. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80997\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80997\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-13/jordan-peele-discusses-get-out-in-pollock-theater/","id":5812,"author":{"id":773,"name":"Viv Shields"},"related":[5811,5810,5809],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":773,"name":"Viv Shields","biography":"Not available","articles":[5812],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The End of the F***ing World: A Teenage Rebellion","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/EOTFW-Graphic-For-Print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/EOTFW-Graphic-For-Print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At the core of it all, they are two teens struggling with that awkward in between: they’re not quite adults and not quite kids anymore.

Yes, it’s very reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde, except that it’s not entirely. James proclaims himself as a sociopath within the first 40 seconds of the show, taking pleasure in killing small animals and self-inflicting pain (showing off an entire burnt hand to prove it). He later explains that he engages in these behaviors in order to make himself feel something after witnessing his mother’s suicide. Except now, he’s ready to move on to bigger targets. This is where Alyssa comes in, a brazen girl with a strong IDGAF attitude battling her own issues at home.</p>\n<p>The pilot wastes no time in jumping to the “boy meets girl” trope and executes it in a brilliantly humorous and blunt way; it may be one of my favorite introductions in television history.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’ve seen you skating,” Alyssa says to James in the school cafeteria. “You’re pretty shit.”</p>\n<p>James response?</p>\n<p>“Fuck off.”</p>\n<p>As the pilot progresses, we discover that while James is fantasizing about Alyssa becoming his first human murder, she begins to grow comfortable with him, even saying he’s someone she could fall in love with. If that’s not depressing, then I don’t know what is. Evidently enough, Alyssa easily sways James into ditching town with her and he goes along for the ride, as he finds it the perfect opportunity to murder her. By the end of the episode, the two hop in James’s dad’s car and embark on a road trip that promptly becomes more of an impulsive crime spree (the “armed” robbery is hands down one of my favorite scenes) as they search for Alyssa’s father.</p>\n<p>The show moves back and forth between perspectives, providing deeper insight in getting to know our antiheroine and antihero. Through the characters’ inner monologues, done wonderfully through voiceovers, we gain a deeper understanding of their personalities. James’s thoughts convey a monotone indifference to match his perpetually disturbed yet aloof façade; Alyssa, on the hand, is quite multifaceted.</p>\n<p>Despite her aggressively upfront, careless approach (throwing curses shamelessly at the world, rolling her eyes at anything and everything), thoughts expose her as vulnerable and wounded. It’s comical as viewers to watch how vastly different these two characters are; Alyssa is all nihilistic spunk and spontaneity while James is merely a bystander to all her wayward antics.</p>\n<p>At the core of it all, they are two teens struggling with that awkward in between: they’re not quite adults and not quite kids anymore. They’re brimming with a bleak resentment to an awful society, taking out their frustrations and fragilities in a manner that’s both droll and gloomy.</p>\n<p>However, what makes this story so oddly beautiful is the human connection that is made between two people who seem so, well, inhuman. It’s when Alyssa somehow finds her way back to James and when James somehow can’t bring himself to leave Alyssa in spite of her mad father — it’s these moments that display how much they’ve come to care for each other. The sinister events that follow their escape and mutual feeling of adolescent confusion tie them together, a bond that can’t be broken. No matter how deranged the story is, it’s a story of love.</p>\n<p>Overall, “The End of the F***ing World” provides all the essentials for an indie teen flick: a road trip, a banging soundtrack, running from the authorities, two underdogs we <em>really shouldn’t be rooting for</em>, but do anyway … and an honorary mention to the wardrobe change mid-season (a Hawaiian shirt makes for a perfect disguise, right?).</p>\n<p>However, all this would not be so easy to binge in an entire day if it weren’t for the compelling acting of the two leads. Barden pins the tail right on the donkey with her character; while playing a bratty teenage girl with issues sounds derivative and cliché, it’s done with a complexity one simply can’t help but love. I fear her, but I also just want to be her mom friend.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lawther’s performance is phenomenal, capturing all the subtle intricacies that make James so disconcerting and intriguing to watch (I expected nothing less after seeing him on “Black Mirror”). As each episode briskly passes by, it becomes hard to not fall for the charms of the duo.</p>\n<p>Writer Charlie Covell and director Jonathan Entwistle remarkably capture the genuine connection that evolves between Alyssa and James. It’s a fast-paced story, jumping from one mishap to another, with side narratives that thankfully do not detract from the main plot — everything is well interwoven until the very end of the series. Right when you become engrossed into this explicitly dark, dark world, it all comes to an end, and eight episodes suddenly feels far too short.</p>\n<p>It’s unlike any show I’ve seen on television; it’s the perfect storm of teenage rebellion to a heightened ending. Despite the ambiguous finale that leaves the viewer in a stupor, desperately itching for more, it’s hard to envision continuing this world after the helter-skelter chaos of one season. Bravo Alyssa and James, for making a love story truly feel like the end of the fucking world.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80675\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80675\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/","id":5809,"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul"},"related":[5808,5807,5806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2018 SBIFF Virtuosos Awards Shine Bright","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-26.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-26.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The recipients of the 2018 Virtuosos Award provided a fascinating unpredictability that had the audience on edge of their seats, ready to laugh and leaving them reluctant to leave the escape of a Holl...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Six actors were honored for their breakthrough performances in film at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) Virtuosos Award ceremony this past Saturday. After some attendees worked for hours to secure their spots outside The Arlington Theatre, the crowd’s anticipation was brought to an absolute high when they greeted the actors stepping out of their blacked-out Escalades. The camaraderie displayed amongst the group of stars was shown through moments such as John Boyega’s imitation of Pinocchio from “Shrek” to Kumail Nanjiani’s timely, comedic jabs at the other actors.</p>\n<p>This year’s Virtuosos Award recipients included Mary J. Blige (“Mudbound”), John Boyega (“Detroit”), Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me By Your Name”), Hong Chau (“Downsizing”), Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out”) and Kumail Nanjiani (“The Big Sick”).</p>\n<p>The night began with SBIFF Director Roger Durling announcing that recipient Gal Gadot (“Wonder Woman”) would not be in attendance due to a case of the flu. This did not seem to temper the audience’s excitement, as their eager faces waited to hear the rest of the lineup speak about working on their Oscar-nominated films. Dave Karger moderated the event for the eighth consecutive year and briefly spoke about the natural calamity faced by the Santa Barbara and Montecito communities. “I know that it has not been an easy few months and I just hope that we can provide you all with a couple hours of joy and entertainment,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After Karger announced that Mary J. Blige was “the first person to ever be nominated for acting and songwriting for the same movie in the same year,” the artist received a standing ovation from the audience. Blige described the utter shock of finding out she was nominated for two Oscars, one for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Florence in the Netflix film “Mudbound” and the other for her Best Original Song for her song “Mighty River.”</p>\n<p>Blige cited her New York upbringing and Southern roots in helping her role as the Mississippi-raised Florence flourish on screen. Blige’s portrayal of the matriarch is one that challenges prejudice and acts as a mission statement for the future. Blige said playing Florence served as a healing process. “It gave me a place to give all the heaviness that I felt trapped in, and let Florence have every single pain and every confusion,” she said.  Blige confidently confirmed that she will be singing “Mighty River” on the Oscars telecast, comparing this reality to a dream that she expects someone to pinch her out of.</p>\n<p>John Boyega’s role as Melvin Dismukes in “Detroit” created a platform from which to speak against the police brutality experienced by black men in the 1967 Detroit riots. Much like fellow Virtuosos award recipient Daniel Kaluuya’s performance in “Get Out,” Boyega and Kaluuya’s characters were portraits of racial tragedies and injustice. Boyega exuded the confidence of a seasoned actor as he charismatically waltzed onto the stage and gushed about being in Santa Barbara for the first time. Karger asked Boyega about the intricate performance he gave during an interrogation scene in “Detroit” where his character’s hands are trembling with insecurity and nervousness. Boyega recalled how meeting Melvin Dismukes affected his honest portrayal of a man who experienced a pivotal time in history: “A big thing was trying to get to know him separate from his circumstance in the movie.

The American actor, nominated for an Academy Award, was recognized at the SBIFF for his roles in ‘Call Me By Your Name’ and ‘Lady Bird.’ <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Chalamet handles Karger’s questions in a way similar to the quirky awkwardness of a character in a coming-of-age indie film. His reaction to Karger inquiring about the infamous peach scene in<em> “</em>Call Me By Your Name” was met with slight laughter, accompanied by the sarcastic, “I have been waiting for this moment my whole life!” Chalamet says he did three takes for the last scene of the film, where he is seated by a fireplace as Sufjan Stevens’s “Visions of Gideon” acts as a consoling backdrop to his crying. Luca Guadagnino has pondered about possibly making a sequel to “Call Me By Your Name,” and Chalamet says he will be on board with the project. “I mean yeah, that would mean employment,” he said.</p>\n<p>Clad in Gucci loafers, Daniel Kaluuya, stepped onto the stage, giving a shou-tout to three-time Academy Award nominee “Get Out” director Jordan Peele. Kaluuya states that Peele was hesitant to give the part of Chris to a British actor as he felt it was particular to an African-American storyline.</p>\n<p>“If you leave the M25 in Britain, it’s “Get Out.” I live this. He [Peele] uses African-American voice and perspective to tap into a universal black truth navigating a Western construct,” Kaluuya said. Kaluuya’s way of portraying Chris, a man who is plagued with confusion, denial and trauma amidst a falsely idyllic family was by “thinking with emotions and music.”</p>\n<p>“The Big Sick’s” Kumail Nanjiani had the audience in fits of laughter. He compared making “The Big Sick” to getting out the last bits of ketchup from out of a bottle. “It was like a bottle of old ketchup that you have to slap the back of,” he said. “And the congealed piece comes out, and finally the rest will come out. This movie was the congealed piece.” He spoke on co-writing the break-up scene that “The Big Sick’s” storyline revolves around with his wife, Emily V. Gordon: “It was interesting when I was writing the break-up scene and I thought I was making some great points, but when I got the rewrite, Emily was making some great points as well.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80889\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1753104709\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80885\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80889\" data-attachment-id=\"80889\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/mask-thomas-fire-by-sicheng-wang-online-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=2000%2C1330&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1330\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF by Dafan Huang\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80889\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80889\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Detroit’ star John Boyega at the 2018 Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Nanjiani also addressed the long-term effects of Gordon’s illness and beamed about how the happiness he felt for Gordon’s Oscar nomination superseded the happiness he felt over his: “The first thing I felt when we received the Oscar nomination was such pride in her. I was like ‘oh my god, the person I love most is nominated for an Academy Award.’ She fought through so much to be rewarded in this way. I’m just so proud of her.”</p>\n<p>The group discussion that followed was an amalgamation of Kaluuya doing an impression of Will Smith laughing on a talk show, Chalamet desperately trying to show everyone proof that Matthew McConaughey left a voicemail on his phone, Nanjiani humorously mocking Chalamet’s portrayal of C-3PO, Boyega revealing his love for K-pop and Blige voicing her desire to become the new Princess Leia.</p>\n<p>The recipients of the 2018 Virtuosos Award provided a fascinating unpredictability that had the audience on edge of their seats, ready to laugh and leaving them reluctant to leave the escape of a Hollywood party at the Arlington Theatre. This year’s group of Virtuosos provided a warm presence that made the audience feel like they were sharing a drink with friends — and it just so happens that these friends are Oscar nominees.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/","id":5810,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[5809,5808,5807],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Black Panther’ Leaps Its Way to the Top","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Ryan Coogler's  \"Black Panther\" is a film rooted in real-life issues that tells one of Marvel's more grounded stories while being set in an unabashedly sci-fi setting.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Panther” follows some recent creative trends on Marvel’s part while forging ahead with new ideas.

Barring Tom Hiddleston’s Loki, Marvel’s villains are either shallow characters or are downright forgettable. Ronan from “Guardians of the Galaxy” just wanted revenge. Killian (Guy Pearce in “Iron Man 3”) also just wanted revenge. As for Malekith, well, not only did I have to look up his name, but I also cannot remember a single thing he said or did in “Thor: The Dark World.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, when you boil it down, Killmonger’s objective is also just revenge. However, it’s revenge rooted in social circumstance. Growing up as a black child in Oakland, Calif. probably isn’t the most pleasant experience, especially after becoming an orphan. Killmonger did not grow up in an affluent, high-tech African nation; he had to struggle in one of America’s most crime-ridden cities and experience prejudice. And I love the fact that the movie doesn’t just say this outright; it’s something that’s heavily implicit. Killmonger’s pain leads him to become the very thing he hates, which makes him a fascinating, complex villain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Jordan can now safely say that he has escaped the stain on his filmography that is “Fantastic Four.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Killmonger’s partner Ulysses Klaue, a villain returning from</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Age of Ultron,” Andy Serkis seems like he’s having a helluva time playing such a hammy role without having to wear a mo-cap suit. But in the grand scheme of things, Klaue is a throwaway villain and the film spares no time in acknowledging this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the rest of the cast could not be considered throwaways, though. Boseman is back in top form as the Black Panther, King of Wakanda, superhero and sovereign ruler. He’s personable and fights for his country, but the figurative crown doesn’t require him to have a stick up his ass. His sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plays off of him well with her mischievous demeanor and intelligence. She is the film’s heart, as well as its greatest source of comedy (and nifty gadgets).</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81498\" style=\"width: 1191px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1537555068\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81498\" data-attachment-id=\"81498\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/blackpanther-original/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?fit=1181%2C1407&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1181,1407\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BlackPanther Original\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?fit=210%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?fit=860%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81498\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=888%2C1058\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1058\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?w=1181&amp;ssl=1 1181w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=210%2C250&amp;ssl=1 210w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=768%2C915&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPanther-Original.jpg?resize=860%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81498\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lily Garcia-Daly / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Danai Gurira of “Walking Dead” fame trades her katana in for a spear and her survival gear for an elaborate, awesome-looking red combat suit as the head of Wakanda’s royal guard. While she kicks the most ass, she’s also part of some ham-fisted drama between herself and her lover W’Kabi, played by Daniel Kaluuya (We know they’re lovers because she tells us they are). After playing such an interesting protagonist in “Get Out,” it’s a shame to see Kaluuya having to portray such a thinly written character who changes allegiances on a dime. Victim to exposition and some truly goofy scenes with CGI rhinos, he is the film’s greatest writing casualty, mostly existing to serve the plot rather than himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of the CGI, “Black Panther” is heavily reliant on it, for both good and ill. It would be pretty much impossible to depict Wakanda in its purple-tinged sci-fi tech glory otherwise, but then you have the final battle with the aforementioned CGI rhinos and a literal catfight between men in mo-cap suits. At that point it looks less like a battle and more like a violent Robert Zemeckis flick. There’s just something about CGI — when used to depict things you could otherwise depict practically — that kills immersion. You can’t have Black Panther fighting Killmonger on a mag-lev train track, of course, but can’t they at least be in actual suits? It’s the movie’s climax; it deserves the feeling of authenticity that had been fairly consistent up until that point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then again, a fight is only as good as the story behind it. It can be flashy, it can look badass, but if you don’t give a shit what’s happening with the characters then the fight is just that. “Black Panther,” besides being about a king fighting for what’s his, also delves into themes of responsibility. Wakanda has the technology and resources to enhance the lives of millions. But should it? T’Challa grapples with this question throughout the film, which drives his decisions and his interactions with his loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killmonger, however, thinks Wakanda ought to arm people of color to rise up against their oppressors. The film is very much interested in observing how people utilize power, both of the fictional superhuman variety and the political variant. In a world where we have politicians making increasingly stupid decisions all across the bloody planet, it’s certainly not something to quickly dismiss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we have a smart Marvel movie that’s not set in New York for once and has an awesome cast to play fascinating characters, a gorgeously rendered setting and an engrossing story that develops its characters well and leaves me excited to see them in a couple more months when “Infinity War” drops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only reason I could find not to see this movie is having to sit through several trailers for what look like progressively shittier movies. That, or you’re an astounding racist. In which case, sucks to be you.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung apologizes in advance if he offends anyone from Oakland. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/black-panther-leaps-its-way-to-the-top/","id":5811,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5810,5809,5808],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
