Fourth Friday: Feels Fest. Not only was the lovely event musically catered, but A.S. Program Board also made sure to offer an interactive graffiti wall for any aspiring Basquiats to showcase their talents. The sleek acoustic set by the opening act, Culver, felt like the equivalent of a warm cup of coffee for the chilly night. The smooth production of Shy Girls set the night a flare, the crowd graced with smiles at the romantic lyrics Dan Vidmar translated from his mind into the microphone.</p>\n<p>The precedent performer of the night Culver from Orange County somewhat outshined the main act by displaying his ability to sing a slew of cover songs at the drop of a hat. Culver brought the sparse crowd together and eradicated the awkward atmosphere that permeated the audience. The narrative of his set list dealt with heartbreaking scenarios and offered the audience a perspective into Culver’s mind. The intimacy between Culver and the 40 or so members of the audience was instinctively felt, as people sniffled, maybe due to the frigid weather or the solace they found in the sorrow radiating from his lyrics. Second-year biology major Chloe Anderson stated, “He [Culver] reminds me of an early Lewis Watson.”<br>\nA lengthy silence followed a round of applause after his third song of the night, in which Culver enthusiastically stated, “I’m gonna play yet another sad song!”<br>\nThe onslaught of emotional songs basked in honesty provided a deepened connection between the audience and Culver compared to how the night’s headliner, Shy Girls, decided to approach the crowd. Due to the late arrival of Shy Girls, Culver had to extend his set by 15 minutes, in which he played Norah Jones and Tracy Chapman covers to keep the crowd attentive.<br>\nHis rendition of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car” was halted as Culver respectively mentioned, “To be honest with you guys I can’t finish the song because, I genuinely forgot some of the lyrics. I don’t want anyone beating me up for messing up this song.”<br>\nThe land of Portland conjures up beloved mental images of singer-songwriter Elliot Smith, the infamous feminist bookstore sketch in “Portlandia” and cold brew. Yet, the lovely Pacific Northwest town is also the origin of Dan Vidmar, the face of electronic R&amp;B act Shy Girls. The performances of the night were split into two different factions, those of heartening ballads dealing with emotionally draining subject matter and those of entrancing dance melodies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76121\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"597923929\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76120\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76121\" data-attachment-id=\"76121\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/shy-girls-and-culver-provide-warmth-for-perfect-park/shy-girls-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1523&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1523\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"shy girls 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?fit=888%2C661&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76121\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2-250x186.jpg?resize=250%2C186\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"186\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C762&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shy-girls-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76121\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Shy Girls</p></div>\n<p>Shy Girls’ latest project, titled Salt, has Vidmar’s silky tenor radiating within refined percussion. The name “Shy Girls” might strike familiarity with the UCSB audience, as he lent his vocals to the previous Extravaganza headliner Odesza on the track “All We Need.” Vidmar’s R&amp;B falsettos can easily be collaborated with the likes of Daniel Caesar or BadBadNotGood to make a hit. The minimalism entrenched in Shy Girls’ sound only adds to the meticulously produced foggy ambiance.<br>\nVidmar took the stage and, with a breathy voice, coaxed the crowd to come closer so he could see their faces. With a Lorde-like hand motion, Vidmar from Shy Girls truly immersed himself in the essence of atmospheric music. Atmospheric music can often be labeled as rather “boring” and “dull” if you’re not on a substance-induced high. Despite this, Shy Girls had the entirety of the crowd moving to their eclectic sound in ways reminiscent of Taylor Swift’s infamous dances. Only accompanied by his guitar player, Vidmar’s vocals became increasingly intriguing, as the instrumentation highlighted his presence on stage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The multifaceted track “Watercolor Dreams” from Shy Girls’ album Salt pays homage to Vidmar’s teenage years spent listening to Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. Straying from the safety net of the synth, Vidmar experiments with guitar riffs and drums to intertwine rock elements with a song dedicated to painting the false facades of people in a relationship. The soulful edge brought by Vidmar’s guitar performance highlights the pop melodies of songs like “Say You Will” and elicited a perpetual sway throughout the crowd.</p>\n<p>Chiara Smith, a political science major, stated, “Besides the lack of people in attendance, all the performers put on great sets.”<br>\nShy Girls concluded the night with an abstract performance of their hit “Second Heartbreak,” leaving a magical numb feeling that resonated with the audience. Everyone walked home in a state of bliss from the live, soul-warming music they witnessed. If you ever need an escape from a house party playing the same top-40 rap hits, support A.S. Program Board’s First Fridays and witness outstanding artists at Perfect Park.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

artists that typically would not think to stop in the city. Thanks to the large capacity of the venue, SB is advancing on the charts as a concert city next to places like Los Angeles and San Diego and has even sparked the interest of arising hip hop legend G-Eazy. G-Eazy will be making a stop in Santa Barbara on the second leg of his “When It’s Dark Out” tour Tuesday, April 19 and, as per usual, will not make his exit without leaving his mark on the beautiful city.</p>\n<p>Young Gerald, aka G-Eazy, knew from the beginning that he was going to make it big, yet he remained humble and let other people find out for themselves just how good he is. His lyrics are often misinterpreted as being filled with the typical tangents of cockiness that rappers rant about in the midst of their fame; however, G-Eazy’s perception of himself and what he is capable of has remained constant throughout his music even as he evolves as an artist. When this is attributed to his character, it is easy to decode the messages in his music in a negative light and dislike him as a person. On the contrary, his love for his fans is monumental, and it is evident that he will not rest until he puts the Bay Area on the map. As well as repping the Bay, he is known for collaborating with a number of well-known artists like Mod Sun, Blackbear, Kehlani and Marc E. Bassy.</p>\n<p>Even with the restless back-to-back shows on his lengthy tours, G-Eazy found the time to open another leg of “When It’s Dark Out” shows after the release of the album. The album itself received an overwhelming amount of reviews from astounded critics on various social media outlets and music blogs. The first leg of the tour featured surprise guest appearances from artists like Chris Brown, YG, ASAP Ferg and Diddy, leading fans to describe his shows as something directly out of a movie. That being said, when G-Eazy books a show, he brings a show. Fans at the Santa Barbara Bowl will be in for a treat and will get to discover exactly what things happen when it’s dark out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/g-eazy-coming-to-sb-bowl/","id":6785,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6784,6783,6782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Maceo Parker Brings Legendary Funk to Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Maceo-Parker-1-by-Ines-Kaiser.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Maceo-Parker-1-by-Ines-Kaiser.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s own Campbell Hall hosted a performance by the legendary funk and soul jazz saxophonist Maceo Parker as a part of Arts & Lectures’ Roots Series","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p class=\"Normal1\">The dim room stirred in anticipation as nearly every seat was filled with eager bodies. The stage was brightly lit in hues of blues, red and violet. On Thursday night, UCSB’s own Campbell Hall hosted a performance by the legendary funk and soul jazz saxophonist Maceo Parker as a part of Arts &amp; Lectures’ Roots series. Parker is most known for his work alongside James Brown in the 1960s and with Parliament-Funkadelic in the ’70s. After going solo in the ’90s, he began playing alongside legends like Prince and De La Soul.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The crowd, composed of mainly older adults and a few college students, sat in the massive auditorium waiting for the first act to go on. The room was almost completely full and many were buzzing with excitement, creating a very high energy in the room.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Opening for Parker was The Jones Family Singers, a band made up of family members from Houston, Tex. Performing in the style of gospel blues and jazz, this was their Santa Barbara debut. They had amazing stage presence, directing the audience to stand up and dance along with them. Their large vocal range rang through the hall as their five vocalists filled the room with bluesy lyrics. The energy they brought to the stage was so powerful that many people stood up and jived along while clapping to the beat. One of the main vocalists then employed a call-response method, successfully engaging with the audience by transporting them back to the roots of gospel. The crowd was so high-energy and so responsive, one could feel more than just the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The screams of the crowd were almost deafening, drowning out the sounds of the announcer. The music started and the crowd went almost silent. The heavy bass and strong funky drum pattern complemented the smooth sounds of Parker’s saxophone. Add in the brass trombone, a guitar and a piano, and the blending of sounds brought you back to the funkadelic grooves of the 1970s. Parker’s music epitomizes what funk is; the rhythmic tune of the bass emphasized the down beat alongside the jazzy and soulful blues. The compilation of intricate sounds blended together so effortlessly, varying between slow jazz and a faster upbeat, funky tempo. One could hardly sit still. Many were shaking their heads, tapping their feet and swaying to the intense rhythm. At one point, many had gotten up out of their chairs to dance to the music. The entire set was accompanied by shouts of love and encouragement as well as constant clapping and whistles. The legend played well-known songs by other famous artists like Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx, Marvin Gaye and Ben E. King. Parker continually sang in his deep, throaty voice “We love you,” engaging with the audience while also showing his appreciation. He made small jokes here and there, really talking to his audience, confirming his ability to connect with the crowd. The response back to Parker was electric and almost tangible. The audience grooved to the tunes as the sharp guitar riffs and the blunt plucking sound of the bass echoed through the hall. The energy, almost as palpable as the music itself, rang through the ears of every person experiencing Parker’s talent. The show ended with a very long, rad drum solo, and Parker played the crowd out. Screams and claps reverberated through the large hall.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">UCSB alumnus Patricia Oreño said that this was a wonderful time. “As a child of the ’70s, I grew up with funk, and I’ve always been a fan. I had so much fun. I don’t come to these events as often as I should, but I’m glad I came to this one. I hope they have him back because I will be back for him.”</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-01/maceo-parker-brings-legendary-funk-to-campbell-hall/","id":6786,"author":{"id":737,"name":"Savanah Marshall"},"related":[6785,6784,6783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Get Groovy with Marc E.

Bassy is no stranger to the artistic scene that defines the West Coast. After working with artists like G-Eazy, Chris Brown, Wiz Khalifa and Kehlani, one might think that he would already be a household name. Instead, his inimitable talent is masked by our perception of what genre(s) music should be categorized into. However, it has yet to alter the outcome of the electric melodies he continues to make.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc E. Bassy has created a wave of sounds so soulful and complex, struck by his distinct vocals, that there is no putting a name to it. It is a form of complexity that his fans have come to accept, and an overwhelming form of beauty that the world of music may have yet to be ready for. Vulnerability is what keeps one human, and it is embodied in the sound that Marc E. Bassy has crafted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has performed on larger stages across the world, so it is fair to say that as he takes the stage of Velvet Jones, it will be an impressive experience for everyone in the room. It proves difficult to put a name to the energy that runs through his veins, or the soul that fuels his fire, but it only makes being in his presence even more rewarding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intimacy, accompanied by his heart of his sleeve, will flood the room full of emotions that will plague the body for some time to come. This show will not just be one to attend, but it will be one to feel.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74550\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/get-groovy-with-marc-e-bassy-at-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74550\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/get-groovy-with-marc-e-bassy-at-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/get-groovy-with-marc-e-bassy-at-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/get-groovy-with-marc-e-bassy-at-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/get-groovy-with-marc-e-bassy-at-velvet-jones/","id":6787,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6786,6785,6784],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
