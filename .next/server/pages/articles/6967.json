A momma’s boy his whole life, Johnson spent the flight to school from his hometown in Oahu crying tears of homesickness. Now that he was getting into the swing of things, the homesickness was subsiding a little, especially when he spotted a girl named Kim. Intense eye contact was made, so intense that she sat next to him. Kim was a math major gearing up to become a teacher. Tall with light brown eyes, she was a “girl next door” type from Texas. Jack was smitten.</p>\n<p>“I was a momma’s boy … and of course it took me just a week to find a new mom,” Johnson said to a hooting crowd at Corwin Pavilion Friday, April 24. “I mean, [she] did start washing my clothes for me.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to legendary UCSB alumni, no one fits the mold more than Jack Johnson. As the acoustic crooner who put De La Guerra Dining Commons on the map in the song “Bubble Toes,” — although the actual Jack and Kim meeting place was Ortega, DLG just rhymed better — Johnson is a seminal embodiment of this grand school we call home.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Seriously, when thinking of UCSB, it’s all green living, fit bodies, a lively music scene and 5 a.m. sessions at Sands. Jack surfs the swell, croons, keeps in shape and is so environmentally conscious that disposable cutlery is banned from his tours. There’s not one Gaucho who epitomizes Santa Barbara’s quintessential attributes better.</p>\n<p>But there is one thing that keeps Jack away from the classification of the average Gaucho: He’s not a hit-it-and-quit-it kind of guy. It’s no secret that the voraciously social scene of UCSB creates a hookup culture where one night stands are the norm. In this carnal college town, a steady, stable relationship is nearly unheard of. A relationship in I.V. is almost as fabled as Jim Morrison’s time spent here in the ’60s when he wrote “Crystal Ship” after Platform Holly.</p>\n<p>And then Jack and Kim Johnson show up for Alumni Weekend, and the two expel such extensive bouts of cuteness that people believe in true love again. The pair returned to Santa Barbara to receive the UCSB Distinguished Alumni Award for their sustainability and green initiatives within the Hawaiian education system and the music industry. The award fit suitably with UCSB’s newest accolade as the greenest public university in America.</p>\n<p>In their trip to campus, the Johnsons planted citrus trees at Storke plaza, hung out with Chancellor Yang and his wife, Dilling, and stopped by some of their old stomping grounds in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We went to I.V. today and saw our niece’s apartment, which happens to be our friend’s apartment 15, 20 years ago,” Kim said. “I.V. hasn’t changed that much. I think it’s the same carpet.”</p>\n<p>As part of the event, Jack and Kim showed a documentary of their green initiatives with the All At Once campaign, a tour that combined concerts with plastic-free, local food education. The documentary was followed by a Q&amp;A that dished out details from the couple’s way too adorable college lives.</p>\n<p>The song “Do You Remember” chronicles snippets of the young love, mentioning a house with a big piano, a treehouse built on campus that burned down and a bike getting locked to another.</p>\n<p>“He really did lock his bike to my bike, outside of I.V. Theater,” Kim said. “We had already met in the dining commons but we didn’t really see each other after that. So I walked out of my class a week later, and someone locked their bike to my bike and I thought ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t go to lunch right now.’”</p>\n<p>But the story gets better than that. “He [was] hiding in the bushes. He likes to think he’s off to the side being super cool, smoking a cigarette, but really he was hiding. Then he said, ‘Hey, wanna go get lunch?’” Kim said, grinning.</p>\n<p>Following their freshmen year, Jack and Kim ended up living across the street from each other at the end of Sueno, and again on the 66 block of Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“Then we moved to Trigo — we had a little space with a garden, and that was the first space we gardened,” Jack said.</p>\n<p>Growing up, Jack was only able to sing in front of his mom due to a nervous restrictor he had. Soon enough, he was able to sing in front of Kim, who showed him records by Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin and the Pixies.</p>\n<p>“Kim had already read all of Jack Kerouac and the Beatnik stuff, and I was just getting into that,” the 39-year-old singer said. “She had better taste than me … She’s always been my co-writer [for songs], except the love songs. I don’t let her see those until they’re done.” According to Kim, most of the love songs are written on a whim when Jack forgets a birthday or an anniversary. “Angel” was written one Christmas.</p>\n<p>While dating his college sweetheart and pursuing his film and media studies degree — Jack was keen to make surf documentaries — the soon-to-be professional singer had a DP party band called Soil which formed out of the Anacapa Residence Hall. Soil’s rival band was Django Reinhardt, a group formed by pianist Zach Gill who now plays in Johnson’s band. The two bands would fight it out to get more people to come to their shows, whether it was at a house party or at the Hub.</p>\n<p>“If we heard Django was playing a house party the same night we did, we had to get another keg. So we’d always have two kegs,” Jack said.</p>\n<p>Post-college, Kim got her master’s in teaching at UCSB and started at Dos Pueblos High School. Jack did video production gigs, made surf movies and shot music videos for the Foo Fighters and Limp Bizkit. He wrote the soundtrack to the surf cult hit “Thicker Than Water.” This was the big break in his singing-songwriting career and caused Ben Harper to invite Jack to perform alongside him in 2001. That same year, the Hawaiian native released his first album, <em>Brushfire Fairytales</em>, which went platinum in the States and reached number one in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>But a year before Jack blew up on the radio, his best day ever was spent getting married to his college sweetheart, barefoot and on the beach.</p>\n<p>Upon receiving the Distinguished Alumni Award, Jack repeated how wonderful it was to get an award as a couple.</p>\n<p>“To me this is the biggest honor, that they recognize us both … then I look back at our tours and I see the evolution, where we got to while working with non-profit groups, I’m really proud of where we’ve gotten. And Kim is more than 50 percent of that.”</p>\n<p>Jack and Kim Johnson’s relationship is the ultimate partnership — a love story in this seemingly hapless beach town. It’s always better when they’re together.</p>\n<p>To find out more about Jack and Kim Johnson’s green initiatives, go to <em><a href=\"http://allatonce.org/\">allatonce.org</a></em><em>.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/its-better-when-theyre-together-kim-and-jack-johnson-share-ucsb-stories/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/its-better-when-theyre-together-kim-and-jack-johnson-share-ucsb-stories/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/its-better-when-theyre-together-kim-and-jack-johnson-share-ucsb-stories/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/its-better-when-theyre-together-kim-and-jack-johnson-share-ucsb-stories/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/its-better-when-theyre-together-kim-and-jack-johnson-share-ucsb-stories/","id":6967,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[6966,6965,6964],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder","biography":"Not available","articles":[3441,5909,5937,5968,6036,6940,6967,6970,6976,7003,7029,7069,7089,7090,7602,7603,7634,7635,7759],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"JMSN To Perform at Blind Tiger","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Somewhere in the labyrinthine tangle of apartments that comprise North Hollywood, Christian Berishaj tinkers away in his dark home studio preparing for his next release.

Berishaj is part of a line of dark and euphoric R&amp;B singers who are begrudgingly dragged into the daylight, a trend that started with Frank Ocean and the Weeknd. His music betrays his reclusive nature.</p>\n<p>In 2007, already receiving mild success in a band titled Love Arcade, Berishaj made a decision that many breaking artists would condemn as a fatal blow to the career of an aspiring musician. He abandoned his post at Atlantic Records. However, he left out of claustrophobia rather than pride.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I work better in isolation when no one’s judging me,” Berishaj said.</p>\n<p>His clairvoyance has paid off. Since founding White Room Records in 2012, he sang uncredited vocals for Kendrick Lamar, produced for Ab-Soul and Tyga, got remixed by Ta-Ku and collaborated with Kaytranada. Besides partnering with industry powerhouses, the industrious self-taught singer-songwriter-producer has released two full-length studio albums and three EPs since 2012. So who is the man receiving recognition from the most important tastemakers in the industry?</p>\n<p>Berishaj is an unlikely suspect to be gaining attention, to say the least. His stage name is JMSN, a homage to his favorite liquor. He looks akin to a skinnier, urban-styled Chet Faker due to his Jesus haircut and affinity for black and white hues. Despite his unapologetically minimalistic appearance, the singer hits the highest of sopranos in ballads of dumped girlfriends and hustled Detroit currency.</p>\n<p>Berishaj produces all of his own tracks. “I had to learn out of necessity,” the vocalist said. He cites White Stripes and J Dilla as his primary Detroit influences, but his production bears no resemblance. The beats contain a deep self-loathing that is as discomforting as it is seductive. The music invites repressed memories to the surface forcefully, in an almost cathartic manner.</p>\n<p>His fans attest to this. JMSN fans are more cult than music following. His performances resemble some splice between an angry punk show and full-band hip-hop. Frequently, live performances end in the lanky Detroiter being bounced on the hands of his worshippers.</p>\n<p>Fans that have been listening to JMSN since the debut of <em>Priscilla</em> will note that the star’s music still possesses the grunge factor that created the initial allure, but now has a dancy-er component. So if you like grungy euphoric beats (think Clams Casino – “Palace”) and the Weeknd’s lusciously dark vulnerability, then venture to the Blind Tiger this Friday to catch recluse genius JMSN.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62789\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"954553354\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62788\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62789\" data-attachment-id=\"62789\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/jmsn-solitary-genius-to-grace-the-bling-tiger/jmsn_photo_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?fit=1800%2C1215&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1215\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"JMSN_Photo_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?fit=888%2C599&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62789\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?resize=600%2C405\" alt=\"Courtesy of Sebastian Maldonado\" width=\"600\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JMSN_Photo_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C691&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62789\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>Sebastian Maldonado</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As remixes to Amerie’s hit “1 Thing” and Erykah Badu’s “On and On” played in the background, the audience talked anxiously amongst themselves. Although impatient grunts and sighs came prior to the show, Tijoux and her opener, Alas, did not disappoint. They proved women can rock the mic just like the men – if not better.</p>\n<p>A woman of Hispanic origin, Alas rapped about the issues affecting her people and other oppressed persons of color. Dressed in vans, jeans and a plain shirt, Alas’s laidback appearance demonstrated that she possesses zero interest in gimmicks and means business. Alas began the set with powerful, raspy vocals reminiscent of Lorde. With no beats coming from the speakers, she created her own beat with an occasional stomp or clapping.</p>\n<p>The instant the beat dropped, her rhymes sped up, quick and of high quality. The crowd cheered as she rapped “propaganda almost had me convinced I’m worthless” and “we ain’t even mad we’re too busy getting even.” Alas won the crowd over with unfiltered lyrics about colonization, oppression and empowering native peoples.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Alas provided context to each song before performing it. Before performing her song “KKED,” she acknowledged the current and future victims of police brutality – particularly those who do not and will not gain media attention. “KKED” generated the biggest reaction from the audience, with raw lyrics like “you can’t flash enough badges to get my respect.” Due to her political and social consciousness, Alas earned raised fists, approving yells and bobbing heads throughout her set, making her the perfect opener for Tijoux.</p>\n<p>Star of the night Ana Tijoux came and put the icing on the cake. The daughter of Chilean political exiles, Tijoux’s lyrics discuss her upbringing and the conditions of oppressed people. The second Tijoux was visible to the crowd, “Ana” chants began. She graced the stage with a youthful look in a Camouflage jacket, high-top Converse, hoop earrings and a side braid.</p>\n<p>The French-Chilean rapper wasted no time and jumped right into her set. A fast-paced Spanish flow, drums, electric guitars and changing voices amplified the stage and gave old school vibes. Clearly, Tijoux is not an artist of one sound. Her tunes were a mixture of 1960s funk, ’90s R&amp;B, traditional Chilean sounds and hardcore rap. The variations in the beat aligned with the winking, pointing and hip-winding she engaged in throughout the night. The emcee powerhouse did not depend on her lyrics alone to convey meaning; Tijoux’s voice inflections and furrowed eyebrows added emphasis to her content.</p>\n<p>The crowd fed off of the rapper’s excited energy throughout the entire night. Tijoux kept the audience engaged as she initiated clapping, pounded her chest and asked the audience to “make some noise.” The song “Vengo,” where she discusses relearning the world and her ancestors, had the crowd going nuts early in her set. The passion was especially evident in “Vengo” as she squinted, tapped her temple and quickly moved her hands with the speedy beat. The audience matched the intensity as they shouted the lyrics.</p>\n<p>“Todo Lo Sólido Se Desvanece En El Aire” produced a similar reaction. In the song, Tijoux questions what the world would be like without the corrupt institutions of modern-day. Audience member Idalia confessed her love for Tijoux roots in the fact that “she’s one of the few women of color who talks about stuff that actually matters.” Tijoux’s ability to make a crowd dance while simultaneously sharing politically and socially relevant issues demonstrates why she is nothing short of a badass (and her occasional smirks suggested she is aware of it).</p>\n<p>At the end of the night, the <em>Daily</em> <em>Nexus</em> was able to chat with the opener, Alas. Alas revealed that Tijoux is somebody she looks up to. “[Ana is] someone of indigenous descent who has a voice of empowerment,” Alas said.</p>\n<p>The two ladies demonstrate how music can have meaning while still being fun and danceable. To hear more from the female powerhouses, Alas can be found on SoundCloud under “alasmusika” and Ana Tijoux can be found on iTunes with her 2014 album, <em>Vengo.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62844\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ana-Tijoux_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"970066205\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62880\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62844\" data-attachment-id=\"62844\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/french-chilean-rapper-ana-tijoux-challenges-the-oppressor-at-the-hub/ana-tijoux-gained-worldwide-recognition-with-the-release-of-her-album-1977/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ana-Tijoux_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,338\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Ana Tijoux gained worldwide recognition with the release of her album 1977\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429864177\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"32\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Ana Tijoux gained worldwide recognition with the release of her album 1977\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ana Tijoux\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ana-Tijoux_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ana-Tijoux_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62844\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ana-Tijoux_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ana-Tijoux_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ana-Tijoux_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephen Manga</em>/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;

Berishaj sported basketball shorts, worn skate shoes that likely bore holes in the bottom and a baggy, white crewneck tee that hung far below the waist of his wiry figure. His hair was shagged to his shoulders on each side, ending just below at the back. A few white teeth gritted through the performer’s notably hedgy beard.</p>\n<p>JMSN stepped onstage accompanied by a three-piece band comprised of a bassist, drummer and keyboardist. A lone red Stratocaster sat in a stand, seemingly for show.</p>\n<p>“How y’all doing, Santa Barbara?” Berishaj asked as commencement for his first Blind Tiger show. A yell and a little bit of chatter was the only response. The crowd of 50-or-less seemed unsure of what to expect and perhaps a little uneasy about the singer’s unconventional dress. The headlining act even seemed a little unsure of himself.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I don’t really know his music, but my friend said he’s pretty good,” Jaime Woodfin said, a Blind Tiger first-timer.</p>\n<p>Judging by the lack of crowd response, it appeared as if the concertgoers came to the Blind Tiger to see a show without really expecting to see <em>this</em> show. As if on cue, the speakers filled the room with the infectious melody of “Addicted,” a powerfully, catchy and dark hit off JMSN’s latest album.</p>\n<p>Upon grasping the microphone, the performer’s shoulder blades pinched backwards. Berishaj instantly shed any sign of vulnerability. Any self-doubt that may have been present before was no longer visible. His thin legs jangled into a two-step groove.</p>\n<p>The song concluded with a warm round of applause and many more cheers than that which followed JMSN’s stage entrance.</p>\n<p>“He dresses like a skater, so I didn’t really know what to expect,” Allison Locata said, another concert-goer. “He’s really good, though. He sings way better than a skater.”</p>\n<p>This sentiment seemed to be a popular consensus conveyed by the slow nods and enthused claps of the once skeptical audience members.</p>\n<p>Berishaj offered a diverse set, opting to select unexpected tracks from his catalogue, beginning with his debut album up until his most current release. His versatility on stage made it seem natural that members from the Top Dawg Ent. and Future Classic rosters revere this self-taught singer/producer virtuoso. Halfway through the set, it became apparent that the red Strat was not just for show. Every few songs he would pick up the lonely guitar to play rhythm to accompany his vocals.</p>\n<p>Each song — which all seemed to be about either a breakup or a party lasting until dawn — was accompanied by humble and endearing expression of thanks to the crowd from the songwriter. Hits like “Girl I Used to Know” or “Ends (Money)” drew very warm crowd receptions.</p>\n<p>After each number, Berishaj gained an increased vigor that didn’t have a cap until about 11:30 p.m. The elated musician said one last “thank you,” and exited the stage in a stupor. The crowd erupted in cheers. There was a distinct adoration that was not present at the beginning of the hour-long set.</p>\n<p>Christian Berishaj may appear to be an unlikely book for the Friday night slot, but that’s part of his charm. He excels as an artist and is exceedingly authentic. Throughout the performance, nothing topped his genuine demeanor. So on Friday night, 50-ish Santa Barbara locals were rewarded for taking a chance on an urban Jesus lookalike.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"JMSN - Street Sweeper by JMSN\" width=\"888\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F170875733&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=888&amp;maxheight=1000&amp;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/jmsn-strikes-a-chord-at-blind-tiger-shaggy-rb-vocalist-wins-audience-with-unexpected-relatibility/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/jmsn-strikes-a-chord-at-blind-tiger-shaggy-rb-vocalist-wins-audience-with-unexpected-relatibility/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/jmsn-strikes-a-chord-at-blind-tiger-shaggy-rb-vocalist-wins-audience-with-unexpected-relatibility/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/jmsn-strikes-a-chord-at-blind-tiger-shaggy-rb-vocalist-wins-audience-with-unexpected-relatibility/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/jmsn-strikes-a-chord-at-blind-tiger-shaggy-rb-vocalist-wins-audience-with-unexpected-relatibility/","id":6966,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[6965,6964,6963],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
