","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Pats O-Line vs. Falcons D-Line by Daniel Rubalcava</strong></p>\n<p>This week proves to be a big one as the Atlanta Falcons face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51 this Sunday, Feb. 3, at 3:30 p.m. in Houston, Texas. A primetime matchup that often gets overlooked is set to happen in the trenches themselves, primarily revolving around the Falcons defensive line vs. the Patriots offensive line.</p>\n<p>Although not much credit is given regarding their offensive line, the Patriots have been much improved this season after an atrocious 2015-16 season. Much of this credit should be given to offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who has really turned this group around. Left tackle Nate Solder holds the fort down for QB Tom Brady, while Marcus Cannon solidifies the run game on the right side. Joe Thuney, David Andrews and Shaq Mason shore up the middle of the 10th best O-Line in the NFL via <em>Profootballfocus.com</em>.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although the Pats rank seventh among postseason teams in rushing with a modest 2.9 yards per rush, they rank second in passing with an average of 326.5 yards per game. These averages are the outcome of a sturdy offensive line that is healthy. For any quarterback, being provided time in the pocket is key, but it becomes even more advantageous for a quarterback such as Brady, who they protected well with the fifth best ranking in sacks allowed at 24.</p>\n<p>Opposite the line of scrimmage is the Atlanta Falcons, who are an elusive and strong front. This is despite the fact that they rank sixth and seventh in rush and pass defense, respectively, during the playoffs; the Falcons are giving up 5.3 yards per rush to opposing teams, but only 6.8 yards per pass.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in an average of 20.5 points allowed per game; however, Vic Beasley Jr., Jonathan Babineaux, Tyson Jackson, Dwight Freeney and Co. are going to try and limit Brady and the Patriots. They have achieved their average the past two games, but the Patriots’ offense is explosive, and this D-Line may have to battle in a game that could possibly lead to a shootout.</p>\n<p>But don’t count the Falcons out just yet. All eyes will be on Beasley Jr. after he ended the season with a league-leading 15.5 sacks.</p>\n<p>Super Bowl 51 is set to be a great one, with anticipation of a high scoring, offensively charged game that could get out of hand on the scoreboard. The matchup seems sized up to be a battle in the trenches, and it could be a result of which line is willing to push a little harder to obtain the coveted Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Defense by Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>An old mantra of the NFL has been that “defense wins championships.” That hypothesis can both be supported in this year’s Super Bowl by the Patriots, who concluded the regular season with 5,223 yards allowed, the eighth fewest in the league.</p>\n<p>Yet it can be somewhat rejected, as the team graded out as subpar, finishing 16th in Football Outsiders’ defensive DVOA, known as Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, is a stat that measures the overall efficiency of the defense compared to league average.</p>\n<p>Atlanta is no greater on defense either, finishing the regular season ranked 27th in defensive DVOA, with the 25th defense according to total yards allowed (5,939). The unit has been playing well of late though, giving up 21 and 20 points in their first two playoff games against the Seahawks and Packers, respectively, both of which are teams with high offensive ceilings.</p>\n<p>Vic Beasley Jr. was a monster for the team all year, leading the league with 15.5 sacks. Although he’s yet to notch one in the playoffs thus far, the Falcons have sacked the quarterback five times in the past two games, suggesting Tom Brady will be under pressure all evening.</p>\n<p>In Brady’s two Super Bowl losses, a vicious opposing pass rush has been a common element and figures to be an essential factor in determining Sunday’s outcome.</p>\n<p>Atlanta has shown a penchant for creating chaos this postseason, amassing three interceptions, a forced fumble and a safety. New England has created five turnovers itself during the 2017 playoffs and will need to turn Matt Ryan over once or twice to have a shot at stopping this high-powered Falcons offense.</p>\n<p>The main playmakers in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, wide receiver Julio Jones, quarterback Matt Ryan and the backfield duo of Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman should be eager for a Patriots matchup that could work to their advantage.</p>\n<p>While New England allowed more than 20 points in only three games this regular season, it ranks 20th in defensive DVOA versus both number one receivers and running backs.</p>\n<p>But New England has put together a cohesive group on the defensive side of the ball, though the Patriots are bereft of the defensive superstars that have been a key component in each of Bill Belichick’s Super Bowl winning runs.</p>\n<p>No longer are the Pats depending on impact players such as Chandler Jones and Darrelle Revis from two years ago, who have been replaced by Chris Long and Logan Ryan, and it’s yet to be seen if this group can match up with a team as talented as the Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>I’ll take Brady, though, who has only thrown two interceptions on the year and seems pretty intent on sticking it to Roger Goodell and co.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Backfield by Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>Although it will be only the Falcons’ second ever Super Bowl appearance compared to the Patriots’ record-high 10th, Sunday’s matchup could be thrilling, especially when looking at the Falcons backfield going against the Patriots defense.</p>\n<p>Ranked No. 3 in the NFL when defending against the run, opposing teams only complete 88.6 rushing yards per game on average, making evident the cohesiveness and ability of the Pats’ defensive line. New England has only allowed five rushing touchdowns in 18 games this season, including playoffs, while not allowing a single running back to rush for over 100 yards in a single game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the field, the Atlanta Falcons backfield is No. 4 in the league, averaging 4.6 yards per run. They have managed to score 20 touchdowns off running plays during the regular season but will be challenged by the Patriots’ strong rushing defense.</p>\n<p>Propelling the Falcons’ offense are two particularly strong running backs in Tevin Coleman and Devonta Freeman. Twenty-three-year-old Coleman totaled 520 rushing yards in the regular season, scoring eight rushing touchdowns, averaging 4.4 yards per run and has not slowed his roll since season has ended. Coleman is also a huge threat out of the backfield as receiver where he totaled 421 yards on 31 receptions and added three more touchdowns.</p>\n<p>On 28 total touches this postseason, the Indiana alum has registered 143 total yards (86 yards rushing, 57 receiving) and two touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Teammate Freeman made it past the 1,000-yard mark for the second straight season rushing for a career-high 1,079 yards this year while, adding 11 rushing touchdowns. Like Coleman, Freeman also does a great job as a receiver as he totaled 54 receptions in the regular season for 462 yards and two touchdowns. In two games this season, Freeman rushed for over 100 yards and in both, the Falcons won by an average margin of 20.5 points. In his two postseason games, Freeman has totaled 207 total yards and two touchdowns on 36 touches.</p>\n<p>With experience as well as energy on their side, the Patriots present a strong front that could help lead the team to victory if their defensive ends can cover the outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Offense vs. Falcons Offense by Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>Super Bowl LI has potential to be an offensive clash for the ages, as the Falcons and Patriots, arguably the two best offenses in the NFL, flex their muscles on the biggest stage. Beyond the most notable matchup between perennial champion Tom Brady and veteran Matt Ryan — who has taken his game to a whole new level this season — throwing for a career high 38 TDs, both teams boast a countless number of threats that could make for a memorable game.</p>\n<p>If the defenses show up on their top game as expected, though, the running game will be key in deciding which team controls the tempo. Patriots RB LeGarrette Blount has been having a Super Bowl-worthy season, with 18 regular season TDs, adding one more in his team’s AFC Championship victory over the Steelers.</p>\n<p>His counterpart is no slouch either, as Falcons RB Devonta Freeman enters the title bout with 11 rushing TDs in the regular season while eclipsing 1,000 yards for the second straight season.<br>\nAtlanta heads into the big game with a slight edge in nearly every offensive category, with 295.3 yards in the air per game compared to New England’s 269.3 and 38 passing scores to 32.</p>\n<p>On the ground, the Falcons keep their advantage from their three-pronged running game with 120.5 yards per game and 20 TDs to the Patriots’ 117.0 YPG and 19 TDs.</p>\n<p>The Patriots’ biggest strength lies in their two main receiving targets for Brady, Julian Edelman and Martellus Bennett, who have combined for 1,800 receiving yards and 10 TDs this year, while the former was targeted 158 times, more than twice any other teammate. Matt Ryan’s number one target, Julio Jones, has had years to develop a relationship with his quarterback and the benefits this season were remarkable; Jones gathered over 1,400 receiving yards and seven TDs, averaging just over 100 YPG.</p>\n<p>Both teams have playmakers at every key offensive position and both offensive lines give the quarterbacks enough time to control the game, so the spotlight will obviously be on the two star QBs; that being said, it’ll be up to one of the skill players to come up with a game-winning play in the end.</p><div

night in which LeBron James sat out the second game of a back-to-back trip, the Cleveland Cavaliers remain the best team in the NBA thus far.</p>\n<p>The mission to “Defend the Land” has been placed

Most notably, they have defeated two of the East’s projected top contenders: the Toronto Raptors (twice this season) and the Boston Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its first defeat, the Cavs’ 6-0 start stands as the best team start in LeBron James’s career, having reached the 5-1 mark a total of three times in two consecutive seasons with Miami in 2012 and 2013 in addition to last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>\n<p>The end result of each season that started 5-1? Three NBA championship titles.</p>\n<p>It was the second-best start in franchise history, falling short of the 1976-77 Cavaliers’ 8-0 start.</p>\n<p>Although records don’t tell all about a team, Cleveland’s current squad could be the best team that has ever surrounded James, who is currently in his 10th season with the franchise since returning in 2014.</p>\n<p>Despite still being in his prime, at 31 years old James faces the reality of father time creeping up, considering the retirements of basketball legends Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett this past season and offseason.</p>\n<p>Although the King’s dethronement isn’t expected anytime soon, having recently surpassed NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon for 10th place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, the Cavaliers’ hometown superstar has about four to six years remaining in his career.</p>\n<p>It is a time span that reinforces the same message since his return to Cleveland: Win now.</p>\n<p>No one can predict what the Cavaliers will become post-LeBron, especially after the additions made in recent years, but it is likely the team will lose its value as a top contender. The immediate decline in wins from 2010-2014, occurring during James’s stint with the Heat, was more than enough evidence that it must build around their star player.</p>\n<p>The first step toward rebuilding during those four seasons was the selection of Kyrie Irving with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA with a foot injury and offset by other nagging injuries throughout his career, the most significant being his fractured kneecap in game one of the 2015 NBA Finals, Irving slightly became a forgotten cause as a player with the potential to be one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>Despite Irving earning the 2011-12 Rookie of the Year award and being known for his ability to score, a lack of acknowledgment for his game still remained.</p>\n<p>After LeBron James signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension during the 2014 offseason, his unexpected return that same year has worked in the favor of Irving ever since.</p>\n<p>Playing in just 53 games last season after recovering from the previous year’s knee injury, Irving has excelled, proving his ability to take over on the game’s biggest stage in the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Convincing many that he outplayed the two-time NBA MVP Steph Curry in the series, averaging 27.1 points per game and scoring the game-winning three-point dagger in his face to secure Cleveland’s first-ever title, Irving used the postseason to remind and prove to the world he is one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>It was obvious then, and it is obvious now that without Irving the Cavaliers cannot win an NBA championship.</p>\n<p>Whenever it seems like the Cavs are down and out on the brink of defeat, it is Irving who has stepped up as the team’s savior when even James wouldn’t be expected to prevail.</p>\n<p>Although other players such as J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Kevin Love and more play pivotal roles in the Cavs’ success as well, the tandem of Irving and James has formulated a one-two punch that is capable of carrying Cleveland to future title victories.</p>\n<p>The pairing of the two has helped reduce the pressures on James and provides Cleveland with an option to stay within winning games as the team’s leader rests.<br>\nFor purposes of rest, James intentionally sat out for the first time this season in the Cavs’ game against the Pacers.</p>\n<p>In addition to scoring the ball well, ranking third in the league in scoring at 109 PPG, Cleveland has remained consistent on defense, allowing 103.5 PPG. Despite the average, the Cavs have allowed 100-plus points in just six of their 11 games this season.</p>\n<p>Although the Golden State Warriors, considered Cleveland’s rival as we anticipate a third-consecutive Finals meeting between the two, are a team capable of going back and forth in a shootout with any team, their occasional lapses on defense detract from their league-leading 117.3 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Warriors are tied for allowing the seventh highest opponent PPG average at 109.3. In comparison to Cleveland’s six games, Golden State has allowed 100-plus points in nine of its 11 games.</p>\n<p>It is true the Warriors are still adjusting to their addition of former NBA MVP Kevin Durant and the departures of primary role players Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut, but Golden State must find a way to resolve its inconsistencies, which mainly fall on it becoming smaller around the key and paint areas.</p>\n<p>One can only hope another Cavs-Warriors championship matchup will take place. After leading in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks in the NBA Finals, if James and co. were able to defeat the self-embraced “Super Villains” of Golden State, he would achieve the ultimate victory that would earn him a nod in surpassing two of the game’s greatest in Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Much is still to occur throughout this season. There will be phases during which Cleveland will look like the best team or falter to its high expectations, preventing the prediction of the Cavs winning it all in 2016-17.</p>\n<p>It’s a game-by-game process in which teams continue to develop, even in the case of the Cleveland Cavaliers heading into year three of James being back at the helm. Their “All In” mentality is a motto that persists in the championship-or-bust expectations that have become standard for fans such as ourselves to judge accordingly.</p>\n<p>All stats are accurate as of Nov. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/","id":3338,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3337,3336,3335],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Checketts’ Method: A Winning Culture Reborn","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Since his arrival in 2011 and his coaching debut in 2012, Head Coach Andrew Checketts has brought a winning culture back to UCSB baseball.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71112\" style=\"width: 327px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71112\" data-attachment-id=\"71112\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/checketts-method-a-winning-culture-reborn/christinademarzo_andrewcheckettsbaseball_5-14-16_2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71112\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_AndrewCheckettsBaseball_5-14-16_2-web.jpg?resize=317%2C479\" alt=\"Head Coach Andrew Checketts has changed the culture of Gauchos Baseball.

The reason is simple: athletes don’t want to go play at a university where they won’t be competing for championships and garnering the exposure needed to reach the pro level.</p>\n<p>To turn around a program requires effort, dedication, money, but most importantly, it requires instilling a culture. Usually a program needs to instill a new culture to bring back a sense of attitude, and a new fire to show recruits that this will become a winning program.</p>\n<p>The UCSB baseball program is something that definitely needed a culture change back in 2011 when it was looking for a new head coach after the departure of Bob Brontsema who is still at UCSB, now serving as the assistant athletic director.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brontsema was a great coach as he attained the most wins in school history (483) after an illustrious 18-year career in which he also finished with the third best winning percentage (.503) in school history.</p>\n<p>Although Brontsema was a solid coach during his tenure, it was clear that after a 10-year hiatus from reaching a NCAA regional and not having won a Big West championship during his run, it was time for a change.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, a young, eager assistant coach awaited his coaching opportunity located in Oregon.

At first I thought it was too good to be true so I sent it to voicemail, but when I check it later that day it was the AD [athletic director] asking me if I was interested and, of course, I was.”</p>\n<p>On June 22, 2011, UCSB announced that Andrew Checketts would become the ninth head coach in program history.</p>\n<p>Checketts knew the expectations of UCSB’s program and was more than ready to bring a new culture to the university’s ball club — something he has definitely instilled in the short five years he has been here.</p>\n<p>In his first season as the baseball coach, Checketts had 16 seniors on his squad to help make his transition a bit easier and managed to hire the right assistant coaches in play.</p>\n<p>“I knew the first thing any good head coach needs is a great staff, so the first person I got was [Eddie} Cornejo and he has been great,” Checketts said. “We assembled the best staff we could and quickly started trying to figure out what we wanted and how we wanted it done.”</p>\n<p>During his first campaign, the former Oregon State High School Player of the Year impressed everyone as he had the most wins by a first-year head coach in school history with 28. Checketts, who also serves as the teams pitching coach, had a historic throwing rotation that combined for a program best 451 strikeouts on the season.</p>\n<p>Although it was yet another year, the Gauchos did not go to an NCAA regional; everyone knew that the future looked bright. However, Checketts knew that the future would only be bright if he brought in a great group of recruits.</p>\n<p>Although money might have been tight at times, Checketts saw the potential UCSB had to offer young student athletes and began working his recruiting magic right away. In 2012, Checketts held the 18th best recruiting class — the best in school history to this day — 39th in 2013 and 32nd in 2014 all according to <em>Perfect Game</em>.</p>\n<p>“I think kids want to come to UCSB,” Checketts said. “It has unbelievable academics, great baseball weather and amazing location. I think this is one of the best places to go to school on the earth so it makes my job easier.”</p>\n<p>Since that first year in 2012, every year has been an improvement for the UCSB baseball team. The following year in 2013, the Gauchos broke their postseason curse and reached their first NCAA regional for the first time in 12 years, ending its last 22 games with a 16-6 record along with winning six consecutive series to enter the postseason with a 35-25 record.</p>\n<p>In 2014, although Santa Barbara did not make a regional, it posted more than 30 wins for the second straight season, making Checketts just the second head coach in program history to have back-to-back 30-plus win seasons.</p>\n<p>Finally, last year the team achieved a landmark milestone as the impact of the 2012 and 2013 recruiting classes reached their peak, and the Gauchos had arguably the best season in school history after going 40-17-1 to set a new record in most wins against a D1 schools. That season, Santa Barbara was selected to host the South region as the No. 1 seed in the 2015 NCAA Regionals for the first time in program history.</p>\n<p>Although it did not make it out of the first round last year, there is no doubt that the UCSB baseball team has the most significant piece it needs to eventually make a run at the College World Series: A head coach.</p>\n<p>Since his arrival in 2011, Checketts has made significant impact as the programs winning percentage has gone from .500 to .702. He has also played a major role in the pitching department as the programs’ career ERA has made a significant drop from 4.14 in 2012 to 2.45 in 2015.</p>\n<p>Checketts 137-87-1 overall record during his first four full years of coaching currently places him as the Gauchos’ leader in career overall winning percentage (.612) and career conference winning percentage (.556).</p>\n<p>This season the UCSB baseball team is still making noise as it again already registered more than 30 wins on the season and enjoyed the success of breaking a 30-year old school record in consecutive home wins, which is now at 17.</p>\n<p>Even with all this success, Checketts’ humble persona reminds him constantly he could not have done this without his predecessors. He also knows there is still much more work to be done.</p>\n<p>“You know I haven’t really looked up yet,” Checketts said. “We still haven’t won a championship and we still have a lot of work to do, so me and my staff just keep working hard to reach that goal. They deserve a bunch of credit because the continuity of this staff has certainly helped me grow a lot.”</p>\n<p>However, just because coach Checketts cannot truly accept all the praise he deserves, there are certainly no lack of people willing to give him said praise for all the incredible work he has done here at UCSB including his own players.</p>\n<p>“He has made me a more mature person and a better ball player,” redshirt sophomore infielder J.J. Muno said. “I knew he was a good coach, and he had an amazing staff and he was going to take this program to new places and I wanted to be apart of it.”</p>\n<p>“He always pushes me to be a better and better player and I will always be thankful for that.” sophomore first baseman Austin Bush added. “He knows how to push you to your limits and I love that.”</p>\n<p>Changing the culture at UCSB has been a successful endeavor so far but it is not over yet and Checketts is committed for the ride after signing a contract extension through 2020.</p>\n<p>“Nothing great is ever easy and instilling this culture has not been an easy thing. It has taken away time from my wife and kids but luckily I have the best wife who continues to push me,” Checketts said. “But I am dedicated to this program and passionate about Gaucho baseball and I am here for the long haul.”</p>\n<p>Certainly turning around a program is no easy feat, but it certainly is a rewarding one. To know that the time and effort put in to changing a culture has not been a waste certainly must be fulfilling if nothing else. And there is no doubt that newer recruits are seeing the culture change at Santa Barbara and want to come here to be a part of something special.</p>\n<p>Andrew Checketts has been a tremendous coach for UCSB and hopefully he stays at UCSB until he retires. With his immense dedication there is no doubt he will one day get to Omaha and hoist a National Championship for the Gauchos.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Just recently it was announced that the Falcons broke their franchise-record with 540 total points scored in 2016. This makes complete sense when you have a top-3 wide receiver in Julio Jones lining up on the outside, an outstanding 1-2 punch of a running back committee with Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, and last but definitely not least the very talented Matt Ryan. Atlanta may have very well found themselves a gunslinger 2.0 in Ryan, better yet he might actually find himself as the league MVP when it’s all said and done. Now, with great offense comes great def- … actually, the Falcons are 27<sup>th</sup> overall in points allowed per game. Luckily, Seattle only averages 15 points per game on the road. Falcons’ fans can also rest even easier considering the Seahawks offensive line will be no match against defensive tackle Grady Jarrett. This youth sensation is sure to see his fair share of tackles, maybe even a sack or two.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive quickly into Seattle’s Wild Card round against Detroit last week. The Detroit defense didn’t show up to play at all, Matthew Stafford had arguably his worst game of the year, keep in mind he was throwing with a finger injury, and the Lions just weren’t as playoff-ready as everyone had figured them to be. Regardless, a great primetime showing from Seattle, however, change needs to be made before facing Atlanta this Saturday. Partially, points need to be put on the board. Therefore, Russell Wilson has to maintain his momentum and the receiving corps has to start catching everything thrown their way; although, for the most part, this game will only be won if they can stop the very productive Falcons offense. Enter Richard Sherman and Michael Bennett. The game plan here is simple gentlemen, Richard stop Julio and Michael sack Ryan. It’s time again for Sherman to prove his moniker of “I’m the best corner in the game” and for Bennett to be as disruptive to an opposing offense as ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Players to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>ATL: (QB) Matt Ryan / (DT) Grady Jarrett</p>\n<p>SEA: (CB) Richard Sherman / (DE) Michael Bennett</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>Atlanta Falcons</p>\n<p><strong>New England Patriots vs. Houston Texans</strong></p>\n<p>Saturday, Jan. 14, 2017</p>\n<p>8:15 PM E.T.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74833\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74833\" data-attachment-id=\"74833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/nfl-playoffs-divisional-round-matchups/pats-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?fit=913%2C795&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"913,795\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"pats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?fit=250%2C218&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?fit=888%2C773&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74833\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?resize=340%2C296\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Matt Stone / Boston Herald\" width=\"340\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?w=913&amp;ssl=1 913w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?resize=250%2C218&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pats.jpg?resize=768%2C669&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Matt Stone / Boston Herald</p></div>\n<p>Is Houston’s impressive pass-rush enough to upset Tom Brady and Bill Belichick’s postseason plans?</p>\n<p>It’s a familiar sight in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Ever since the start of the Tom Brady era, Gillette Stadium and its fans have gotten used to being active this late in January for postseason football. Only difference here is a big thing is missing. The league’s best tight-end, Rob Gronkowski, will not be active ever since his slew of injuries halfway through the season. What does this mean for the Patriots? The receivers will have to carry the slack, which they have been doing for the most part with Martellus Bennett filling in as big man and rookie Malcolm Mitchell surprising us all. However, it’ll be Julian Edelman in at the slot that will set the tempo for the game. Edelman is Tom Brady’s favorite, statistically speaking, target. As for run plays, the new protocol is hand it to LeGarrette Blount. He tried to make a statement last year, but has definitely gotten the idea through this season: Blount is the lead back for New England…and a scary good one for that matter.</p>\n<p>The “Upset Every Raiders Fan in the Nation” award goes to Houston, runner-up: Derek Carr’s season-ending injury. It was a close one considering the circumstances between the Texans and Raiders game, a little too close. Brock Osweiler actually showed his worth last week, even if that worth still comes nowhere near his $70 million cost. In the end, all the applause went to the Texans defense, and rightfully so. Thanks to standout performances by the two outside linebackers, Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus, the Raiders quarterback Connor Cook was hardly able to look down the field for more than a second without +200 lbs. of pressure rushing his way. Therefore, if the Texans wish to scrape a postseason victory on the road, they’ll have to manage Clowney and Mercilus’ playtime whilst making sure the play calls frequently involve blitz arrows pointing towards Brady.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Players to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>NE: (RB) LeGarrette Blount / (WR) Julian Edelman</p>\n<p>HOU: (LB) Jadeveon Clowney / (LB) Whitney Mercilus</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>New England Patriots</p>\n<p><strong>Dallas Cowboys vs. Green Bay Packers</strong></p>\n<p>Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017</p>\n<p>4:40 PM E.T.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74834\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74834\" data-attachment-id=\"74834\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/nfl-playoffs-divisional-round-matchups/dak-and-pack/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dak-and-pack\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74834\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?resize=356%2C237\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Hannah Foslien/Getty Images\" width=\"356\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?w=630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dak-and-pack.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74834\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Hannah Foslien/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>Offense aficionados eat your heart out; it’s going to be a long day of great football.</p>\n<p>Prescott and Elliott, two of the most talked about rookies in the NFL right now. When it mattered most as Dallas lost Romo to yet another injury, Prescott stepped forward and gave Cowboys fans hope. Now, all his work as the QB for “America’s team” has finally paid off…playoff time. Who better to compliment his play than rookie talent Elliott? It doesn’t stop there folks, who will protect Prescott from opposing rushers and open gaps for Elliot to rush through? The larger than life Cowboys offensive line, that’s who; I had to include them here considering they don’t get nowhere near enough media attention as they should for the work they do. At the end of the day though, the spotlight will remain focused on the rookies and whether or not they can lead their team to glory.</p>\n<p>Here’s some big news, really good if you’re a Cowboys fan and really bad if you’re a Packers fan, Jordy Nelson is ruled out for this divisional matchup. What on Earth will the Packers ever do now? Well, when your quarterback is Aaron Rodgers, you tend to find a way to win regardless of the situation. Randall Cobb, you’re up next. Last week, on only five receptions, Cobb caught 116 yards for three touchdowns. It doesn’t take an expert to realize that Cobb should remain isolated as much as possible in the slot receiver position. As for the big question, who will fill in on the outside for Jordy Nelson? Davante Adams, congrats, you’re the winner. Also against the Giants, Adams caught 125 yards for a touchdown on eight receptions. Wow, looks like either the receivers are really great or Rodgers is too good of a quarterback that losing his number one target doesn’t faze him. Well, the truth is that both are correct, and that will be proven as Green Bay is sure to put up a close game against Dallas.</p>\n<p><strong>Players to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>GB: (WR) Randall Cobb / (WR) Davante Adams</p>\n<p>DAL: (QB) Dak Prescott / (RB) Ezekiel Elliott</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>Green Bay Packers</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs</strong></p>\n<p>Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017</p>\n<p>8:20 PM E.T.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74835\" style=\"width: 418px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74835\" data-attachment-id=\"74835\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/nfl-playoffs-divisional-round-matchups/chiefs-and-steelers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?fit=1040%2C781&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1040,781\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"chiefs-and-steelers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?fit=888%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74835\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers-1024x769.jpg?resize=408%2C307\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of                                                                Peter Diana/Post-Gazette\" width=\"408\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chiefs-and-steelers.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Peter Diana/Post-Gazette</p></div>\n<p>Steelers’ best offensive trio in the league versus the Chiefs’ best defense in the league, surely this will be game of the week.</p>\n<p>It’s plain and simple; the Steelers swept the Dolphins last week. With the final score at 30-12, star players like Le’Veon Bell had 167 all-purpose yards for two touchdowns. Not to mention Antonio Brown’s 124 yards for two more touchdowns on five receptions, truly phenomenal play and very entertaining for the fans. The player to highlight here, however, is the man behind the passes, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Aged 34, Roethlisberger is still making plays he’d normally make five years ago. Which is why the Steelers postseason success will revolve around Big Ben’s consistency from here on out. Now, onto some media drama, Head Coach Mike Tomlin has been in the news recently for being picked apart on his true team role. “He’s a ‘cheerleader guy’”, “he runs an organization built on emotion, not on actual structure”, these are but a few things critics have stated against Tomlin’s tactics. The rational thing here is to not lash back at media outlets, rather do what every other NFL coach does before a game on Sunday; plan for a win. It’ll be a hard one, but Tomlin will be sure to come out to Arrowhead Stadium with something to prove.</p>\n<p>Marcus Peters, Eric Berry, Justin Houston, Dontari Poe. These are just a few of many highly esteemed players on the Chiefs defense, but surely postseason games can’t be won on defense alone. This is where Tyreek Hill comes in. Hill is arguably the fastest player in the entire NFL and will have opposing defensive coordinators scratching their head at how to shut him down. He can catch touchdowns, he can run them in, and heck, he can even return kicks. All around, Hill is the most exciting player for Kansas City right now, and he will once again have his day, this time in the postseason. Don’t count on him having all the fun however, running back Spencer Ware has been quite the replacement ever since Pro Bowler Jamaal Charles was injured early on in the season. Averaging 4.3 yards per hand-off, don’t be surprised when Ware is running straight through the center on 3<sup>rd</sup> down.</p>\n<p><strong>Players (Personnel) to Watch: </strong></p>\n<p>PIT: (QB) Ben Roethlisberger / (Head Coach) Mike Tomlin</p>\n<p>KC: (WR) Tyreek Hill / (RB) Spencer Ware</p>\n<p><strong>Game Pick: </strong>Kansas City Chiefs</p>\n<p><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>It’s the postseason, so every game from here on out is sure to be exciting. This late in the season, it’s all up to the star athletes to come through for their teams and really show how much they want that championship ring.
