Despite the oddity of my teacher frantically sprinting at my desk, this was not an isolated incident. My friends always joked that I was nocturnal due to my nighttime habits. I had been removed from the starting lineup for a varsity soccer game because I had fallen asleep and was late to the team bus. I once fell asleep 10 minutes into a statistics test, slept through the whole thing and had to beg my teacher to let me retake it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, I didn’t have narcolepsy.

To me, it has always felt like a waste of the scarce time we have to be alive. If the average human sleeps eight hours a night, in my mind, that means a third of one’s life is wasted not being present in the real world. When I was little, sleep meant less playtime. Now that I’m older, it means less productivity. So I have simply chosen to minimize my time in society’s nightly coma.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this refusal to submit to sleep might sound like a serious problem, I wore that tag as a badge of honor. I guess I was proud of evading rest by squeezing every bit of life out of my day through sheer determination. I never thought of myself as the smartest kid, but I was definitely one of the hardest workers. Got a whole chapter of chemistry to learn in one night but also want to hang out with my friends? Easy, I’ll pull the all-nighter, still make 6 a.m. practice and pull off a good grade, all in the span of 12 hours. This feat became almost a weekly routine; I liked being the kid that got everything done. I liked being reliable enough to take care of things. I liked not missing a moment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in my attempt to maximize the time I spent awake, I was actually hindering my quality of life by choosing not to rest. As I progressed through my late teenage years, I found myself coming down with the sniffles more and more, constantly forgetting things and not feeling present as I zombie’d through the days. All of these symptoms, alongside my sleep habits’ correlation with </span><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/action/resources/research-in-action/sleep-deprivation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heart disease, stunted metabolism, stifled growth and depression</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, made it clear this was not sustainable for adulthood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back, I wish I’d slept more. The stubborn mindset I had adopted might have made me feel invincible when I was 17, but it was not a feasible long-term strategy. If I had slept more, maybe I’d be a couple inches taller. Maybe my teachers would remember me less as that kid who drooled on their desks. Maybe it would have pushed back my expiration date a couple more years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since coming to this realization, my sleep habits have evolved into something a human being can actually operate on. I go to bed at 2 a.m. instead of 4 a.m. I intentionally avoid early morning classes so I can sleep in. Overall, I have changed how I approach the act of slumber because I have realized how crucial it is to human functionality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am well aware I may not be sleep’s best ambassador, but as someone who neglected it for years, I can confidently say that our society does not value it enough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, Family Feud’s host, Steve Harvey, was </span><a href=\"https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/05/07/steve-harvey-sleep-time-twitter.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">videotaped</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> preaching to his studio audience about the evils of sleep.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am well aware I may not be sleep’s best ambassador, but as someone who neglected it for years, I can confidently say that our society does not value it enough.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a third of your life. It ain’t but 24 hours in a day. You cannot be asleep eight hours a day. You can’t live in L.A. and wake up at 8 o’clock in the morning. It’s 11 o’clock on the east coast. The stock market (has) been open two hours. They [are] already making decisions about your life and your ass was sleep…He who loves to sleep and the folding of hands, poverty will set upon you like a thief in the night.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the sassiest game show host in the world cursing poverty upon you for catching some Z’s is certainly funny, the mindset Harvey projects on his audience reflects a huge flaw in the American “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” mindset.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Sleep Foundation,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adults between the ages of 18 to 64 should be sleeping between seven and nine hours a night to avoid health repercussions. However, according to</span><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/almost-one-third-americans-sleep-fewer-six-hours-night-180971116/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Smithsonian magazine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 32.9% of this population report sleeping less than six hours a night, a trend that has been rising continually for multiple decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long-term effects listed earlier alongside the short-term effects, such as reduced cognitive function and memory impairment, make a lack of sleep a dangerous entity to flirt with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what makes Steve Harvey’s comments so confusing is how alarmingly wrong his declaration was. According to a </span><a href=\"https://www.tuck.com/the-inequality-of-sleep/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> done by Tuck Sleep, there is a direct link between class inequality and the amount of sleep reported by study participants. As study respondents approached the poverty threshold, a higher percentage of the population reported sleeping less than the recommended seven hours a night.  Unsurprisingly, the income inequality underlying sleeping patterns also spills into racial inequality, with Hispanic and African Americans suffering from the highest rates of sleep deprivation. Turns out, a lack of sleep isn’t the secret to success — it’s a byproduct of poverty. Yes, Steve Harvey is right that the stock market is three hours ahead if you wake at 8 a.m. on the West Coast, but the stock market is rather inconsequential to an individual working two minimum wage jobs to provide for their family.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turns out, a lack of sleep isn’t the secret to success — it’s a byproduct of poverty.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how can we fix this? It’s a complicated question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s no surprise that the <a href=\"https://sleepopolis.com/blog/countries-most-sleep/\">five</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> countries</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where people get the most  sleep (New Zealand, France, Australia and Belgium) are all first-world countries with much more relaxed labor cultures than those of industrially-driven countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Singapore. These five countries have money, a healthy economy and less of a workhorse mentality throughout their general population. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the United States, specifically, the cycle of generational poverty that persists has proven to be increasingly tough to break. Those born lower-class tend to stay lower-class. The American dream is actually not a myth — it’s just increasingly harder to obtain. This is a problem when the only chance for sleep’s progress is with a restructured economy that props up the lower class financially. From there, this discussion can snowball into debates on healthcare, minimum wage and the taxing of the upper class. It’s all intrinsically connected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This problem is not going to be solved anytime soon, and I can’t say I’m very optimistic it will get solved at all based on the dramatic divisions within our government, the stifling progress that causes and the American attitude as a whole. Our society’s obsession with work is too entrenched. The people in charge of removing the economic barriers are more concerned with ulterior motives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, just know that Steve Harvey’s rich ass was absolutely wrong. You should definitely sink into your pillows and sleep in that extra hour. It’s good for you!</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Karamdashti didn’t get out of bed till 12:36 p.m. today</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-02-20-at-9.56.21-AM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kian Karamdashti</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kian Karamdashti is an Opinion and Nexustentialism staff writer.

Let’s be real here — fuck buddies are a fun concept for a Judd Apatow flick, but railing your friends is not the cure for a lonely and horny heart.

You may be thinking: “I can get my dick wet with someone I like hanging out with, no attachment necessary? What’s the catch?” Answer: Contrary to the popular belief that you have a cock for a brain, you’re a human with feelings. Sorry to pop your “I’m so strong I can fuck like a primal beast programmed to inseminate without attachment” cherry, but with coitus comes closeness. No ifs, ands or best friends’ butts about it.</p>\n<p>So what are we so afraid of that we opt for the nearest physical contact over a committed relationship? Well, let’s look at what a relationship entails: couple-y activities, pillow talk, family functions, calling the morning after, stress, making plans for the future, moving into the out-loud farting zone, oh dear this sounds horrible. Okay, okay; you win. Pal pooning definitely takes the prize. Just do me a favor and be cautious of which homedogs you’re dogging.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, if you are comfortable enough to consider someone a good friend, then you are vulnerable enough around them to give in emotionally. This is not to say that beautiful, healthy relationships can’t form out of friendships. On the contrary, they do all the time. My point is in the distinction between building a sexual relationship and fucking. You can date a buddy you have sex with, but it just doesn’t work with a fuck buddy. See the difference?</p>\n<p>Having a secret crush on someone you’re already sleeping with is dangerous territory. It’s like craving your favorite food while you’re chewing it — seriously confusing. It doesn’t take a Facebook update to know that if it feels complicated, it’s complicated, even if “casually fucking my friend” isn’t a relationship status as of yet.</p>\n<p>So why fuel the friendly fling fire? Two options: This person either secretly loves you and wants to use sexual intimacy as a crutch on the way to something more serious, or is a commitment-phobe and wants to use your body as a hollow shell to fuck his/her problems away. Do yourself a favor and step away from the insecure trap of loneliness and draw the line between people you hang with and people you bang with.</p>\n<p>My advice: Become friends with the people you fuck, not the other way around. And to all of you strangers out there who have “friended” me, take note on where I stand.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/friends-fun/","id":6434,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6433,6432,6431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Feminist Misconceptions Marginalize Mutual Pleasure and Sexual Equality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What does a feminist look like?

These stereotypes surrounding a common belief that women should be afforded equal opportunities and rights are groundless, and the misconception that a man cannot be a feminist is unjust in and of itself. As a sexually active human being, it is your duty to constantly question your beliefs and actions with regard to the equality of the sexes. If you are going to engage in an activity that is by definition founded in our inherent desire to be sexual, you have a responsibility to defend yourself, your choices and your partners.</p>\n<p>[media-credit id=20122 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-feminism.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1509767765\" data-slb-group=\"33388\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33391\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/kn-feminism/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-feminism.jpg?fit=3047%2C1181&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3047,1181\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"KN-feminism\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-feminism.jpg?fit=250%2C97&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-feminism.jpg?fit=888%2C344&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-feminism-250x96.jpg?resize=250%2C96\" alt=\"\" title=\"KN-feminism\" width=\"250\" height=\"96\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33391\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]I am a feminist.

You cannot talk about them like they don’t deserve your respect. If you want to have hot, steamy sex, I guarantee you will not get it from a woman you don’t value, or at least not one who is worth your time. Do not be ashamed to be called a feminist. If you love women, love their bodies, urges, minds and power, defend their right to have those passions and free will.</p>\n<p>Of course there are dozens of branches of the feminist movement, and not all will agree with my opinions. I am not a radical activist; I believe in a sexually liberal feminism that brings attention not to the dominance of male control and desire, but to the equality of human sexuality. I also know there are many religious readers out there who disagree with any form of promiscuity, but I encourage those people to find a feminist position that complements their faith. Feminist theology is a broadly researched and written-on topic, so don’t let your disgust with my opinions keep you from connecting with your chance to mobilize.</p>\n<p>I would like to propose a new way of thinking — a kind of “sexy feminism.” It’s 2011 for goodness sake; look how far we’ve come! Certainly we can all agree that equality of the sexes is not embodied by an unattractive person we don’t want to fuck because he/she is too busy picketing instead of showering. It is totally hot to feel wanted, needed and respected for my body and my mind — mutual acceptance is a turn-on.</p>\n<p>So please, find the feminist within. The power to respect is blind to sex and gender. Bring out your desire to set people’s minds straight. And absolutely never let someone tell you that sleeping around makes you a slut. Girls, I am here to tell you that sucking on cock, fulfilling your fetish fantasies, getting titty-fucked and being bent over and railed are all within the boundaries of being proud to be a woman and an activist for women’s rights.</p>\n<p>Safe sex is the most important priority. After that, sluttiness just doesn’t exist.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/feminist-misconceptions-marginalize-mutual-pleasure-sexual-equality/","id":6435,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6434,6433,6432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Going Down Onto the Finer Techniques of Fellatio","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Warning: The following content may contain offensive material and be inappropriate for, say, my parents.

Let’s talk about blowjobs, baby.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"989238292\" data-slb-group=\"32703\"><img data-attachment-id=\"32705\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/kn-blowjob2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg?fit=3044%2C1272&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3044,1272\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"KN-blowjob2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg?fit=250%2C104&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg?fit=888%2C371&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2-250x104.jpg?resize=250%2C104\" alt=\"\" title=\"KN-blowjob2\" width=\"250\" height=\"104\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32705\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg?resize=250%2C104&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg?resize=1024%2C428&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/KN-blowjob2.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>What you men so brazenly call “doming it up,” I see as a true art.

Why do I begin this discussion with nuts over shaft, you may ask? Because friend, testicles are genitalia too, and quite frankly, they’re sick of constantly being neglected. They feel overshadowed by their cylindrical counterpart, doomed to a life of always the ballsmaid and never the dong. As long as you’re gentle, don’t be afraid to lightly massage them, lick them or even pop one in your mouth for a quick soak. They are very sensitive, which is a double-edged sword. Do nothing extreme, or he’ll tear up in sheer anger. But the right touch can take him over the edge.</p>\n<p>Tip. There is a reason why “just the tip” is actually appealing to a guy, as that’s where he feels most of his pleasure. Don’t forget to come up for air every once in a while to avoid passing out while giving his tip some one-on-one time. And this little tip from me to you leads me to my next point…</p>\n<p>Deep-throating. OK girls, take a deep breath (through your nose), you can do this. Try to think of a distant place, like a tropical beach or some other beautiful I.V. equivalent, and imagine you are there instead of esophagus-deep in johnson. The reason why guys are obsessed with you doing this is two-fold: 1) Again, the tip gets stimulated, but this time by the inside of your body, and 2) Porn.</p>\n<p>Hands. Unless you’re tied up or handcuffed — in which case, more power to you — your hands should always serve as the supporting actors in your one-mouth-show performance. A penis doesn’t exactly have the resistance of a bar of lead, but it can handle quite a bit of pumping and pressure. Basically, hold on tight kids, ‘cause this is going to be a bumpy ride.</p>\n<p>Eyes. Look up at him (also porn).</p>\n<p>Teeth. The age-old question: To use teeth or not to use teeth? That’s a direct Shakespeare quote, by the way. The ol’ vampire blowjob. There are two schools of thought on this matter. Some say even trying is bound to end badly. And well, others like it rough. Just keep in mind that you aren’t grating cheese here, and it isn’t exactly the kind of thing you want to be biting into anyway.</p>\n<p>Jizzing. “Spit or swallow” is so five-minutes-ago. There are so many more creative ways to skeet and so many more interesting things to skeet on. Of course, swallowing is still an option if that’s your cup of semen. But consider this — and yes, I know this is also rooted in years of boy-on-computer alone-time memories with a sock — ask him to come on you. The chest and face seem to be popular choices, and might I add that it is a surprisingly refreshing exfoliant. Just keep your eyes closed or this sacred advice will land you in the emergency room with an embarrassing medical bill to explain.</p>\n<p>So open wide and say “ahh,” you are now equipped with the advice to give an outstanding oral performance. Don’t get choked up, put your member where your mouth is and rock that fellacio like it’s 1999.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32703\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32703\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-02/finer-techniques-fellatio/","id":6436,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6435,6434,6433],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
