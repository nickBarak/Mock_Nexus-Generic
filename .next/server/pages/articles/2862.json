They’re sculpted in the devil’s own image, with massive torpedo-like bodies and gaping jaws. They choose to take a bite out of you, and you’re pretty much done for.</p>\n<p>At first, the feeling creeps up and wraps around you like a constricting vest, and makes you wish you didn’t have any limbs dangling off of your board and into the unseen depths below.</p>\n<p>That feeling is panic. Primal innate terror — your fight or flight mechanism. In the ocean, that crucial inner “oh shit” alarm kicks in when your body suspects the presence of a predator swimming nearby.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it manifests as an eerie tingle or the gut feeling that something is not right. The water becomes hostile and your hackles rise.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry,” you think to yourself. Science suggests that sharks don’t truly appreciate the taste of human flesh, rarely attack humans and will probably spit you out if they happen to bite out of curiosity or hunger.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s a fact you’ve got to accept or quit swimming in the sea. The Pacific Ocean is our backyard. Among other things, it’s a hotspot for great white sharks, among other species — most docile, some dangerous, most just dumb and hungry.</p>\n<p>Big predators are out there — charging through the unknown beneath, free of conscience or notions of guilt. They don’t care for your career aspirations or how much your family loves you and don’t have qualms about taking a bite out of you just to see how you taste. Inside, they sing their blissful song, “Nat-Ur-Al. Sur-Vi-Val!”</p>\n<p>Nobody truly thinks they’re going to be the one. It’s hard to even start pondering, but sometimes you can’t stop yourself.</p>\n<p>We don’t know what’s going to happen out there. There’s no way to say that the next time we go surfing our own lives won’t be placed in jeopardy because of a shark. But, there’s also no way to say that you won’t die in a fiery car crash on your way to the beach one day, or perhaps a heart attack on the shitter when you’re 95.</p>\n<p>I take some comfort in that fact that you can’t blame sharks for what they do. They aren’t monsters, despite their appearance. They are just big scary-ass animals looking for lunch. And I can’t begrudge them that, as much as I fear and grieve their attacks. Universal balancing power resides in a shark’s jaws just as it does within everything in nature.</p>\n<p>To most landlubbers, surfing with the risk of a shark attack hanging on your head seems like an unnecessary risk, but that’s clouded thinking.</p>\n<p>Putting your life on the line builds character. Although I could think of more dangerous activities, surfing does pose significant risks, including marine predators. Engaging yourself in vigorous pursuit of your passions is the staple of a healthy life. While danger may sometimes encroach on that sphere, it’s reflective of a strong personality and an unassuming soul to move forward in the face of danger to accomplish personal goals.</p>\n<p>It’s an internal decision you have to make with yourself and take to the grave, although most of us will be fortunate enough to not have to take that decision to an early grave. And should that happen, you’ll know, in your last moments or beyond, that your life wasn’t taken in vain — that you were taken as part of a grander plan, a force that guides and cycles life.</p><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The second annual Dance Marathon took place on campus on Saturday night at Pavilion Gym to raise money for the Santa Barbara Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>Dance Marathon raised a total of $35,347.11 for Cottage Hospital, the local chapter of Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and exceeded its fundraising goal of $25,000. Each of 38 dance teams represented one patient from Cottage Hospital and entered after meeting the minimum entry requirements. To celebrate the funds they raised, participants engaged in a 12-hour-long dance party from noon until midnight, partaking in activities, entertainment and free food from local businesses such as Panda Express, Sorriso Italiano and Silvergreens.</p>\n<p>Event co-chair and alumnus Sean Thompson said Dance Marathon will continue to host the event in an effort to increase their fundraising goals. This year’s raised amount surpassed last year’s total of $12,791.84.</p>\n<p>“We up the ante every year,” Thompson said. “This year our goal was to double the fundraising, double the amount of people and next year, who knows?”</p>\n<p>According to co-chair of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biological science major Molly Morrison, about 400 participants raised money, an increase from last year’s 200 participants. Morrison said this is indicative of an upward trend in participation she hopes to continue.</p>\n<p>“This is the second annual event and we’re hoping to continue for generations and generations,” Morrison said. “Children’s Miracle Network nationally reached out to the UCSB campus as they were looking to extend their reach on the west coast. They came to UCSB and we’re here now.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said Dance Marathon began in 1991 at Indiana University in honor of Ryan White, a student who was expelled from his middle school in 1984 after being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. The event was then adopted by Children’s Miracle Network Hospital.

We can get together and feel like we can help donate and have a good time together at the same time.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_61473\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"216681619\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61473\" data-attachment-id=\"61473\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/dance-marathon_alex-gonzalez-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425172318\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-61473\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Dance Marathon raised a total of $35,347.11.  <em>Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/","id":2859,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[2858,2857,2856],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

SJP President and second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur was the main speaker for the presentation and began the event speaking about the many ways in which Palestine is affected by the occupation and apartheid of the region, as well as the U.S.’s relationship with the conflict.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, the problems in Palestine span a wide range of humanitarian issues that transcend the political motives controlling the region.</p>\n<p>“In regards to Palestine, it connects to women’s issues, queer issues, environmental problems, state violence, immigration and displacement of indigenous populations,” Kaur said. “It goes beyond transnational borders because it is much more than people perceive. It does not just affect one group of people with one issue.”</p>\n<p>Kaur said the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting case of Michael Brown in the U.S. is directly tied to Palestinian oppression because the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) trained some members of the American police force who were active in Ferguson.</p>\n<p>“The government in Palestine is super fearful of public opinion and resistance. But the IDF trains the police in the U.S. to have the same fear,” Kaur said. “It is connected to the Ferguson issue because the police here are trained to oppress resistance at all violent costs. It was a case of rampant anti-blackness.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, police brutality leading to the death of innocent people is modeled after “the hatred and strategy of the Israeli army.” Kaur said the strategy stems from the fear of possible opposition, aiming to abuse people from the lower class and encouraging the marginalization of these people in a consistent manner.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental science major Nia Mitchell said her historically marginalized Afro-Cuban culture helps her understand the ongoing oppression in Israel.</p>\n<p>“I identify as Afro-Cuban and I realize that my people are and have been dominated and oppressed,” Mitchell said. “This is what happens in all lands. Therefore, it is so clear for me to see how it is impossible to take away issues like women oppression because of interconnectivity between dominance and exploitation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61431\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61431\" data-attachment-id=\"61431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/occupation_sam-aragon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the interesection of palestine and other human rights issues.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424978633\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Occupation_Sam Aragon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61431\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-1024x678.jpg?resize=365%2C242\" alt=\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the intersection of Palestine and other human rights issues.

Women have very little rights there and this will unfortunately most likely continue.”</p>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Jeremy Garza said racism exists in different forms in the U.S. and Palestine.</p>\n<p>“All forms of racism are not the same around the world. For example, we see in the Ferguson case that there is discrimination against blacks,” Garza said. “There are also a lot of African immigrants in Israel and they are not given documentation, rights, work, and are only provided with segregation.”</p>\n<p>According to Garza, African women are being sterilized in Israel because the government wants to control the population.</p>\n<p>“These women are not provided with equal rights but are being sterilized which is an example of how the government controls their people,” Garza said. “This is a tactic that the U.S. has used plenty of times in South America and with Native Americans.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Shahryar Mooraj said female immigrants in Gaza must also face sterility checkpoints and are unable to obtain medical assistance such as medicine, ambulances and local doctors.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of unfairness in Palestine, especially with the issue of sterilizing women at checkpoints. Women are being sterilized but do not get to experience medical attention and it is definitely unfair for Palestinians,” Mooraj said. “They do not have access to medical aid in Gaza which is a denial of life. There are no ambulances or speedy recoveries.”</p>\n<p>Mooraj said his immigrant lifestyle in the U.S. is much easier than the life of Palestinian immigrant because he is granted basic civil rights and allowed to travel.</p>\n<p>“I am an international student myself and cannot imagine the troubles that immigrants face in Palestine,” Mooraj said. “The restriction of movement of the Palestinian people is wrong because they have been there for years and are denied public services. I fortunately have not faced such discrimination in the U.S. so far as an immigrant student.”</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, people should be allowed to relocate and travel in their search for suitable living conditions.</p>\n<p>“At the core, this is really a human rights violation because people need to have the right to move around and find comfort,” Mooraj said. “They need to be able to grow and expand. People in Gaza and the West Bank just do not have that and I find it to be completely awful.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61440\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61440\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/","id":2861,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2860,2859,2858],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
