Gaskin was President of West Valley College for three years prior to her appointment as SBCC’s President in July 2012. Gaskin focused on a variety of issues including fiscal transparency for the college, campus facility modernization and addressing SBCC student concerns in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said her decision to retire was partially due to SBCC’s positive accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for the Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, a major focus during her presidency was to close the student achievement gap between different ethnicities.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received several funds to experiment and launch innovative programs to close that gap or disparity,” Gaskin said. “We’ve also ramped up our academic counseling support. We had one of the higher ratios in the state when it came to student academic counseling ratios.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of SBCC Jack Friedlander said Gaskin smoothly transitioned into her role during her first year of presidency.</p>\n<p>“She came in and calmed the waters at the college and in the community and helped reestablish relationships internally and externally,” Friedlander said “She didn’t come in with a preconceived agenda”.</p>\n<p>According to Friedlander, the recruitment process for a new president is in its early stages.</p>\n<p>“We have a profile of what the ideal candidate would bring,” Friedlander said. “Particularly, people who apply write an essay to write about how their experiences and characteristics align with what we’re looking for and how they would deal with the challenges our campus is facing.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Students President and second-year business administration major Isaac Eaves said Gaskin listened to student voices on campus.</p>\n<p>“She always had the time to communicate with students and build a connection,” Eaves said. “She’s been working hard to make sure that we have a voice because in the past — there’s been a lot of micromanaging from the Board of Trustees and down.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Student Trustee and political science and sociology double major Tyler Gibson said Gaskin has addressed issues regarding “Measure S,” a bond proposition authorizing funds to improve campus facilities.</p>\n<p>“In 2014, we tried to improve [SBCC’s] infrastructure,” Gibson said. “[Gaskin] addressed concerns because of Measure S. We’ve tried to strategize ways to continue to be an effective community campus while keeping the faculty and students in mind.”</p>\n<p>Gibson said many students were surprised about Gaskin’s announcement.</p>\n<p>“Most people that I’ve talked to said ‘No way,’ ‘Wait when? Next year? Didn’t she just get here?’” Gibson said. “She’s somebody I look up to, so it was very shocking to see her announcing about retiring.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said one of the defining moments in her career as president was the events of May 23 last year in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If there was one moment that has been set apart from all the others, it is the tragic loss of lives in Isla Vista,” Gaskin said. “It is the antithesis of what anyone wants from our students. Learning and teaching is a truly special endeavor, and for something like that to happen is an assault to the core of who we are.”<br>\nGaskin said she hopes to travel after her retirement.</p>\n<p>“I want to have the time to travel,” Gaskin said. “I’ve never taken a trip in the 35 years in September or October. It would be so unusual to travel then.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

in the Isla Vista Clinic building to discuss which services should be the first to receive funding if I.V. becomes a Community Service District (CSD) in the Nov. 2016 county elections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday’s meeting was the fifth of 11 meetings the Initiate organized for community members to discuss the framework and specific services that may be offered in a CSD. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, the group of about 15 attendees made provisional plans to spend $119,000 out of the $255,000 they expect to have after the CSD’s administration costs.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The CSD’s budget for funding services would come from revenue from a Utility User Tax (UUT), as stipulated in Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group tentatively decided to ask the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to approve the following budget: $50,000 for hiring a grant writer, $30,000 to begin developing a new parking program, $25,000 for a tenant-landlord mediation program, $8,000 for a Municipal Advisory Council (M.A.C.) and $6,000 to remove graffiti, possibly by painting murals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy CEO of Santa Barbara County Martin Erickson said forming a CSD in I.V. through AB 3 might lead to more cooperation between the university, county and I.V. governance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think part of AB 3’s existence is going to have the County and UCSB look at this area differently and [result in] more partnerships,” Erickson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Organizer for Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said although the CSD will have a relatively small budget, it will be able to make significant improvements in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the CSD is it’s going to do things and those things are going to have an impact on Isla Vista,” Elliott said. “These things are not going to cost very much, but they’re going to do a lot for the community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliott said the group’s tentative planning served an important purpose, even though it did not result in an official budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not just all out here running around like crazy … we are figuring it out now, we do have plans already in process; we are ready for governance; we can do this,” Elliott said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said spending $50,000 on a grant writer would be a good decision because it could yield a positive return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems like a very good idea because that’s a position that could generate several times its cost,” Ebenstein said.</span></p>\n<div

it.”</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group plans to discuss funding for a new police program and increased lighting of public parks and sidewalks in I.V. at future meetings, the next

SB 295 requires the State Fire Marshal to perform annual oil pipeline inspections, rather than every two years. Under SB 414, the Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) must research the best utilization of commercial fisherman and other mariners as quick responders for oil spill containment. SB 414 also requires OSPR report chemical dispersant use to the legislature and research prevention and containment of oil spills.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 684 (AB 684) implements more efficient spill-prevention technology such as automatic shutoff systems, leak detection technology and sectionalized block valves in sensitive coastal environments. According to the bill, installation of these technologies will be complete by Jan. 1, 2018, and the State Fire Marshal will have adopted the necessary regulations to effectively assess risk analysis of pipelines by July 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Jackson said she believes more frequent pipeline inspection could have prevented the Refugio Beach Oil Spill, as many pipeline failures are largely due to damage from chemicals added to oil for faster transport.</p>\n<p>“As oil has become more viscous and more problematic, there are more corrosive chemicals being used to thin it out so it can be transported more easily, and these are having a tremendous and detrimental effect on the pipelines,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said while the three bills are a “step forward” in protecting the environment from oil spill damage, oil production still poses as threat to surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>“As long as we have oil production in environmentally sensitive areas like those in Santa Barbara County, we live under threat of damaging oil spills,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double major Nicholas Frey said the bills are only temporary solutions to the greater problem of fossil fuel dependence.</p>\n<p>“While they were good, it was just kind of putting on a little Band-Aid to a much larger problem,” Frey said. “I would’ve wanted to see more transitioning out of fossil fuels and actually removing said pipelines.”</p>\n<p>UCSB CALPIRG campus organizer Alena Simon said California needs further legislation that transitions it toward alternative energy.</p>\n<p>“I think we’d like to see California go 100 percent renewable and not actually rely on these dirty fossil fuels at all,” Simon said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said California should seek renewable energy “as rapidly as possible.”</p>\n<p>“We can work to make pipelines safer, but as long as there is oil drilling there will be oil spills,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>EAB Co-chair and second-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said he hopes legislators continue to pass legislation to impose tighter controls on the fossil fuel industry prior to another oil spill, rather than in response.</p>\n<p>“It stinks for me that we have to have these spills before we can pass tougher legislature on oil and fossil fuel industries,” Berry said. “I’m glad to see them passed, and I think frequent checks will be better … because it’s never if a spill’s going to happen, it’s when, so hopefully they can be checked and prevented.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting on Wednesday, alleging emergency personnel mishandled the events leading up to Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>Hoover released the following statement regarding the events of Sunday morning:</p>\n<p>“On 10/11/2015 at approximately 4:40 a.m., SBSO Dispatch received a call for medical emergency in the 6700 block of Abrego Road for a report of a male subject bleeding from the arm and running around in the street screaming for help. SBSO Deputies, Fire, and AMR responded to assist.</p>\n<p>The victim, Andres Sanchez, suffered from a large laceration around his right arm, near the elbow.  The injury was later determined to have been caused by the victim punching his arm through a plate glass window.  Sanchez was combative and displayed symptomology of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Sanchez was restrained on a backboard and transported to Cottage Hospital Emergency Room by ambulance. Based on witness statements at the scene, Sanchez had struck the apartment window with his right arm and began running around, yelling and acting strangely.  He was bleeding profusely. Several of the witnesses attempted to restrain Sanchez and provide first aid. Sanchez’s roommate believed Sanchez may have ingested some type of synthetic drug, possibly LSD or K2.</p>\n<p>While at Cottage Hospital, Sanchez became unresponsive.  Advanced life-saving efforts were attempted, but were unsuccessful.  Sanchez was pronounced dead at approximately 6:51 a.m.  Next of kin was notified by Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital Emergency Room staff. The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is conducting a death investigation to determine cause and manner of death.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said fire and medics were dispatched “within seconds” of Melgoza’s 911 call, and deputies arrived within three and a half minutes.</p>\n<p>“I was able to pull up the dispatch log and I can see exactly when the call came in and when it was given to fire and medics,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses’ claims that a translation service was not available following the incident is “totally false,” and deputies do not notify families of tragedies by phone.</p>\n<p>“Foot Patrol has many translators. We have staff and we have deputies that speak Spanish,” Plastino said. “We would never call someone on the phone … we call down to the agency that’s in charge of that area.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he wants to provide “100 percent transparency” regarding the events preceding Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>“I am so absolutely positive that we did everything absolutely right,” Plastino said. “I want everything to go to the press because I feel so confident in how we handled this.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said deputies’ demeanor on scene is often misconstrued as harsh.</p>\n<p>“At the moment of the crisis we are the ones that have to do the job, and in order to do that, you have to put up your brick wall … your mental armor to deal with the situation at hand,” Plastino said. “That can come across to some people as being uncaring, unfeeling, unemotional, unsympathetic at the moment.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said although he does not agree with Ariana, Baker, Hernandez, Melgoza and Ramirez, he thinks they are asking “good questions.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely 100 percent glad that they are asking these questions, that they are questioning the way things are being done, because things aren’t always being done the way they should be,” Plastino said. “In this incident, I disagree with their perception of things.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses alluded to false events, causing Sanchez’s family “unwarranted grief.”</p>\n<p>“I could care less all day long if they want to question law enforcement,” Plastino said, “but when it affects the family and their grieving process for their son who’s died, then it’s an exception, because it causes them more grief.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, deputies are trained in basic first aid, but are not equipped to handle severe injuries.</p>\n<p>“The first aid kit that we carry is enough to help somebody with a stubbed toe, like a small cut,” Plastino said. “We’re trained in basic first aid, which is something anybody can go get … but it’s not advanced life support … we can apply pressure, we can do CPR.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said it is “frustrating” for deputies to be first to arrive at the scene of a medical emergency because they do not have the means to provide the care needed.</p>\n<p>“We want to assist, but we’re powerless because we don’t have the skills, the equipment or everything else that needs to be done during a major incident like that,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he agrees with the witnesses that all police vehicles should contain an emergency kit.</p>\n<p>“Here is where we need to do a better job — there was a criticism that we did not carry a first aid kit,” Platino said. “That’s gonna be addressed … Every single one of [our] cars needs to have a first aid kit.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, one of the two IVFP deputies who responded had a flashlight when approaching Sanchez, but the allegation that a deputy carried a baton is “absolutely untrue.”</p>\n<p>“One of them got out with a flashlight, and the flashlights are not very big, so I don’t know how that could have been construed as a baton. The batons are long,” Plastino said. “That flashlight was never used in any way to restrain the young man, it was never used against anybody that was a bystander. It wasn’t used at all.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is “very impressed” with the witnesses’ response when Sanchez approached them.</p>\n<p>“There was a woman who was assisting, trying to keep him down, because he was trying to get up,” Plastino said. “Hats off to those who assisted him because with blood loss, the more worked up you are, the more blood you can lose. They were absolutely doing the best job they could as bystanders.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the deputies’ behavior alleged in the witnesses’ accounts can “not be tolerated,” and he asks for evidence that such misconduct occurred.</p>\n<p>“Whoever is propagating that kind of nonsense, I would ask them to come forward and provide proof of it,” Plastino said. “If there is proof of it, we need to have a full-blown investigation.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, officers will meet with the Sanchez family today to ensure the two deputies did everything in their power when addressing the situation.</p>\n<p>“The sheriff is meeting actually with the family today and going to show them everything so that they can rest assured that we handled their son properly,” Plastino said, “that he was not mistreated in any way, that no part of this was mistreatment of their son.”</p>\n<p>[<em>Correction: This article previously stated San Diego deputies notified the Sanchez family of Andres Sanchez’s death; however, it was Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital that did so.
