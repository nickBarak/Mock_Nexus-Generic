\r\n</script> \n<p>Then, at five years old, she made her first basket all by herself and instantly knew basketball was the right path for her.</p>\n<p>“My brother used to always say, ‘Look at the front of the rim and just shoot it.’ I did it one time and it went in and I was so excited,” Mason said. “I ran in and told my dad, ‘I made it! I made it!’ Right there, I was like ‘I want to do this.’”</p>\n<p>Just like that, Mason was enthralled with the game of basketball.</p>\n<p>“I was outside all the time … all the time,” Mason said. “Every chance I could get, I was playing with guys and playing with people older than me.”</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to college, where Mason is playing for the UCSB women’s basketball team. The passionate little kid who grew up wanting to play professionally is still inside her and evident to all around her.</p>\n<p>“She’s the first one in the gym most of the time and the last one out of here, always grabbing the freshmen to spend extra time with them on their skills,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “She’s just a basketball junkie. That’s the fun part of it — she eats, breathes, lives and is passionate about the game.”</p>\n<p>Now in her senior year, Mason is experiencing a breakout season. While not known for her offense in previous years, Mason is one of the three seniors anchoring the Gaucho attack this year, which has seen tremendous improvement from previous seasons. The senior guard ranks third on the team in scoring at 12.8 points per game, shooting an impressive 42.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“Destini on the court is not too different than Destini off the court — just very, very high energy,” teammate Nicole Nesbit said. “She’s a very passionate player. She’s very into the game. You can see it all over her face when she plays.”</p>\n<p>Entering this season, Mason’s career-high was 13 points. That total has been shattered on four separate occasions, the most recent coming during UCSB’s first Big West game of the year at rival Cal Poly where Mason totaled 24 points. She also broke her career-high in field goals made as she went 10-17 from the field.</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly game foreshadowed good things to come during conference play for Mason. Despite the team’s struggle, Mason has continued to improve during Big West play.</p>\n<p>Mason increased her field goal percentage to 46.9 percent and has elevated her game from long range, knocking down six three-pointers, which is just one shy of her total from nonconference play. She’s also upped her percentage from behind the arc from 31.8 percent to 35.3 percent.</p>\n<p>“Destini is a very talented player and I think she’s definitely starting to come into her own and feel confident, especially on the offensive end,” Nesbit said. “She is very good in transition; she’s a good attacker. She has good size and can usually post up smaller guards. She has a very nice mid-range jumper. She can shoot the three as well, but doesn’t as often. She’s a complete offensive player and I think she’s starting to believe that.”</p>\n<p>However, Mason is much more than a scorer. It may not show up in the box scores, but since her arrival to Santa Barbara, Mason has served as the defensive stopper for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think I just have a niche for defense,” Mason said. “Defense is just really about heart, which I have, and not wanting to get scored on, which I have, and (then some) positioning, technique and strength.”</p>\n<p>Yet, possibly the biggest asset Mason has given to the Gauchos this season is her versatility. With an undersized roster, Mitchell has often moved the 5’8’’ Mason to the power forward position, although Mason has been known to play positions one through four all season long.</p>\n<p>“I like watching the game and I think that’s why, being a four player this year, it came kind of easy because I watch it so much,” Mason said. “It just came natural because I knew their positioning and what they were looking for.”</p>\n<p>The transition has actually aided Mason who, as a guard, leads the team in rebounding with 6.0 boards per game. She also averages 0.9 steals and 0.5 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“Just having so many players (from Rutgers) that are in the [WNBA], I tell her that she has to be great at everything,” Mitchell said. “You can’t just do one thing well to be a WNBA player, so I just challenge her every day to be a complete player and not just one-dimensional and I think her versatility will give her a look.”</p>\n<p>Altogether, Mason seems to be making the strongest case she can to the WNBA. Add all of Mason’s accomplishments together along with the fact that she serves as the team’s vocal leader this season and Mason easily makes a case for the most improved player under Mitchell’s reign.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of those that it’s the reason you coach, and you smile because I can remember walking into this gym for my first skill workouts and I saw her sitting in the corner, but at that point she had asked for her release and was transferring from UCSB,” Mitchell said. “That’s what you want from young women is for them to mature and grow and be independent and confident in who they are as an individual and as a basketball player. So, you have to smile for her now being out there confident, the jokester and the ultimate leader.”</p>\n<p>If looking closely, Mason’s game actually resembles one of the great players to play in the WNBA and one of her role models: Deanna Nolan, the three-time WNBA champion and 2006 Finals MVP. Both are long guards that have incredible athleticism and while not the flashiest players, make a substantial mark on every game.</p>\n<p>“[Nolan] would jump out of the gym. The elevation on her jumper was ungodly,” Mitchell said. “She also played with that little cocky edge, which I’m okay with, and I think all the great players have somewhat. Some people could misread it, but to me it shows she’s passionate; she plays with a level of excitement that you don’t take that away from players.”</p>\n<p>But as a student of the game, Nolan isn’t the only player that can be seen in Mason’s game. When looking closely, you might see pieces of a pair of L.A. Laker guards.</p>\n<p>“I copied a lot of people, but that’s okay because that’s how you get better,” Mason said. “I take bits and pieces of a lot of different players, so [Nolan] definitely with the way she flows with the offense with the ball. Also, Kobe; I like his fadeaway, so I do his fadeaway and Nick Young, just the way he gets excited about every shot.”</p>\n<p>While earning a spot in the WNBA is extremely difficult with the limited number of teams and roster spots, Mitchell believes Mason’s ability to be an all-around player makes her dream a possible reality.</p>\n<p>“I think she’ll definitely get the looks, in whether she gets training camps or invites to any of the combines,” Mitchell said. “Never give up on your dreams if that’s her dream and we’ll help her keep working hard and hopefully she’ll have a chance at some point.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/turning-a-lifelong-dream-into-reality/","id":562,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[561,560,559],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Struggling Gauchos Host Hawaii Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-070.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-070.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB tries to rebound from a three-game losing streak","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Losing seven of its last eight games, the UCSB women’s basketball team is ready to start anew and begin the second round of Big West play.

Even on the offensive side, that helped us because we were able to play a little more physical. I’ll be interested to see if we can play two small guards at the same time with [Onome and Nicole.]”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine essentially play four power forwards and a point guard, so while they don’t have incredible height like the Gauchos have seen in the past, they are a bigger team overall and play an extremely physical game.</p>\n<p>“They’re physical, so it’s not just going to be a test on the basketball side of it, but it’s a physical test and a mental test because they beat you up,” Mitchell said. “We will have to be ready to play blue-collar basketball.”</p>\n<p>The biggest target for Hawaii on offense will be senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who is a force down low despite the fact that she stands at just 5’11’’. She ranks sixth in the Big West in points at 15.8 per game, third in field goal percentage at 51.7 percent and third in rebounding, grabbing 9.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“She’s a beast. We’ve talked about getting in front of her because if she catches it, you’re done,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware said. “We have to box her out, so we’re going to try to contain her on that end of scoring and boxing her out because she gets a lot of their rebounds. She’s averaging a double-double.”</p>\n<p>Jackson will address the Gauchos’ biggest weakness because all season long, Santa Barbara has struggled with consistency, especially on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>In its last two games against UC Irvine and UC Davis, UCSB has played well in the first half and remained in contention at halftime, but then fallen apart in the second half, falling prey to defensive breakdowns. Against the Aggies, the Gauchos gave up a fatal 47 points in the second, compared to 35 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“Both games were close at one point and we let them get away from us,” Watkins said. “I think the biggest lesson we learned is that we have to put two halves together.”</p>\n<p>One of those defensive breakdowns has been failing to rebound in critical moments. Rebounding makes all the difference for Santa Barbara, which averages 40.7 boards per game in victories and 31 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be physical,” Watkins said. “We haven’t rebounded as well as coach would’ve liked this season so far, but we’re looking to turn our season around and it starts with rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Although the focus won’t be on offense tonight as UCSB hasn’t struggled nearly as much on that end of the floor, Hawaii is a great defensive team. The Rainbow Wahine top the conference in scoring defense, holding teams to 65.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for our kids’ mindsets is that they play majority man defense,” Mitchell said. “They can take a lot of switches because they’re basically all the same size, so we just have to make the right reads out of that. We have to trust and make the extra pass.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>“At the end of the day, it’s tough when you’re in the game for 40 minutes and play so hard and compete and leave it all on the court and the scoreboard doesn’t indicate the game we played,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “But, my head’s still up; these players are going to keep their heads up because we played a really good team and we had every opportunity to win.”</p>\n<p>Halfway through Big West play, the Gauchos now stand at 6-15 overall and 1-7 in conference, losers of eight of their last nine. Hawaii improves to 11-9 overall and 5-3 in league.</p>\n<p>“It’s my responsibility to make sure we focus on what we need to do and continue to stay positive and stay together,” Mitchell said. “We’re now at the halfway mark of Big West play and I will not give up. There will be no fat lady singing until hopefully we’re cutting down nets at the Honda Center.”</p>\n<p>Down three just minutes into the second half, senior guard Destini Mason picked up her fourth foul. Mitchell decided to leave her senior in the game. The decision paid off as Mason scored UCSB’s next five points, sparking a 9-2 run to take a 42-36 advantage.</p>\n<p>“That’s always a tough decision from a coach’s standpoint (to leave her in with her fourth or take her out),” Mitchell said. “You’re looking at [Mi’Chael Wright and Melissa Maragnes] as freshmen and Clair only being here a couple weeks, so I had to go with a senior and trust she’d make the right decisions and not foul out. We needed her on the court.”</p>\n<p>However, Hawaii would not go away. The Rainbow Wahine kept the score close by getting to the free throw line, shooting 22-24 from the charity stipe, including 19-20 in the second half, compared to just 3-6 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Up three with three minutes remaining, Hawaii went to its star in senior forward Kamilah Jackson. Despite a quiet night due to foul trouble early, she stepped up in critical moments, scoring six straight points for the Rainbow Wahine to give her team a three point lead with under a minute to go. Jackson finished with 14 points in 18 minutes.</p>\n<p>“We were playing a three-two trap and we kept opening up the inside,” Mitchell said. “We had to cut to that low block because that’s where she wants to work, so I’ll have to look at and see if it was our weak side guard not dropping down for a rebound or if it was our back line not full fronting her.”</p>\n<p>Twice in the final minute, freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe drove into the lane and converted a lay-up to bring her team within one.</p>\n<p>However, at 61-60 with 18 seconds left on the clock, UCSB tried for the steal rather than fouling right away. Hawaii ran the clock down to just seven seconds, which gave the Gauchos little time to get down the court to get a decent three point look after the Rainbow Wahine sunk both free throws.</p>\n<p>“We knew going into the game they weren’t really playing with a true point guard, so we were trying to get them off-balance (by trapping), trying to get them to force turnovers and speed them up a bit,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t get a three point shot off as Hawaii took the foul to ensure Santa Barbara would have no opportunity to tie the game and the Gauchos lost their fourth consecutive game.</p>\n<p>While Hawaii’s big lineup proved a tough match-up for UCSB, one matchup that worked well for the Gauchos was senior guard Melissa Zornig, who was guarded by senior guard Sydney Haydel. Santa Barbara went through and to Zornig all night and she finished with a team-high 16 points.</p>\n<p>“They were all power forwards, so they had the mismatch on us, but Coach Mitch told us before the game that that means [we have] mismatches too,” Zornig said. “I’ve just been trying to focus on staying relaxed and not focusing on my shot.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit also added 13 points and four assists while Jemerigbe tallied 10 points. While not in double-figures Mason was critical, scoring nine points and grabbing a career-high four steals.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a bye Saturday and then will return to action next Thursday when it hosts Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-drop-fourth-consecutive-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-drop-fourth-consecutive-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-drop-fourth-consecutive-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-drop-fourth-consecutive-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-drop-fourth-consecutive-game/","id":564,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[563,562,561],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
