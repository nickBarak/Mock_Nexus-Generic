While I have sincere respect for professor Williams’ talent and passion for teaching, I have to disagree with his editorial.</p>\n<p>Many people see voting as a civic duty and feel that it does not matter who you decide to vote for, as long as you participate in our nation’s democracy.

Voting is a process that requires the voter to identify their values, read into both sides of the issues and make a decision that best supports those values. This process may require time, research and serious critical thinking, which can be time consuming and frustrating.</p>\n<p>Consider Prop 23: If approved, it will repeal the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) until the state unemployment rate is at 5.5 percent or lower. Those who vote no on this proposition most likely believe that global warming and the destruction of the environment are some of the biggest problems that California is facing, and to vote yes on this proposition threatens the environment and damages the future of a “green economy.” The other side sees California’s unemployment rate (12.8 percent) as the biggest problem in our state. </p>\n<p>Those who vote yes on Prop 23 probably believe that the continuation of AB 32 will burden all businesses, both large and small, with too many state regulations that make wealth and job creation impossible. This proposition allows the voter a clear choice in priorities: Is our ultimate concern to preserve the environment or to get Californians back to work?</p>\n<p>Voters should apply this thought process when considering all the propositions and candidates for office. If you have made the critical decisions about which candidates and propositions best match your values, than I hope to see you at the ballots on Nov. 2. But there is nothing good about voting just to vote. If you feel that taking such careful consideration is a waste of your time, I ask that you please consider it your civic duty to stay home. Making decisions without taking into serious consideration both sides of the major issues our state is facing is really unfair to those who do care about the election and have carefully developed their own system of values.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27209\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/uninformed-voting-imperils-civic-virtue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27209\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/uninformed-voting-imperils-civic-virtue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/uninformed-voting-imperils-civic-virtue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/uninformed-voting-imperils-civic-virtue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/uninformed-voting-imperils-civic-virtue/","id":5966,"author":{"id":581,"name":"Zachary Ober"},"related":[5965,5964,5963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":581,"name":"Zachary Ober","biography":"Not available","articles":[5966],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Cyberspace Classrooms and E-Professors: One Laptop Learner Considers the Merits and Downfalls of Online Classes","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB has recently begun to experiment with teaching online classes.

Many parts of the traditional face-to-face lecture class work well online, but some do not. Knowing the difference between when the web works and when it doesn’t is the only way the university can teach online classes without eroding the quality of education.</p>\n<p>One place the web shines is in its replacement of the traditional lecture. Lectures are often one-way, with the professor disseminating information to the students. There is no reason this information broadcasting can’t be moved online. Some on-campus professors make their classes interactive by inserting questions to check the student’s understanding, often with i&gt;Clickers. This can be done online as well. I took a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), a course delivered simultaneously to tens of thousands of students from the University of Michigan, and in this class, most of the lectures had integrated multiple-choice questions into the lesson. Because the web can replace the traditional lecture, courses like MOOCs are made possible. It also allows lectures from the best speakers to be disseminated widely.</p>\n<p>The online lecture format is different from the traditional lecture format and has some unique requirements. It is very important that online lectures are videos. There is much more to a lecture than a professor’s words or even the sound of his/her voice; body language conveys a lot, and movement of any sort (be it a video of the professor or video of a whiteboard) lends visual interest and helps keep the students engaged. Also, with the number of distractions available on the computer, it is very easy to lose interest in the class without ever intending to. To these ends, lectures need to be broken up into separate chunks timed at less than 20 minutes each that build on each other, with each containing a single big idea.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the wonderful things about online classes is that they are easy to fit into a busy schedule. It’s OK to stop after any video and return later. Formatting the class this way allows people not only to fit the videos into their schedules but also allows people to easily find the video on a specific topic if they wish to review it later.</p>\n<p>So the lecture is easily moved online. That’s great! But there is a lot more to a university class than the lecture. One of the goals of a university, and especially a research university like UCSB, is to create a community of scholars. This requires not only interaction between the students and the instructors but also unstructured time between professors and students in which they can ask questions too esoteric or off-topic for a general class discussion. Theoretically, this could be done online, but I have yet to find a more productive way to communicate with faculty than meeting in person. Many online classes have discussion forums, but these have a disadvantage because there is a significant time lag in posing a question, receiving a response, posing a follow-on question and so on. Real-time electronic communication technologies could potentially change this, but, as Jane Jacobs observed in 1957, “person-to-person (even with video added) is no substitute for face-to-face.” This is still true today.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy understands this very well. They are promoting a model in which video lectures occur online, and students do exercises in class where they can receive help from their instructors. This “flipped classroom” approach takes full advantage of the strengths of the web to disseminate information without losing the critical person-to-person aspect of education.</p>\n<p>I took Geography 12: Maps and Spatial Reasoning online at UCSB in the fall. The class was well-done. The instructor as well as the TAs had open office hours each week. There was also an on-campus section. Many of the activities in section could have been moved online, but this is something that must be decided on a class-by-class basis.</p>\n<p>In general, online classes need to be made up of engaging videos to replace the traditional lecture, and we must remember that there is more to a university class than the lecture. We need to address all these things in order to perpetuate the mission of creating a community of scholars. Otherwise, we are shorting both the students and the university.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Conway is a third-year geography major.

Every CC, CSU, and UC has had their own slate of issues laid down and divided by the state’s board of education. Most of us are familiar with the UC’s plight of regental reform, tax hikes, and shrinking of financial aid vouchers. However, looking at the broader picture of issues staring down at the CSU and CC calls to question how some issues may be shared. Proposition 30, being the partial bandage of the entire California higher-education system was aimed to be shared among the three separate bodies.</p>\n<p>CSU’s focused these funds on increasing technology usage, enhancing outreach programs, and stopping unwanted tuition spikes. With the Prop 30 awarding a safety net of $125 million to the Cal State budget, students will be temporarily refunded by tuition waivers. However, the Cal State system will not be able to avoid making faculty and administration cuts to further balance their budget. CC’s are battling with class overflow, availability, faculty ratio, and a recently introduced course drop fee.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The resemblance of budgetary reform and fiscal responsibility among state legislators has been called to question numerous times. Student advocates have marched together and have called out the state on many occasions. Yet, apart from the “March in March,” there has not been collaboration in any organized fashion to help represent the three tiers of education in our state. This call to question has been recognized but no formal action has been taken until last year. I am a transfer student from both a CC and Four Year Institution. I have felt first-hand the dissemblance and fracture of the CA students on the ground level. I decided to bring this to the UCSA’s attention and pitch it as a formal endorsable resolution at the summer conference in 2012. It turned out that a few of my colleagues at UCR and UCLA had the exact same idea. After discussing the idea further, we decided to create a formal union of college students similar to the structure of the UCSA. However, this new organization would involve student leaders from all tiers of education in CA. We got the idea at the conference to title the organization (C.A.U.C.U.S.), which stands for the California Union of College and University Students. This union would call representatives from each assembly district to send a student leader from that region. Since there are more CC’s and CSU’s than UC’s the organization is going to extend to every region that may not include UC’s. In addition to these representatives, there are special delegate liaison from the SSCCC, CSSA, and UCSA. With a diverse and widespread board of representatives tackling issues of commonality can be objective to the needs of all students in the CA education system.</p>\n<p>After speaking with Senator Jackson, Assemblyman Williams, and many other representative allies we have a solid “YES,” to continue building this CA Student Union. At this point we are looking for feedback, advocates, and motivators to help make this idea into reality. I am pretty curious as to what my fellow Gauchos think about this, (as we are the most spirited campus that drives the UC.) Regardless of how long this takes I promise that this will happen. There is always a better chance to fight for what students believe in when we stand together. The choice is ours….</p>\n<p>STAND UNITED OR FALL DIVIDED!</p>\n<p><em>Sam Swift is a third-year political science and acting double major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at<em> dailynexus.com</em> on April 5, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50697\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50697\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/new-caucus-group-focuses-on-unity-between-uccsucc-students-aims-for-empowerment/","id":5964,"author":{"id":487,"name":"Sam Swift"},"related":[5963,5962,5961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dirty, Oily Money Students Voice Concerns Over Regents’ Environmentally Un-Savvy Investments","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Currently, the UC Board of Regents has hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the fossil fuel industry.

At the UC level, we have much to be proud of as well:</p>\n<p>According to the UC Sustainability Reports, as of 2012 the UC campuses could produce over 17 megawatts of onsite renewable power — wow! Plus, the UC has the most LEED (green building) certifications of any university in the U.S. It is great that our university is making huge ecological improvements. But how can the UC claim to be a leader in sustainable business when it buys stock in fossil fuel companies?</p>\n<p>From their extraction to their combustion, fossil fuels are an energy source brimming with pollution. As most of us already know, coal burning causes acid rain, oil spills poison our rivers and “fracking” rock to extract natural gas requires huge volumes of chemical-laden water. Moreover, fossil fuel combustion is contributing to global climate change by increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>It is likely a fiscally-smart investment to own stock in the lucrative fossil fuel industry, but because fossil fuel combustion produces carbon dioxide, this is an investment in favor of global climate change, and climate change is truly a “risky business.”</p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization, global climate change is causing rising sea levels, melting glaciers, changing precipitation patterns and more frequent and intense weather patterns. These alterations to the planet, which are effects of global climate change, compromise our safety and that of future generations. For example, changing precipitation patterns mean that we are experiencing increasingly frequent and intense floods which drown people, destroy homes and create breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Climate change therefore reduces the ability of future generations to meet their needs.</p>\n<p>Obviously, climate change is not something in which an aspiring sustainable institution should be invested. Burning fossil fuels is a cause of global climate change, so it is equally inappropriate for the sustainability-oriented UC to own stock in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>UC Students have the power to change the Regents’ investments. Today, we need to pressure our Regents to uphold the UC-wide mission of sustainability by demanding that they divest from the fossil fuel industry. It’s time to take action. Attend an Environmental Affairs Board meeting (Wednesdays, 7 p.m. in the MCC) to get started!</p>\n<p><em>Risa Jensen is an undeclared first-year.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/dirty-oily-money-students-voice-concerns-over-regents-environmentally-un-savvy-investments/","id":5965,"author":{"id":482,"name":"Risa Jensen"},"related":[5964,5963,5962],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
