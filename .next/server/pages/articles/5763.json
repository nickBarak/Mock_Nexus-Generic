","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “Millennial.” I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “young woman in my 20s following a popular trend.” Put simply, I am voting for Bernie Sanders because I am educated. Now, I am not quite caught up on nuclear physics, and I would probably struggle a bit on any given biology exam (props to you, science majors … y’all the real MVPs), but I am also not the type to undervalue my political science degree and minor in women, development and culture as an “easy ride through the social sciences on my path to an MRS degree” (I can ramble on about that bullsh** stereotype for days, but I’m excited you’re still even reading this, so I will abstain from my desire to digress). </p>\n<blockquote><p>We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Admittedly, I haven’t always been interested in politics. In fact, I got into UCSB as an econ major and was weeded out by the econ majors that were indeed supposed to be there (as well as the ones that wisely chose not to thoroughly damage their livers the first quarter of freshman year). It wasn’t until my third year that a sociology course — later to become the foundation for my minor — allowed me to look at the bigger picture. I studied women, poverty and exploitation in the third world and was forced to take a hard look at the institutions that perpetuate injustices in these areas. We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass. As it turns out, however, the sources of this evil lie far closer to our realm of familiarity and influence than we realize, protected by a powerful system that we have underestimated and hidden behind a sensationalist media that has underestimated us. I was able to gain a global perspective that considered the genuine suffering of human lives — lives we often denigrate to nothing more than a statistic — and recognized the role politics had played in causing this suffering. The same politics that we get bored of and ignored. The politics that have — due to our lack of attention — fallen into the wrong hands and subsequently the wrong pockets. The United States has historically been the most powerful country in the world, so when we allow multi-billion dollar corporations to buy politicians and thus the votes that deregulate their activity, the repercussions of that are felt all over the world. </p>\n<blockquote><p> Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bernie Sanders is not making history because he is a viral trend amongst young idealists; his popularity has spiked because he has given people faith that we can create a politics that cares about people. He has created a movement that has brought people together from both the left and the right who can all agree that our political system is rigged. Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen. He has shown through record-breaking turnouts and individual contributions that the American people can regain control of our political process. We can no longer accept the narrative that politics are only for politicians. We can no longer fulfill the stereotype that young, educated Americans are more passionate about who wins “The Bachelor” than which American corporations profit from labor exploitation and human rights abuses around the world.  It is not just our duty to our country, but our responsibility to the global community to be politically active citizens who acknowledge that we indeed have the power to change the world.</p><div

elephant (spider?) in the room (not in the room?)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venom is heralded as one of Spider-Man’s greatest foes, and Spider-Man is directly involved in Venom’s comic book origin story. The question is, can Venom hold his own movie without his better third? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venom has Spider-Man’s eyes. Venom has powers that are mostly Spider-Man’s. I mean, come on! In Venom’s appearances in comic books, animated movie and other forms of media, he has a spider symbol on his chest just like Spider-Man! The answer to the question is a remarkably solid yes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the bigger question is how the hell did director Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland”) manage to make a pretty decent movie?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent any confusion, I will avoid making any comparisons to the comic book source material. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s probably best to start from the beginning of the film, during which we’re introduced to a space shuttle crashing from the depths of the cosmos, carrying astronauts and, more notably, slimy aliens known as “symbiotes.” These symbiotes bond to other organisms by submerging their liquid bodies into the host, typically gaining full control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why bond to other organisms? Shockingly enough, these aliens can’t survive in a foreign, oxygen-rich environment like Earth. Unfortunately, symbiotes can’t just bond to any organism à la blood types and organ transplants; they need to find an exact match, or the host will die within minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our reluctant hero, journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), just so happens to be an exact match. Hardy delivers an immersive experience both as Eddie Brock and Venom and also voices the titular symbiote/symbiote-human pairing. The film delves into several inconsistently paced and edited themes. At times the film is portrayed as a horror film, as a thriller and, perhaps most frequently, as an action film. Despite the sometimes inconsistent editing of the film’s themes, Hardy manifests these themes and immerses the audience in them exceptionally well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s antagonist, CEO of the Life Foundation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), sees a world “on the brink of collapse” and wants to use these symbiotes to forcibly evolve humanity. Though his goal is somewhat noble, Drake leaves behind no moral ambiguity, considering human beings as “disposable” and willingly subjecting humans to disturbing deaths as he tries to find the key to achieving his goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigating the Life Foundation, the Venom symbiote bonds with Brock. Brock, while attempting to manage his “guest,”  is hunted down by Drake’s men as he simultaneously assesses what the symbiote is doing to him with the help of his former girlfriend, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams). As the symbiote and Brock bond physically and socially, Drake bonds with another symbiote, Riot. Brock and Venom seek to stop Drake and Riot, who set out to obtain millions of symbiotes so that Riot may take over the Earth and Drake may evolve humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fight between Venom and Riot breaks out, featuring excellent cinematography, choreography and, above all, superb special effects, all of which can be seen previously in the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, there are some editing and pacing issues (sometimes creating logic holes in the film), as well as a lack of character development, but these issues are ultimately overshadowed by Tom Hardy’s stellar performance, general direction of the film, spectacular effects, choreography and cinematography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don’t particularly enjoy the film, I’d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recommend staying for the scene during the closing credits.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-30/tom-hardy-delivers-stellar-performance-in-venom/","id":5760,"author":{"id":52,"name":"Manuel Carlos"},"related":[5759,5758,5757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Statement From Inter-Fraternity Council President Regarding Allegations of Bribery in A.S.

This includes the recent Associated Students Elections. In order to encourage our members to perform their civic responsibility as students, IFC offered grants to chapters that achieved high voter turnout, which the chapter is required to use towards their philanthropic purposes. The IFC viewed this as a way to further two of its core principles- student participation and philanthropy in the local community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IFC has been unequivocally transparent about these grants. When it was brought to our attention that Associated Students Election Board was investigating the grants, the IFC issued a formal letter to Elections Board to dispel any rumors or misinformation that they may have received. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IFC felt comfortable doing so because we know that we have not broken any rules or regulations. There is absolutely no clause in Associated Students Legal Code that prohibits such programs. Nor is there any such clause in Office of Student Life (OSL) Statement of Regulations, which every campus organization is required to follow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IFC did not develop this program without consultation from our advisor who also serves as the Director of OSL. He recalled that many other UCSB campus organizations have used similar programs to incentivize voter turnout in AS elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many other administrative staff, who have extensive knowledge of AS Legal Code and the OSL Statement of Regulations, are well aware of the grant and have absolutely no concerns about it being a violation of existing policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Inter-Fraternity Council will not engage with people who call our organization’s integrity into question. Again, my only hope from this statement is that the students hear the truth and are able to see that the Inter-Fraternity Council has not broken any rules, nor is it afraid to be 100 percent transparent and truthful about what has transpired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, I will be attending AS Senate meeting tonight at 6:30 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion, so that Senate can hear the truth and the facts, rather than the rumors and misconceptions that have been spread around campus over the past 24 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sincerely,</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brendan D.

Across the UC system and here at UCSB, the university’s insufficient support for student mental health services makes this far from a reality. According to the American College Health Association, 30 percent of college students report being too depressed to function. One in five college students will be diagnosed with depression during their undergraduate career. For the past three years, the number of new students seen by UCSB’s Counseling And Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has increased by an average of 26 percent. While C.A.P.S. has expanded and continues to support an increasing number of students, the amount of funding provided to our mental health services at UCSB does not meet the needs of our student body. This disconnect between C.A.P.S.’s needs and its capacity has been damaging.<br>\nStudents have expressed dissatisfaction in the wait times for appointments. Clinicians are not provided adequate space and room accommodations. In a setting where we want to promote racial and gender equity, our counseling staff does not adequately reflect the diversity of our student body. Furthermore, the culture of our campus is not yet one that entirely fosters mental health.<br>\n“#HowAreYou: A Call to Reform Student Mental Health Services” is a UC Student Association (UCSA) campaign working to improve the accessibility, diversity and outreach in mental health services at each UC. UCSA has created an expansive rubric in order to grade mental health services on each campus. The rubric measures certain aspects of our counseling services, such as wait times, the trend in intake appointments, the diversity of clinicians, Full Time Equivalent (FTE)-to-student ratio, etc. in order to diagnose areas in which C.A.P.S. can improve. As a result of this study, UCSA awarded UCSB’s C.A.P.S. a grade of C+.<br>\nThis grade is not to criticize C.A.P.S. or C.A.P.S. Staff, who have worked innovatively to improve services with the limited resources they have, but rather to bring to light the damage that comes when such vital student resources are allowed to be under resourced. We hope that this serves as a call to action, both for the community to be more aware of the services and its necessary changes and for UCSB administration to do more about improving this vital service on campus.<br>\nUCSB’s C.A.P.S. excels as they allow students to be seen the same day that they come and express they need help. Other campuses have same day appointments, but only for students exhibiting signs of crisis, and some have no kinds of same day appointments at all. These walk-in appointments are a unique innovation — started at UCSB — that maximize the potential of our clinical staff while also setting our campus up to be one that provides resources on a needs basis. However, this does not support students who require long-term care, because follow-up appointments must still be scheduled weeks in advance.<br>\nUCSB also leads in counseling services, compared to the other UCs, with our mental health peer program, in which students work with C.A.P.S. to provide resources to others in need. C.A.P.S. has excelled in preventing suicide with our #SaySomething campaign, and has made great strides in supporting our black students in response to a series of demands made by the Black Student Union in 2013.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68781\" style=\"width: 593px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68781\" data-attachment-id=\"68781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/ucsb-caps-2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"594,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB CAPS 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?fit=594%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2-250x161.png?resize=583%2C376\" alt=\"Image courtesy of UCSA\" width=\"583\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UCSB-CAPS-2.png?w=594&amp;ssl=1 594w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of UCSA</p></div>\n<p>These are the things that we must do to ensure that students will receive adequate mental health services:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The hiring of more diverse and culturally competent clinicians:</strong></p>\n<p>National trends indicate that people of color use mental health services at a lower rate than their white counterparts. African Americans and Chican@/Latin@ Americans used mental health services at about one half the rate of Caucasian Americans in the past year. In the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) community, that rate shrank to one third. Studies have shown that matching the race and sex of the therapist to that of the client increases the acceptability and effectiveness of treatment services. As a Hispanic Serving Institution, UCSB should not be this drastically lacking Hispanic serving clinicians. Thus, the hiring of API, Chican@/Latin@, South Asian, Middle Eastern and North African serving clinicians is a must.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The expansion and improvement of the C.A.P.S. building:</strong></p>\n<p>Accessibility and comfort are necessary for fostering an environment that supports mental health. Our current facility is struggling for space. With a new state of the art facility at UCSB, students will be able to receive care with more comfort and convenience. Climate controlled, spacious and confidential spaces have proven to help students in therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The integration of mental health services in academic and student life:</strong></p>\n<p>Placing a therapist in the residence halls provides more benefits than just the ease in accessibility. When therapists are in the residence halls, it contributes to an environment in which the residents understand that support is around them and accessible to them when they need it. For this reason, therapists should be placed wherever there is a high density of students, including residence halls, university apartments and areas on campus where stigma around mental health can be greater, like the S.T.E.M. buildings.<br>\nThe university should be a place where students thrive, not just endure. The changes we are calling for will allow us to address long wait times and short staffing and can create an environment on campus where we can truly care for all of us, especially those populations that are most vulnerable. This past summer, a group of UC students who were tired of week-long waiting times for their friends, frustrated with C.A.P.S. centers that didn’t have therapists that came from their communities and who believed deeply in the need to create a culture of compassion launched the #HowAreYou campaign. As students, we made improving our mental health services our priority; it’s time our administration did the same.</p>\n<p>Signed,<br>\nSiavash Zohoori, Mental Health Coordinator<br>\nLillian Cain, Policy Analyst<br>\nMohsin Mirza, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs<br>\nAnumita Kaur, Campus Organizing Director</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/caps-c-grade-needs-improvement-investment/","id":5762,"author":{"id":402,"name":"Siavash Zohoori"},"related":[5761,5760,5759],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
