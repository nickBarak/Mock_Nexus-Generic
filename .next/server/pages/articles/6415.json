We hate it, we really do. But we’d never tell you that. In fact, we spend our entire Super Bowl Sunday attempting to show you how much we like totes magotes know about football. This is the one day a year that guys can get their revenge for girls constantly dragging them to rom-coms (sometimes even minus the com) and ballets, and how do we thank them? By overly pretending to care about football … but ya know, in that cute, slutty, endearing way.</p>\n<p>Because we’re not about to drop $50 on a jersey, we shamelessly pull out any football attire we have, of any size, and wear it … as a dress. The next thing you know we’re buying squares and cheering at all of the wrong times. We are committed as hell to impressing you, but it always backfires. The casual comments we think make us look super smart and engaged actually are incredibly wrong.</p>\n<p>“I’m rooting for Peyton Manning. For sure. He’s my fave. Tom Brady is so sexy, and he just doesn’t ever get helmet hair somehow, but he’s married to Gisele, and I hear she’s a bitch.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Well, with you on the Tom Brady thing, but it’s Eli Manning. Read a book about the Manning family, my friend. Read. A. Book.</p>\n<p>The girls are only in it for the halftime show, really. And to take a keg stand or two (don’t try to be a hero), so that we can casually stick around for three hours after the game ends. Hey, that keg won’t finish itself. Of course, when the halftime show actually comes, every guy immediately bolts out the door (brbsnappa!) … which allows the girls to finally have their moment and eat a Buffalo wing in peace without having to worry about looking like a primitive savage. And let’s be honest, all this show did was remind me how much Madonna sucks. Then throw in the wild card of Cee Lo coming out wearing a jazzed-up rain tarp … just why? I would have gladly jumped up there and lip-synced to “Vogue.” Too bad Madonna’s 53 and somehow manages to look younger than me. Luckily, the real halftime show coincided with the kitty halftime show of the Puppy Bowl, which was far more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>The one and only time I perked up was when they actually did cut to Gisele in the audience. Because let’s be real, if I wanted to watch a bunch of fat men running around in tights, I’d just go to an American Apparel in Houston. But of course I had to do my duty and cheer on Tom Brady, because the chances of me being able to name any other guy out on that field are about as close to the chances of me giving up alcohol for Lent. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>\n<p>Speaking of alcohol, the Super Bowl turns classy ladies into self-proclaimed frat stars. Keg stands? Gargoyles? Shotgunning? Bring it. By the end of the first half I’m pretty sure I was opening bottles with my forearm. God no, that was a boldfaced lie. Could you imagine? But thanks to midday mass alcoholic consumption, it was kind of difficult to get on board with looking sexy when the Super Bowl ended. “No, no, my eyes always look like this, I’m not even that drunk. Not even that drunk.”</p>\n<p>The one good thing about the Super Bowl is that everyone can bond over the commercials. Except for when Adriana Lima came on for the Victoria’s Secret Valentine’s Day commercial and every guy in the room had to maneuver their seating arrangement to conceal a half-master. Same result anywhere you go after that commercial comes on. The girls in the room start debating whether or not her boobs are real, and the guys are sitting there in awe, shaking their heads, saying, “Doesn’t matter. Does not matter.”</p>\n<p>Well, to be real, the Super Bowl wasn’t all that bad. The last 10 minutes were intense. I’m talking in tents. It almost made me want to learn the rules of the game. When the Giants finally sealed their win, it all of a sudden was déjà vu back to New Year’s. Screaming, yelling, bottles opening. It was out of control. Giants couples everywhere were most likely making out euphorically, and Patriot pair-ups were consoling each other with love. The Super Bowl can really bring people together, and look at that, just in time for V-Day. Regardless of if your team won, or however much money you painfully lost, there was still plenty of room to come out of the day with a W. Well, maybe not entirely … now, I need to go donate all of my New England Patriots 2012 Champions gear to the nearest Goodwill …</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks doesn’t mean to generalize. Not all girls hate watching the Super Bowl. However, all of them would prefer to be doing The Titanic.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Ana Murray” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"423182063\" data-slb-group=\"44415\"><img data-attachment-id=\"44416\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/am-superbowlhump-2-8-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=2552%2C2001&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2552,2001\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=250%2C196&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=888%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-44416\" title=\"AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12-250x196.jpg?resize=250%2C196\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?resize=250%2C196&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C803&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/","id":6415,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6414,6413,6412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks","biography":"Not available","articles":[6391,6392,6415,6417,6418,6420,6421,6422,6425,6426,6427,6428,6429],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Students Speak Out On Toxic Masculinity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masc-miguel-e1558593641781.png?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB students open up about their experiences with toxic masculinity.

In addition to being three of the most pressing issues our nation is currently facing, each is partially derived from and interconnected with toxic masculinity. <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/01/25/origins-of-toxic-masculinity/\">Coined in 2005</a>, the term refers to harmful beliefs and behaviors that constitute society’s expectations of manhood.

The 2014 Isla Vista shooting sparked a national conversation about the damaging impact of traditional notions of masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of continuing this dialogue, we asked students to share their experiences with toxic masculinity. As these vignettes represent but a fraction of the whole, we encourage readers to share their own stories with one another.

If you get hit on the soccer field, you better hit the other player back even harder. If someone makes you feel vulnerable, never give them the power of letting them see it. If your “opponent” in any contentious interaction shows vulnerability, you’ve already won. Toxic masculinity at its finest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I prided myself on being “one of the good guys” growing up, I still remained committed to never letting my somber emotions get the best of me. In my eyes, one of the worst things that could happen to me socially was to have my traditional definition of masculinity questioned by my peers. Not being a complete hot-headed asshole like some of my peers had already garnered enough pestering questions and insults. I was not going to concede any more vulnerability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This worked for a good 19 years. However, it was just not sustainable. I never truly opened up to family and friends. I barely acknowledged the emotions of the girls I was involved with. I goofed around and took serious situations, frankly, not seriously enough. Overall, I pretended I was perfectly fine and in control of my life. As an assortment of family, social and other issues started to pile up, it quickly became apparent that I was not going to last this way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter of my freshman year of college was when I finally broke. I remember getting off the phone with my parents and beginning to sense this growing discomfort in my chest. Soon, I was lying on the floor of my dorm, panic attack in full effect, taking big gasps of air, heart racing and wondering whether I was about to have a heart attack, my composed facade in shambles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what my first concern was as I laid in my bed recovering my breath, 20 minutes later?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m so glad nobody saw me like that.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Kian Karamdashti</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a young age, I was surrounded by toxic ideas about what it means to be a man. As an athlete, I was taught a lot of lessons on the field that translated to other contexts as well. Men are supposed to be aggressive; we’re supposed to take what we want, and under no circumstances should we show vulnerability or pain. I was (incorrectly) told that men are fundamentally and biologically different from women in both our desires and our behavior, and that this rationalized most of the violence we enacted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily for me, I had so many strong and compassionate women in my family that I never truly internalized these beliefs. I was basically raised in a matriarchy, and I knew from a young age that there was certainly no leadership role or job that a man can do that a woman can’t do (and most likely do better). My passion for anthropology inspired me to research and discover that most of what we think about sex and gender is actually not true, and that outdated stereotypes surrounding gender roles are based on patriarchal ideologies far more than on scientific fact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it took a lot of labor and arbitrary situations for me to become de-socialized and to grow up valuing empathy and vulnerability over traits we would consider more “masculine.” It shouldn’t be up to women to teach us this. Cisgender men created these toxic notions of masculinity, and it’s up to us to dismantle them. Recent events like mass shootings and the well-documented disparity in domestic violence perpetrated by men compared to women show that we have an issue with young men growing up entitled, ignorant, abrasive, and de-sensitized. It’s so easy in this day and age for men to dehumanize and demonize women personally or through social media, and it’s just not right. We must change ourselves in order to create the world that all women deserve.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Omar Hernandez</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic masculinity, in my (ill-informed) opinion, is a Rolodex of traits that every man shouldn’t emulate. Regardless of your standing knowledge of the word, it feels as if it is always within earshot. A buzzword, really. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I’ve known about toxic masculinity since high school, its relevance did not emerge until I moved to college — at the other end of the nation. My personal opinions are not matter-of-fact, but I do believe the atmosphere at UC Santa Barbara takes this phrase more seriously than in Buffalo, my hometown. And this makes sense — Southern California is a melting pot for social justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, toxic masculinity isn’t a term that I would use, ever. Its scope is too large, like shielding a pebble from the rain with an umbrella. Telling someone or saying that something is of toxic masculinity helps nobody; that’s stating the obvious. If you really want to make a difference, assess the issue individually, use more precise descriptions and identify the specific root of those actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I do believe that men throughout the world should be held accountable for their actions, the use of this label ultimately highlights the actions of the lower denominations in male society and presents a skewed image of males as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn’t fair. Take your “men ain’t shit” tweets somewhere else. For every asshole out there, another man is working just as hard to support himself and potentially a significant other and family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get lazy and paint the entire picture with just one color: generalizing the actions of men is unjust!</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Max Abrams</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion of toxic masculinity is one that cannot wait — men need to do their part. When one adheres and conforms to the traditional constructions of what manhood is, the consequences can have hegemonic and dangerous implications for oneself and others. These constructions of masculinity are, unfortunately, imposed upon and expected of boys beginning in childhood. Equally unfortunate are the consequences for those who do not act according to a specific template of gendered norms, which historically have been characterized by dominance, assertiveness and self-reliance. These behaviors can lead to more dangerous outcomes, such as misogyny, homophobia or violence. If a man does not adhere to these behaviors, it can lead to exclusion and ridicule from others, further perpetuating the behaviors in a cycle of desired sociocultural validation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By addressing toxic masculinity, we can work to dismantle the harmful behaviors that have been essentialized to construct what constitutes a “man.” Fighting these destructive norms does not subtract from “manhood,” but, rather, subverts repressive notions of gender and upholds fundamental tenets of how one should treat others.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have always had an effeminate voice, though I have not always known it.

I’m short and fat, with fingers that resemble sausages. I’m not into sports, I’ve never been a fan of cars and I think beer tastes like wet bread. I’ve been told many times that I’m not a man because of these facts and I’ve been ridiculed because I’m not six-foot-plus with rippling muscles and a deep voice. It hurts, especially during the chaotic swirl that was high school. Feeling like I wasn’t what I was supposed to be and that I couldn’t do anything about it shredded my self-esteem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe to them I wasn’t a man. I am, however, a woodworker and a blacksmith. A lumberjack and a powerlifter. I can fix any problem that comes up in your house and I can build a house from the ground up. I bring smiles to the people around me and support to my loved ones. I can cook one hell of a dinner, I clean a house damn well and I know how to ask for help when I need it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic masculinity showed me what I wasn’t and tried to shame me for it. Instead, I turned around and found what real men are made of.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Miguel Rodriguez</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My life, from childhood to the present, has been rooted in ever-changing ideologies of masculinity. My upbringing was consistent with typical ideas of what it means to be a “man.” Lessons from my dad, an individual heavily indoctrinated with a hegemonic understanding of masculinity, served as an introduction. While he craved hunting trips and sports, I craved wearing dresses, carefully braiding my mom’s hair on days when he was absent. The years passed by, and as my voice grew deeper, my face hairier and my body larger, I felt myself internalizing his ideals and expectations, unaware of their impact. I became less empathetic and my words and actions danced with destruction. Not only had I absorbed my dad’s ideals, rooted in toxic masculinity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I embodied them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I grew older my mind became weary, my clandestine relationship with queerness yearning to express itself outwardly. Anxiously, I began distancing myself from my father and the many ideas that I had come to believe. This space allowed for a transformation; the expectations imposed by him melted away as I gained other perspectives. Experiences that broke down gender dichotomies and heteronormativity provided understandings previously concealed by my upbringing. The self-hatred I’d harbored due to masculine ideals no longer dictated my behavior. I embraced my desire to cross boundaries — painting my nails the color of the sky, holding hands with boys without fear of ridicule, chasing desires I’d stored in a closet somewhere 300 miles away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I get older, my growth is no longer controlled by traditional notions of masculinity. The walls that my father, and countless other men in my life, aided me in building have lost their height and sturdiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had to become gentler with myself and my emotions, with the emotions of others, with the words that men often produce without understanding the impact they have on others. I’ve begun to accept my mind’s fragility and how it influences my interactions with the earth and those that exist upon it. As I become aware of my errors, I feel the need for myself and all men to be constantly aware of the pain they may cause to others, as well as the pain they may cause to themselves.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Dallin Mello</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masculinity is an interesting concept we have the opportunity to observe in today’s cosmopolitan social sphere. It’s important to acknowledge that masculinity, while sometimes toxic, annoying and inconsiderate, can also be a beautiful thing. I believe that masculinity, or typical male behavior, is something that takes a long time to master. As a college-aged student, I recognize that I still have a lot to learn. To complicate things, our society is learning with us. Growing up, masculinity meant being a gentleman: holding doors open for ladies (and sometimes men), being tough and striving for success. But as I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that, like most things, masculinity is a balance. The beautiful thing about masculinity today is that you can paint your nails, talk about your feelings and still get laid. Masculinity is what you make of it. So please don’t make it toxic. You do you, however masculine you are. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Anonymous</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting in my living room with cis boys for too many days in a row is enough to make me want to curl up on my bed and not talk to anyone.

Every time I opened my laptop my stress levels rose, yet I couldn’t let them go — I couldn’t make myself close them. Each tab was a voice telling me that I needed to finish an assignment, apply for a job, check my email or figure out the bus schedule. My mind was constantly stimulated, and I lacked the time to enjoy what was in front of me because I was too focused on checking off boxes on my overcrowded to-do list.

I had time to sit and just <em>be</em> in the present moment. I didn’t check my email for days at a time and was rarely absorbed by external pressure and stress. Although this was just a month before, it seemed like a lifetime ago. With all of these newfound realizations and the overwhelming stress of being back in school, I decided I needed to reconnect with the summer version of myself and get to the root of why I, as well as many other college students, felt trapped in a counterproductive cycle.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I needed to take responsibility for my unhealthy, 23-tab mindset. I needed to exit out of everything and start over with myself. My head was full of due dates, ideas and goals — leaving my physical and mental health last on my priority list. I was guilty of spending the whole day constantly thinking and working without giving myself time to process or enjoy the moment. The day would fly by, and suddenly, it was 4:00 p.m. and I hadn’t eaten anything. I’d had spent hours reading, grocery shopping, checking my email and going to class, but hadn’t nourished my body or appreciated the sun shining on my face. Admitting that I wasn’t taking time out of my day for my own physical and mental well-being was the first step toward making a change in my habits.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A question I constantly ask myself is this: In a month or even a week from now, am I still going to care or worry about this minor problem or midterm coming up?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, I had to change my perspective on what really matters in the long run. A question I constantly ask myself is this: In a month or even a week from now, am I still going to care or worry about this minor problem or midterm coming up? Usually the answer is no, because things seem to work out the way they should. Or sometimes, shit just happens, and everything falls apart — but that’s life. You pick up the pieces and you move on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have realized that letting outside factors consume me is a waste of energy and time because things just happen, and we can’t do anything except try our best. The best thing we can do for ourselves is to make sure our mind, body and spirit are in harmony in order to allow ourselves to thrive. If these entities are linked, we can succeed with more ease because our intentions and goals are clear instead of fogged by never-ending to-do lists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the privilege that comes with being stressed about school, internships, jobs and future opportunities must be recognized. To have the ability to worry about what career path I want to choose or what books I need to read is an undeniable privilege that </span><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/unesco-264-million-children-dont-go-to-school/a-41084932\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">millions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people don’t have. A gratuitous amount of people don’t have the opportunity to worry about these things because they can’t afford or don’t have the right to receive an education. When one’s only priority is to make sure their family has something to eat for dinner or to teach their kids how to read because they <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41558486\">lack the right to an </a></span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41558486\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">education</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is hard to justify your own reasons for stressing. This is not to say that a person’s stress about school and life is any less valid just because it is a privileged problem to have — it simply puts things in a different perspective. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admitting that I wasn’t taking time out of my day for my own physical and mental well-being was the first step toward making a change in my habits.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As tiresome and stressful as going to UC Santa Barbara can be at times, I love this school and feel like I am gaining valuable insights and life lessons here. The stereotypical “work hard, play hard” mentality has proven itself true in my experience of making sure I spent the whole day at the library so I could go out with my friends at night. The mix of academic rigor and fun is just as amazing as it is unique. As fairytale-like as this school can sometimes feel with the ocean and mountains at our fingertips, parties every day of the week and top-notch professors, it is important to make sure to take time for yourself and not let stressors like finding an internship or getting an A’s in all your classes consume you. Put things into perspective and try to focus on one thing at a time. Close those tabs and make time for yourself. Whether that is listening to music, taking a walk on the beach, cooking, meditating, getting lunch with a friend or whatever you need to do to destress and enjoy the moment, make sure you fit it into your daily schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you keep your eyes shut to the beautiful things that surround you every day, you will put yourself in a counteractive cycle of always being on the move and never making any time for yourself. Closing your tabs may not be the cure to the stress in your life, but it is the first step toward a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler wants you to close close the tabs on your computer screen and take time to destress from your daily routine.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-16/close-computer-tabs-clear-mind/","id":6413,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[6412,6411,6410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"ZOOMing in on the Effects of Digital Education","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Virtual Reality","publish_date":"2020-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zoom_Uni.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zoom_Uni.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Peter Figueira discusses the potential impacts of the recent switch to online education.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-recorded lectures, an entire educational system at the tips of my fingers and a — Minecraft virtual background?

Although there are many advantages and disadvantages of the digital switch, I found about three of each category that encapsulate the polarity of short-term effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new system allows for maximum flexibility; a student can study anytime and anywhere, such as inside their home obviously, and review recorded lectures as many times as they want. Another advantage is more individual attention and confidence. Have you ever felt like your question might be too dumb to blurt out in front of your peers? Well, since all interactions are now conducted through screens, that fear is much less of a deterrent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, online classes help you meet interesting people. The number of personalities that a single Zoom meeting projects is staggering. I have seen backgrounds that show a favorite Nickelodeon show setting, I have seen pets of all shapes and sizes (one student had a pet parasitic flatworm named Gary), but most importantly, I see you. I see individuals who probably shared a class with me in Phelps or Campbell Hall, and yet I never knew they existed. What were the backs of heads are now the faces of people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, online learning also presents certain challenges. At first, I thought, “How could there be any disadvantage to staying at home and learning when I want to?” Well, believe it or not, online classes require more time than on-campus courses. Since typing can be much slower than speaking, typing out questions for your professor and/or TA might take up more of your time. Also, many students are now reading significantly more than they were during standard class instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another disadvantage is the sense of isolation. I know a handful of people who need to be in a social setting to study, who cannot focus without the subtle whispers in the library or giggles in a study room. Also, there isn’t much external support in an online environment. In a muted Zoom meeting, no one can hear you scream.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the most significant disadvantage of online education from home is procrastination. Procrastination has become a practical skill in the minds of many college students. Despite many working on fixing this bad habit of waiting to start assignments until the final hour, the new online environment makes it doubly challenging to overcome this habit and get stuff done without a set schedule. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What were the backs of heads are now the faces of people.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are mixed reviews related to the change from in-person lectures to online classes. However, the short-term effects are manageable and as time progresses students become more accustomed to the new norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what will happen as lectures linger in the online realm, and students begin to realize that in-person conferences weren’t as necessary as they seemed to be?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could potentially cause an increase in dropout rates. A 2011 </span><a href=\"https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-hybrid-courses-washington.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study from Columbia University’s Community College Research Center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (CCRC) showed that community college students from Washington were more likely to drop from online courses than traditional ones. In fact, the completion rate of conventional classes was 90%, while online classes saw a rate of 82%. Furthermore, the study also showed that students who took online courses were less likely to transfer to another college or complete a degree altogether. By just taking one online class during the fall, the students from the CCRC study were 34% more likely to drop out after a single year, compared to 26% taking traditional courses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just one online class, the chances of dropping out increased by 8%. Can you imagine how an entirely online curriculum will affect the higher educational system?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering all of this, I believe that the greatest effect of the switch to online education will be adjustments to student tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The realization that I can learn the same amount of information from my bed as in a lecture hall makes me wonder if I really need to be paying so much to earn my degree from a prestigious university, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/04/16/college-students-are-rebelling-against-full-tuition-after-classes-move-online/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I’m not the only one</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students across the world have the same concerns about the lack of a tuition adjustment in the wake of the complete change in curriculum.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In a muted Zoom meeting, no one can hear you scream.  </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On its own, the price to attend a UC is gobsmacking compared to a community college. Of course, the large price tag assumes you are receiving an estimable education at one of the top research institutions in the nation. However, nobody is on campus anymore! And we won’t be there anytime soon, as </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2020-04-13-covid-19-update-summer-sessions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Yang has already informed students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that summer courses beginning in June and July will be online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quite frankly, I feel bad for those paying out-of-state tuition; non-residents who are paying over 15 grand to have online classes. No amount of Zoom is worth that much. Something has to be done with the current state of tuition. </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A petition was formed in response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to adjusting the spring 2020 tuition here at UCSB with the hope that Chancellor Yang would take notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving over 6,000 signatures on the petition, and despite having to lock myself indoors, watch Zoom lectures throughout the week and learn from a laptop, the tuition I pay is precisely the same. I genuinely believe that in the long run, students will realize that their experience with online classes was relatively close to learning face to face with a professor and that paying the same price for Zoom lectures at home instead of an actual learning environment (on campus) is inequitable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sooner or later, the changes caused by the online transition will start to mold the fabric of higher education.
