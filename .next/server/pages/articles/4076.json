I.V. is divided into three census tracts, which are subdivisions in each county used in the counting process; I.V.’s three tracts divide the unincorporated district into strips perpendicular to the ocean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has been designated a hard-to-count community. This was before the pandemic,” Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said I.V.’s young population already made gathering census responses in the community challenging. With the pandemic forcing social distancing regulations and</span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the retreat of Santa Barbara Community College and UC Santa Barbara students</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, educating  I.V. residents and conducting typical census outreach has been complicated. If response rates remain low, the community risks losing crucial funding, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether or not people are counted in our community will affect a ton of different government and education-related programs for funding and how much funding Isla Vista and the UCSB area receives,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the census affect a decade’s worth of congressional representation and federal funding in communities, which could go toward projects ranging from infrastructure and highways to school lunches and special education, according to the </span><a href=\"https://2020census.gov/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Census website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normal deadlines and operations in the census project have been extended due to complications from the coronavirus pandemic, and the I.V. CSD is looking for volunteers to start calling households as part of the next phase of the census tracking, according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a similar point in the 2010 U.S. Census, I.V.’s response rate was about 60%, according to the I.V. CSD website. None of the three census tracts in Isla Vista have reached 50% as of May 26, and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“undercount of this magnitude would severely negatively impact Isla Vista’s funding until the year 2030,” according to the I.V. CSD website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”We’re gonna employ every effort that we possibly can to try to get the word out to people,” Brandt said. “The biggest thing that residents can do if they’re concerned about the population is … spread the word to still get counted in Isla Vista [and] don’t get counted at your parents house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite students’ return to their hometowns, the U.S. Census Bureau said students should respond as if they were at their normal place of residence in I.V. Students normally living in on-campus housing are automatically counted in the census through the university. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

It showed I can’t take anything for granted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, Yang finished the 2018 season with a .244 average and — more importantly — a chip on his shoulder heading into the offseason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s belief in his own abilities never faltered; before this season, he stated that one of his goals was to be nominated for the Buster Posey award — given to the top catcher in college baseball. To an outsider, the thought of a recently-benched catcher becoming one of the top catchers in the nation would have seemed absurd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Yang worked at it, tinkering with his swing in the offseason. One day, senior and fellow catcher Thomas Rowan suggested that Yang use his legs more during his swing. Desperate to find anything that worked, Yang gave it a go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, Yang hit two home runs during the team’s scrimmage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of messing with his mechanics, Yang also changed his approach at the plate, inspired in large part by new hitting coach Donegal Fergus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our offensive style is a lot more aggressive this year than it was in the past,” Yang said. “In years past, the staff just wanted us to put the balls in play and not strike out. This year, they want us to hit it in the air and hit home runs. They want us to hit it as hard as we can and not get cheated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change in approach has completely altered the way Yang hits the ball. Last year, Yang grounded out 33 times, with only 39 flyouts. This year, however, he has grounded out 35 times while flying out 62 times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A ground ball does nothing for me, because I’m not fast, so I might as well have my misses in the air,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This significant uptick in fly balls also directly correlates to an increase in power for Yang. After not hitting a single home run last year, Yang has gone deep seven times this season while contributing 45 RBIs. Even when he isn’t going yard, Yang has an uncanny knack for finding the gap, with the backstop tied for the team lead with 16 doubles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most impressively, Yang’s increase in power hasn’t coincided with a decrease in average, with the catcher hitting an eye-popping .383 out of the three-hole for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s contributions to UCSB’s historic season go far beyond just his bat however. This year, Checketts has allowed Yang to start calling games behind the plate, and the junior has rewarded that trust by helping create one of the strongest pitching staffs in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really close to all of the pitchers, and I even live with [Chris] Lincoln and [Jack] Dashwood, and I think we really bring that chemistry to the mound,” Yang said. “Because our pitching staff is so reliable, it allows me to focus more on hitting [instead of] babysitting the pitchers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, Yang has always been above average; this year the catcher sports a sparkling .995 fielding percentage, as well as an impressive 34.5  caught stealing percentage. Despite his numbers, Yang still believes he has room for improvement on the defensive end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve always been able to throw, so that [caught stealing] number is honestly lower than I’d like it to be,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is this drive to be the very best that makes Yang one of the best catchers in the entire country — something that his recent accolades reflect. Last week, Yang accomplished his preseason goal when he was selected as a semifinalist for the Buster Posey award, alongside 13 other catchers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone on that list is a great player, so it was super cool to see my name on there as well,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Just yesterday, as if Yang’s season wasn’t already impressive enough, the veteran backstop was named the 2019 Big West Field Player of the Year, becoming the first Gaucho to win the award since Cameron Newell in 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From getting benched halfway through the season to being named the best field player in the conference, perhaps no player in college baseball has improved as much as Yang.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Behind Yang’s resurgent bat, calming presence and consistent defense, UCSB looks poised to make a deep postseason run. And if Yang can keep up this pace, that run could end in a national title.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6321.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1690333678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88824\"> </a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

game of the entire season — the game that would decide the conference — Boone made Cal Poly’s hitters look foolish all night long. In total, Boone threw eight and one-third innings of shutout baseball, along with a career-high 12 strikeouts. The key ingredient to Boone’s success on Saturday was his changeup, with Boone generating 18 swings and misses on his secondary pitch.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coach talked to me about throwing my changeup to look like a fastball and to keep my arm speed good on my off-speed,” Boone told KCSB’s Max Kelton after the game, when asked about the effectiveness of the pitch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did a freshman pitcher — one who merely throws for average velocity — pitch the game that clinched the Gauchos their first conference title in 33 years? Part of the answer lies with a slim, self-described nerd by the name of Tony Ortiz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of enjoying the title with the team on Saturday, Ortiz was perched high up in the bleachers, recording every single pitch and swing during the game — just as he’s done all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite only being a third-year, Ortiz has flourished this year as the Undergraduate Analytics Manager for the UCSB baseball team. Since 2017 — when former Director of Analytics Evan Short took over the position — UCSB has become the most analytically driven baseball program on the West Coast. Short pushed the coaching staff to raise the money to ensure that Santa Barbara has state-of-the-art equipment, including tools like TrackMan and Rapsodo that major league teams use for their statistics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, however, Short received an offer to help build the Toronto Blue Jays’ analytics department — an offer too good to turn down. After two years of revolutionizing Santa Barbara’s analytics usage, Short left for Major League Baseball, leaving a gaping hole for the baseball program to fill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter Ortiz.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Ortiz first joined the baseball staff last year, he was a baseball operations intern, helping out with whatever he could around the office. But when Short knew he was leaving, he began to groom Ortiz to take over his role with the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At first, I was only occasionally working with [Short], and it was more on the baseball side of things because I didn’t have the experience with statistics or programming,” Ortiz said. “Towards the end, however, I was writing reports to provide to the coaches so they had more information about what the players needed to work on during the season.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a team of four interns at his disposal, Ortiz’s main job is to be the liaison between the hard data and the coaching staff, turning the code written by his interns into easily interpretable and digestible bites for the coaches to understand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes my interns will come up with a report, and it will still be marked with the code they wrote,” Ortiz said. “I love seeing how they did it, but when it comes to giving it to the coaching staff, I tell them we need to get rid of all of that and just get to the point.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somehow, Ortiz manages to juggle his responsibilities as Undergraduate Analytics Manager with being a full-time statistics student at UCSB. In a typical day, Ortiz will go to the baseball office to upload and analyze videos, go to class and then head to the stadium to record statistics for the live bullpen sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The interns have been extremely helpful in my adjustment to this position,” Ortiz said. “It’s really nice to be able to rely on them for help, because it gives me more time to do the actual analysis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite his packed schedule, Ortiz thrives because of his unmitigated love for the sport of baseball. Before I could even ask  my first question prior to the game on Saturday, Ortiz unpacked the Gauchos’ devastating loss on Friday to me, explaining how UCSB’s high-risk, high reward-style offense ultimately backfired. While he uses some data in his analysis, Ortiz makes it clear that his love for baseball stretches beyond just a trendline or chart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think all the time that if I could play, I would give up all the analytic stuff to play just because I love the game that much,” Ortiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his passion and his drive, Ortiz has seamlessly filled in for Short, supplying data and analysis to the coaching staff whenever he can. Perhaps most importantly, the coaching staff has directly utilized the analysis Ortiz and his team provide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a more traditional game like baseball, some pundits and coaches are apprehensive to turn the game over to hard data and numbers. But under the direction of Head Coach Andrew Checketts, UCSB has wholeheartedly embraced the data revolution in baseball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coach Checketts and the coaching staff are very reasonable, and if they see something with evidence, they are going to take it and run with it,” Ortiz said. “The coaches have their own ideas of what the players should work on, and then they can use the analytics as support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, a data analytics team is nothing if the players themselves don’t buy in and aren’t willing to learn from data rather than relying on raw intuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps no player has embraced data as much as Boone has in his first year at Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Boone is a perfect example of a player where you can’t see how good he is until you look at his analytics numbers,” Ortiz said. “He’s not a flamethrower, but he has a wrinkle on his fastball — a little movement — that makes it harder to hit than just a regular fastball.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boone came into Santa Barbara without a plus fastball, but the analytics team broke down videos in the offseason to try to help the coaches develop his secondary pitches, including his changeup — the very changeup that played a vital role in Boone’s start on Saturday. Despite being completely behind-the-scenes, those video breakdowns ended up helping UCSB take home the Big West title for the first time in 33 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Ortiz’s main goals for next season is to incorporate more video and advanced statistics into the offensive side of things for the Gauchos. After putting most of his time and resources into helping the pitching staff, however, the results speak for themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, UCSB has pitched to a 3.21 ERA this season while racking up 491 strikeouts as a pitching staff, four strikeouts away from breaking the school’s single season record, which will likely be broken during the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve really built a culture here where the pitching staff has completely bought in on the analytics,” Ortiz said. “Like the Astros and Rays [in the pros], it’s just become a mindset with our team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He may never get the credit he deserves, but Ortiz has played an integral role in the Gauchos’ 45-9 season — the best record in program history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If the Gauchos can make it to Omaha, Ortiz will be ready, boxplot in one hand, Rapsodo in the other, to help the coaching staff bring a title back to Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
