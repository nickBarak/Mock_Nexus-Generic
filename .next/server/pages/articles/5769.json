The film is a perfect children’s film about family and a boy with a dream that takes places in a vibrant Mexican town of Santa Cecilia during <em>Día de Los Muertos</em>. The fun adventure that follows left me laughing throughout and crying by the end. “Coco” was my favorite film of the year and deserves to take the Oscar. The other nominations deserve credit, especially “Loving Vincent” for its use of real impressionist oil paintings in every frame of the film. In any other year, a film with that level of innovation would have a real chance to stand up to Pixar, but “Coco” is unstoppable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Actor</strong></p>\n<p>Who Should Win: Not Gary Oldman</p>\n<p>Who Will Win: Gary Oldman</p>\n<p>Gary Oldman’s performance in “Darkest Hour” is great. He’s a veteran actor who knows what he’s doing, and his ability to sink into a character that you might not expect from him is admirable. But let’s be honest, this is an extremely safe choice the Academy is going to make. “Darkest Hour” is a film that ticks every box for in the no-one-will-remember-this-in-five-years category. Instead, the Academy ought to give the award to Daniel Kaluuya, Timothée Chalamet or Daniel Day-Lewis, but it would be shocking if it did.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Actress</strong></p>\n<p>Who Should Win: Saorise Ronan</p>\n<p>Who Will Win: Frances McDormand</p>\n<p>I enjoyed Ronan’s naturalistic and believable persona as the titular character in “Lady Bird,” but Frances McDormand deserves to be the favorite here as well. She goes on a crusade in “Three Billboards” and is the driving force behind a film that is getting Best Picture buzz. Her role certainly asked her to do more than Emma Stone’s performance that netted her the trophy last year. In the end, while I’d like to see Ronan take it, McDormand has earned the trophy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Director</strong></p>\n<p>Who Will Win: Guillermo del Toro</p>\n<p>Who Should Win: Guillermo del Toro</p>\n<p>The Best Director/Best Picture split from the past few years might not bode well for “The Shape of Water” winning cinema’s biggest award because Guillermo Del Toro seems like a lock for Best Director. Del Toro’s work has always been imaginative, and this film might be his tightest and clearest depiction of that fantastical vision. The film’s imaginative use of color, costume, set design and visual effects oozes Del Toro as he brings the various elements into perfect harmony. No other director could imagine the fantastical flooded tableau that begins the film or the green hued color palate that dominates its visual landscapes. While many critics might point to identity politics as the reasons behind a possible Del Toro win, I would disagree. Mexican directors have won the Oscar in 2013, 2014 and 2015, but Del Toro won’t win because of the Academy’s interest in Mexican filmmakers; rather he will win because his individual voice shines through, just as Cuarón’s and Iñárritu’s before him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Picture</strong></p>\n<p>Who Should Win: “Get Out”</p>\n<p>Who Will Win: “The Shape of Water”</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind this is simple: “Get Out” is a cultural touchstone that will be remembered long after we forget “Darkest Hour” and “The Post.” Have you ever seen someone argue about Phantom Thread on Twitter? Now, every year we don’t give the Oscar to the movie with the biggest cultural momentum. But “Get Out” is not only an Internet touchstone, it is also a film deserving of such high honors in its technical aspects. The original screenplay has pushed writing in the horror genre forward in a way not seen for decades. The actors deliver incredible performances and Jordan Peele’s directorial voice is clear and captivating, despite “Get Out” being his debut film. “Get Out” needs to win the Oscar, but even if it doesn’t, it will remain in our consciousness long after we forget these other films.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s hard to predict the Best Picture Oscar, particularly will the influx of thousands of new voters in the last few years. I can see a few films winning the award, including my personal preference, “Get Out.” The favorite seems to be “The Shape of Water.” His is not a particularly traditional choice, but Del Toro’s film represents the way film can take viewers to a new, strange world. “Dunkirk” is another film with buzz, especially as the Oscars draw closer. While the film is indulgent in its cinematography and visuals, its storytelling leaves much to be desired, and Nolan shouldn’t win for a film that doesn’t live up to some of his other work. Still, the more traditional voting bloc of the Academy might heavily back “Dunkirk.” “Lady Bird” is a charming indie film, but doesn’t deliver enough to set it apart from others in its genre. “Three Billboards” might win on the back of McDormand’s one-woman crusade and act as a symbolic gesture toward the #MeToo movement, but it seems to have lost some momentum throughout awards season. “Get Out” being a horror film could hold it back. “The Shape of Water” pulls ahead as the slight favorite and would be a deserving winner, but the race is fairly wide open, so get your popcorn ready folks.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

praise, marking the 18th movie in the Marvel Comics Universe (MCU) and the last one before “Avengers: Infinity War” hits theaters in May. May will also mark the 10th anniversary of the first of these films, “Iron Man.” Over the past 10 years, the MCU has not had a truly terrible movie, though some of them have been fairly lackluster. In celebration of the fantastic “Black Panther” and in anticipation of “Infinity War,” here are the 18 films of the MCU, ranked:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18. “Thor: The Dark World”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The Dark World” isn’t bad, but it is overwhelmingly mediocre. Natalie Portman is normally a phenomenal actress, but she is clearly disinterested in the film and in her ostensible love interest. Tom Hiddleston as Loki gives the movie some charm and some drama, and Anthony Hopkins provides gravitas as Odin, but the movie miraculously gets mired in boring Earth drama that distracts from even more tedious sci-fi fantasy. Chris Hemsworth’s physique is certainly mighty, but the second “Thor” is not.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>17. “The Incredible Hulk”</p>\n<p>Edward Norton plays Dr. Banner/Mister Hulk in a movie that technically belongs to the franchise. Norton isn’t bad here, but Marvel was able to replace him with Mark Ruffalo in “The Avengers” with barely anyone noticing. “The Incredible Hulk” offers a dull, rote love interest and a CGI climax that looked ugly 10 years ago and has since aged like Ultron. It has some charm, but not enough to be worth remembering or re-watching.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>16. “Iron Man 2”</p>\n<p>The second “Iron Man” is a little bit of a mess, and its many subplots don’t always work well with each other and don’t always pan out. And after the dynamite first “Iron Man,” it was a little bit of a letdown. However, Robert Downey Jr. is still fantastic as the sardonic Tony Stark, and the Iron Man suit is still the coolest thing a 10-year-old will ever see. Don Cheadle steps into the role of Rhodes effortlessly, and Gwyneth Paltrow remains the most dynamic female lead in any of these films. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson are all fantastic actors and are fantastic in their individual parts, but they are too much in a film that is less than the sum of its parts. The movie is overstuffed, and the pieces of the whole don’t work, but it’s a whole lot of fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>15. “Ant-Man”</p>\n<p>“Ant-Man” took a long time to finally make it to the screen, and along the way it lost its original director and creative engine, Edgar Wright. The film still bears marks of his visual comedy and wit, but it will always be marred by the thought of what might have been. Despite the behind-the-scenes troubles, Paul Rudd is hilarious as Scott Lang, Michael Douglas is a perfect jerk as Hank Pym and Evangeline Lilly kicks butt as Hope van Dyne, the soon-to-be Wasp. The villain is underwhelming, and the movie is very non-essential, but it’s light, breezy and very funny. It would have been stronger if Evangeline Lilly had gotten to be super from the start, but that’s the biggest problem in an otherwise very agreeable film. It doesn’t aim for much, but it hits its mark right on target.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>14. “Thor”</p>\n<p>“Thor” is a weird movie. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, known for his Shakespearean filmography, half of the movie embraces its epic, bizarre setting. The other half plays as a fish-out-of-water story set in New Mexico. The plot is very basic, but the movie paces well, short and sweet. As far as the cast, Portman isn’t so boring in this one, and Hiddleston provides the franchise with its most persistent and charismatic villain. Hemsworth is very muscular in this one, too, and he gets to show a little of his comedic side, a hint of what’s to come nearly a decade later in “Thor: Ragnarok.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13. “Doctor Strange”</p>\n<p>“Doctor Strange” goes through many of the same beats as the original “Iron Man,” but if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a great Dr. Steven Strange (which is the character’s actual name), and the movie has a trippy visual palette that is a lot of fun. The action is a deviation from the typical superhero movie fare, with teleporting, alternate dimensions and a snarky cape. Tilda Swinton is good, Mads Mikkelsen is wasted, and Cumberbatch antagonizes himself by also playing Dormammu through motion capture. The finale works as a counterpoint to the rest of the paint-by-numbers plot of the movie, with a funny, inventive and clever climax. What’s more, the movie works as the most expensive PSA against texting and driving of all time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>12. “Iron Man 3”</p>\n<p>The reveal of Ben Kingsley’s Mandarin as a bumbling actor takes a lot of the gas out of “Iron Man 3.” Rebecca Ferguson’s character was destined to be the villain, not the murdered love interest, and the reworking of the film to focus on Guy Pearce’s Aldrich Killian as the antagonist really hurts it. Other than that clumsiness, though, the movie really shines. Shane Black directs, and the movie feels remarkably like a Black film, with his tonal and directorial sensibilities totally intact. In fact, his flair for dark comedy dovetails phenomenally with Downey Jr.’s snark. The movie offers a satisfying end to the “Iron Man” trilogy while providing room for the character to grow in later installments of the overarching MCU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>11. “Avengers: Age of Ultron”</p>\n<p>“Age of Ultron” goes a little awry with attempts to set up later films in the MCU running into the pacing of the main story, and while James Spader’s Ultron plays well as a snarky Frankenstein’s monster of Stark’s creation, the movie is caught in the trap of trying to balance too many plates. A 10-minute deviation to set up “Thor: Ragnarok,” (which is hilariously out of sync with the movie that actually got made), an out-of-nowhere romance between Black Widow and the Hulk and the hasty introduction and death of Quicksilver leave the movie feeling disjointed. However, the action is incredible, and the introduction to Paul Bettany’s Vision, a godlike android who is both mythic and alien, is one of the high points in the entire franchise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”</p>\n<p>The second “Guardians of the Galaxy” cranks up the humor, and, for the most part, it works. A few of the jokes undercut more serious moments, and the relationship between Chris Pratt’s Peter Quill and Michael Rooker’s Yondu could’ve been more developed, but the movie works. The soundtrack rivals the first film’s, Kurt Russell’s Ego is a far better villain, and the glorious color palette of the film pops with vibrant colors and a well-defined sci-fi aesthetic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>9. “Thor: Ragnarok”</p>\n<p>“Thor: Ragnarok” turns the “Thor” franchise into an outright parody of the superhero genre, albeit a loving parody. Exchanges are improvised, and the jokes never stop coming. Like all the best parodies, “Thor: Ragnarok” also works well as the genre it’s parodying. The action is gorgeous, and the score is absolutely bonkers with dramatic choirs, triumphant symphonies and blazing synths. The film is the embodiment of the bizarre, tacky sci-fi fantasies of the ’80s, and because of its brazen confidence and unwavering willingness to just be silly, the movie about Thor and the Hulk having space adventures just works.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8. “Guardians of the Galaxy”</p>\n<p>“Guardians of the Galaxy” offers a cosmic version of the Avengers, with many of the same draws. The dynamic of a team coming together is magical in a similar way, but what makes “Guardians of the Galaxy” so amazing is how it manages to introduce five protagonists and bring them together all in one film. Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket the Raccoon and Groot all enter the film as unknown entities and make their mark in a big way. The villain is a little weak, but other than that, the movie is an absolute jam.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7. “Spider-Man: Homecoming”</p>\n<p>As the sixth “Spider-Man” movie and the third iteration of the character on the silver screen, “Spider-Man” Homecoming” has to work to justify its existence. Fortunately, the movie is a joy. Tom Holland is pitch perfect as a Peter Parker struggling to become an Avenger while trying to get a date for homecoming. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is one of the MCU’s greatest villains, giving the movie a killer twist, and Iron Man is able to exist in the film as a mentor without stealing the spotlight. The cast is peppered with great comic actors, from Martin Starr to Hannibal Buress to Donald Glover, who fill the film with humor while grounding it in Parker’s very teenage world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6. “The Avengers”</p>\n<p>Watching “The Avengers” when it came out was an event. A sequel to five different movies at once with characters from each different franchise was something never before seen. The action was huge, and the immense battle scenes were offset by persistent charm and quips. Ruffalo enters as the Hulk without a hitch, working better in a team-up movie than the Hulk ever could by himself. Different aspects of the previous films come into play in a way that doesn’t punish viewers for having missed some of the previous movies, while also making the universe feel very full and fleshed out. “The Avengers” is a ton of fun with Earth’s mightiest heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5. “Captain America: Civil War”</p>\n<p>The third Captain America worked as an Avengers movie, but its Captain America branding gave it the narrative focus necessary to create some real drama and tight plotting. Chris Evans is steady and dependable as Captain America, while Downey Jr. stands out in his best performance of Iron Man yet. This is the movie that fits most effortlessly into the context of the Marvel universe, introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man into the story all while servicing the fundamental conflict of the film. Daniel Brühl plays Zemo as a relatable villain, though he is overshadowed by the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. The airport fight sequence where Avengers fight Avengers is the best in the series, and “Captain America: Civil War” is the best Avengers movie so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. “Iron Man”</p>\n<p>The first of the franchise, “Iron Man” came out nearly a decade ago and is still one of the high points of these movies. Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, with his playboy attitude underlined by moments of real humility. The movie uses an awareness of the real world and its politics and consequences to ground the fantastic narrative in reality. The end credits scene, the first of many to come, hinted at a broader universe in the making. “Iron Man” is funny, dramatic and creates the foundation for a universe immersive enough to handle 18-plus films.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. “Captain America: The First Avenger”</p>\n<p>“Captain America” is a World War II war movie that features not just a superhero but a very good man. Director Joe Johnston uses the movie’s period setting to create a story of black and white morality, with larger than life heroes fighting larger than life villains. The anachronistic HYDRA, with its space age weapons derived from a magic cube, is the perfect villain for this blast-from-the-past pulp adventure. The film’s over-the-top conflict of good vs. evil allows for Steve Rogers, played by Evans, to exist as a paradigm of selflessness and self-sacrifice, which is a refreshing fantasy in the more conflicted modern age.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. “Black Panther”</p>\n<p>T’Challa was first introduced in “Civil War,” but in “Black Panther,” he has a movie dedicated to himself and his world, and the movie is better for it. The first act is a little long and the last act is a little short, but Wakanda and its cast are so fully realized that they more than makes up for the film’s pacing problems. Michael B. Jordan’s Erik Killmonger is a villain who steals the scene every time he enters, and he is a critical part of the film’s political ideology. “Black Panther” is continually embarrassed by a wealth of riches, with its stacked cast, kinetic action and a vital story packed with meaning and thematic resonance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>“Captain America: The Winter Soldier”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“Captain America: The Winter Soldier” takes Steve Rogers from his simplistic, 1940s comfort zone of right and wrong and throws him headfirst into the 21st century. Robert Redford plays the film’s main villain, and his presence works perfectly with the film’s ’70s spy thriller tone. From bottom to top, the film’s construction is airtight. Humor is present in the film without undercutting the tension, and the action is as grounded as a superhero movie gets. While the film doesn’t wear its heart on its sleeve as boldly as “Black Panther,” it is still an intelligent movie with a point of view. “The Winter Soldier” also worked as a major paradigm shift in the MCU, altering its trajectory for the better. With almost no fluff to speak of, “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is almost a perfect piece of escapist entertainment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 11 of the Mar. 1, 2018 issue of </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81664\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81664\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/","id":5766,"author":{"id":770,"name":"Christien Skousen"},"related":[5765,5764,5763],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Not Trump 2016","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/trumpy-trump-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/trumpy-trump-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Austin Warner explains why he is committed to #NotTrump2016 ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Donald Trump first announced that he would be running for the Republican nomination, I got a laugh out of it.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is my favorite manga franchise. I never got to actually read it, but the original anime and its manga-faithful follow-up are my respective top-two favorite anime. The series has wonderful characterization, amazing world-building, fun humor and an all-around joyous sense of adventure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its live-action adaptation tries and fails miserably to capture that same feeling of wonderment. Alas, most filmic adaptations of manga and anime are doomed to suck, damned to lose their souls as filmmakers fail to grasp what makes them special in the first place. But I was hoping against all hope that this movie would escape that fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It at least gets the base essentials right, story-wise. Edward and Alphonse are two child prodigies versed in alchemy: the transmutation of different types of matter that allow them to transform objects. When their mother dies, they try to resurrect her, but transmuting humans is alchemy’s one and only major taboo. In the aftermath of their failure, Ed loses an arm and a leg and is forced to bind his little brother to a hulking suit of armor. They spend the next several years of their lives searching for the Philosopher’s Stone in the hopes of restoring their bodies.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the movie makes the one precise mistake adaptations are supposed to avoid: It crams so much of the manga’s story into a theatrical run-time that it is ultimately forced to sacrifice its characters. We hardly ever get to see Ed and Al interact, so we don’t feel the bond they share as brothers. The entire supporting cast, who all had expertly fleshed-out personalities and backstories in the source material (barring General Haruko, who gets more importance here than he ever did in the manga) get no such development here. More often than not, character relationships are developed through painful expositions and clumsily inserted flashbacks. The latter also exposes the film’s pacing problems: Flashbacks that could have and should have been just played out in a linear fashion interrupt scenes at the most opportune moments, killing the pacing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the movie becomes a confusing mess. If you’ve never even read or watched the source material, I imagine watching this movie would be like watching a WWE match for the first time without knowing any of the wrestlers’ backstories and rivalries. It’d be confusing and surreal, but you might be entertained to an extent, albeit embarrassed to admit it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also another interesting issue with this movie, something that flips a bad trend on its head. When “Ghost in the Shell” came out, it was accused of whitewashing Motoko Kusanagi into Mira Killian, played by Scarlett Johansson. This movie does the opposite: It casts Japanese actors in the roles of Germanic characters. So you have a J-pop idol playing a character named Edward Elric while wearing a blonde wig. Isn’t it awful? Singers shouldn’t be cast in major dramatic roles!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seriously though, it’s kinda weird. It doesn’t damage the movie, but still. Weird. Not as weird as the live-action “Attack on Titan” though. That’s a whole other can of worms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, it’s worth noting that anyone hoping to hear the Funimation dub cast reprise their roles for the first time in seven years will be bound for disappointment. The only English option available is audio description for the blind. I suspect the lack of a dub is because Funimation lost the rights to franchise two years ago, but still, it’s a bummer not to hear Vic Mignogna back as Ed or Travis Willingham as Mustang. The fact that the film is available in four total languages (original Japanese, Spanish, French and German) just rubs more salt into the wound. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film does manage to impress on two fronts, the first being the special effects. Its greatest achievement is Alphonse Elric, whose appearance is completely accurate to his original design and looks amazing, if not completely photo-realistic. The alchemy is always fun to watch, and a certain dog-human hybrid is just as unnerving as it ever was in the anime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second factor is the setting. Despite the fact that Amestris was based on ’30s Germany, the Italian interiors, cities and landscapes all add a genuine beauty to the photography, and in certain scenes the film almost feels like a period piece.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But all that doesn’t change the fact that the story is a veritable clusterfuck of the first third of the source material, with a hint of the last third injected for good measure. So many of the story beats from the early portions of the manga are unceremoniously shoved in that, as a huge fan of both TV shows, I had absolutely no idea what the hell was going on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks goodness then that both anime are both available on Netflix, too. For the love of god, watch those instead. Unless you’re a bored sadist, in which case I imagine there are better uses of your time out there — like watching “Dragonball: Evolution.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehrung is kidding, of course. A true bored sadist would watch “Berserk 2016.”</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81824\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-sacrifices-its-wonder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81824\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-sacrifices-its-wonder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-sacrifices-its-wonder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-sacrifices-its-wonder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-sacrifices-its-wonder/","id":5768,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5767,5766,5765],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
