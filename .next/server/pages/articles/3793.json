Police and fire officials determined that the female was deceased and later identified the female as second-year junior and double major in language, culture and society and philosophy Sierra Markee-Winkler.</p>\n<p>Plastino said police were able to determine the body as Markee-Winkler due to help from her roommate and forensic evidence.</p>\n<p>“During an area canvas, IVFP was approached by a female subject, who observed us carrying the decedent from the beach and was concerned that it may have been her missing roommate,” Plastino said. “Using forensics and a lead provided by [Winkler’s] roommate, the decedent’s identity was verified.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said investigation into the circumstances surrounding Markee-Winkler’s death are ongoing and that although a cause of death has not yet been determined, Markee-Winkler was missing the night before.</p>\n<p>“Preliminary investigation revealed that Markee-Winkler was involved in an argument with one of her roommates at her residence,” Plastino said. “Markee-Winkler, who had been drinking and was upset, left the residence and headed toward the 6800 block of Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>However, Plastino said that while Markee-Winkler was reported to be emotional when she left the scene, there was no sign of foul play and no one had followed her.</p>\n<p>“[The] Sheriff’s, Coroner’s and forensic team are working to determine the cause of death,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Until a full autopsy is completed, Plastino said, there are several possible causes of death, including a fall from the cliff. But Plastino said it is likely Markee-Winkler died from other causes due to her experience living in I.V. and the fact that her phone and sandals were found neatly placed behind the residence located at 6865 Del Playa.</p>\n<p>“Initially, we were thinking she accidentally fell off, but then we realized this is not the typical fall from the cliff. Unlike other victims, who are usually out-of-towners or [freshmen], she was a junior and knew the area well,” Plastino said. “But there is nothing to indicate that she threw herself off on purpose.”</p>\n<p>Plastino also said it was possible Markee-Winkler had gone down to the beach and fallen asleep on the sand when the waves were at low tide and was later unable to escape the high tide currents.</p>\n<p>“Remember, it is pitch black down there at night and the water is freezing. In that water, she wouldn’t have lasted 15 minutes,” Plastino said. “We have a lot of questions that still need to be answered.”</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, deputies also responded to a call on Saturday afternoon at approximately 1:05 p.m. from the Movement Ink store on 6556 Pardall Road. The store’s owner had detained an individual suspected of shoplifting.</p>\n<p>“The owner of the store was standing inside the shop detaining [the suspect]. The shop owner signed a citizen’s arrest form and stated [the suspect] walked out of the store with a hat worth $40 concealed under his shirt,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The owner confronted the suspect outside, Plastino said, which is when the suspect revealed the hat. After performing a background check on the suspect, officers discovered he had committed other acts of theft in the past.</p>\n<p>“[The suspect] admitted to law enforcement that he hid the hat under his shirt,” Plastino said. “A record check showed [the suspect] had been arrested less than a month prior for shoplifting at 7-Eleven and was a person of interest in a residential burglary in 2013.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested and eventually released with a citation for theft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, May 7, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/","id":3793,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3792,3791,3790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang","biography":"Not available","articles":[227,3070,3785,3787,3788,3790,3793,3796,3798,3799,3819],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to two cases of sexual assault — in addition to alcohol-related crimes and citations for trespassing and false imprisonment.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to two cases of sexual assault — in addition to alcohol-related crimes and citations for trespassing and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement have now released some of the details of a sexual assault incident that occurred on Friday night on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. According to IVFP Sergeant Mark Signa, deputies observed a girl sitting on a curb near the Isla Vista 7-11 crying and saying she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“She was very upset and — interviewed by IVPF — she stated she had been sexually assaulted on Del Playa Drive after leaving a party,” Signa said. “The suspect is unknown. He was either a Middle Eastern or Asian male.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday morning, deputies responded to a trespassing report on 6500 Del Playa Drive at 11 a.m. A female resident reported that at around 1:30 am, an unknown male had entered her home through a bathroom window. She and her boyfriend found the suspect, a college-aged Hispanic male, in their bathroom and then escorted him outside. After seeing the UCSB emergency alert regarding a sexual assault, the couple contacted officials and reported the incident.</p>\n<p>Also on Saturday night, Signa said deputies stopped a Del Playa resident from falsely imprisoning some of his party guests, after he attempted to flee authorities and prevented them from entering his house.</p>\n<p>“On Saturday night, on the 6700 block of Del Playa after midnight, several males were making lewd comments from their residence to passersby [mainly females], and in violation of noise ordinance,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa states that when deputies attempted to make contact with the males, they ran inside the house and refused to answer the door.</p>\n<p>“After 30 minutes of attempting to convince residents to open the door, deputies observed a female attempting to leave but was being physically restrained. The door was forced open. Approximately 70 people were inside,” Signa said. “Two people were contacted inside that were trying to leave, but were not allowed to.”</p>\n<p>One resident was given a citation for obstruction of justice and a misdemeanor charge of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Between 11 p.m. on Saturday and 4 a.m. on Sunday, another sexual assault occurred at an unknown location. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office reported that a 19-year-old female UCSB student was beaten and raped by three suspects described only as “Asian males.”</p>\n<p>According to Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, before the incident, the victim was last seen walking alone between midnight and 12:30 a.m. near Embarcadero Del Mar and Segovia Road. The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department is working alongside Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UC Police Department to locate the crime scene and suspects.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:15 p.m. on Tuesday, County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue volunteers were called in to search for any evidence that could assist with the investigation. They also plan to search possible crime scenes in eastern Isla Vista and on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the victim was released from the hospital Monday afternoon and is now with her family.</p>\n<p>The location of this assault and the suspects in both cases of sexual assault are still unknown.

After the incident, the student returned to her home in I.V., her roommate contacted police and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of her injuries and an examination, according to a press release. The other victim was a female of undisclosed age who was sexually assaulted behind a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The assault occurred near a party held on the same block in the early hours of Saturday morning. The assailant was described as a 5’6” male of “thin build” with dark hair and dark eyes who fled west — away from campus — after the assault, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Office Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, the recent incident of sexual assault in which one victim was beaten, as well as raped, by a group of suspects is a particularly rare and severe case.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, reports of sexual assaults in Isla Vista are not uncommon; however, this is definitely an extreme case,” Hoover said in an email. “The incident underscores the importance of not walking alone, especially at night, and to do everything in your power not to put yourself in a situation where you could become a victim.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of Take Back the Night — a campus group that supports victims of sexual assault — Kelty Kauffman, who is a second-year feminist studies and English double major, said the university and local law enforcement should do more to combat sexual assault on campus and in I.V., such as more educational campaigns.</p>\n<p>“There is never enough. The fact that we don’t teach a thorough discussion around consent to our freshmen is a problem,” Kauffman said. “When freshmen have to take Gaucho FYI, there’s a very minor portion on consent and I think that should be elaborated on because a lot of people don’t actually know what the definition of consent is.”</p>\n<p>While Kauffman said there is work being done to improve how the UC deals with sexual assault cases, she said there is still need for a change in how law enforcement treats rape cases and how victims are generally treated by society.</p>\n<p>“Currently, we enforce a culture of violence,” Kauffman said. “I have heard personal accounts of the police in Isla Vista not taking rape allegations seriously here and being condescending or dismissive of survivors, and that continues to contribute to a culture that tell survivors not to come forward with their stories and allows rapists to go free.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Sheriff’s Deputies and UCPD Officers are seeking information throughout the Isla Vista area as well as around campus to help identify and locate the suspects with the assistance of a Sheriff’s K9 Unit.</p>\n<p>If you have any information on the cases, the Sherriff’s Office asks to call 9-1-1 immediately or to leave an anonymous tip call at 805-681-4171.
