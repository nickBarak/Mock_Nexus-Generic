Both kept batters off balance by throwing breaking pitches, with Mazza’s curveball helping him get through 5.2 innings of relief and not allowing a run. The left-hander improved to 3-2 on the season after coming in for freshman starter Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to pick up my teammate, Bieber. He struggled a little bit, but he kept them to only two runs,” Mazza said. “I just wanted to come in and keep them where they were at, basically limit the inning and pound the zone.”</p>\n<p>With a new pitcher for Fullerton on the mound in the ninth, junior outfielder Cameron Newell singled up the middle on the first pitch of the inning to put a runner on first base. After a sacrifice bunt advanced the runner, the nation’s leading hitter, Epperson, connected on a fastball for his second walk-off hit against a ranked opponent in his career.</p>\n<p>“I thought they were just going to put me on, but when they didn’t, I figured they were pitching around me,” Epperson said. “I was trusting that Newell’s got good legs out there, and I was just trying to put a good swing on a ball, and not do too much.”</p>\n<p>Game one foreshadowed the closeness of the two teams. What was thought to be a low-scoring game turned out to be anything but as each team knocked around each side’s best pitcher early on.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ pitcher Thomas Eshelman came in with a 1.43 ERA and 5-1 record, but the Gauchos roughed him up for six earned runs, the most given up in his career. UCSB’s ace, junior Austin Pettibone did not fare better, lasting just three innings before exiting.</p>\n<p>The game was tied 9-9 in the tenth before darkness forced the match to be rescheduled before the start of game two. CSUF came out on top when play resumed by sneaking in two runs in the 11th inning for the hard fought 11-9 win.</p>\n<p>“You end in a tie to be resumed the next day and there’s a little bit of a letdown,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately they put a couple good swings together in that first half and we went down 2-0 right away. It was tough because I thought the day before I kind of felt if we grinded that out, it would’ve gone our way.”</p>\n<p>UCSB takes a break from conference play for today’s match against BYU. The Cougars are 14-23 overall on the season and 5-10 in the West Coast Conference after losing two games in its series against Pepperdine University.</p>\n<p>Brigham Young will rely on its three best hitters in junior third baseman Dillon Robinson, senior infielder Brock Whitney and freshman outfielder Brennon Lund. Each is hitting above .300 and will cause problems for UCSB pitching.</p>\n<p>First pitch is scheduled for 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 14th’s

The highly selective SHCD certificate allows the city access to state funds for planned affordable housing developments, according to Greene.</p>\n<p>Greene said Goleta received $3.6 million in “active transportation grants,” that will fund bicycle path and walkway improvements.</p>\n<p>According to Greene, retail and industrial vacancies are both low at less than three percent vacancy, and hotel occupancy increased 13.8 percent over the last year.</p>\n<p>Greene also said an increase in revenue from taxes such as the Transient Occupancy Tax and Sales Tax indicate Goleta’s financial future is bright.</p>\n<p>“Goleta is an excellent place to start and run a business,” Greene said. “Goleta’s overall position is solid and our future is promising.”</p>\n<p>Miller also said there are plans to revamp Goleta’s Old Town and capitalize on the uniquely authentic quality that it offers Goleta residents.</p>\n<p>“We have so many great neighborhoods in Goleta that are already flourishing,” Miller said. “But there’s something that feels like our soul and our purpose when we visit Old Town.”</p>\n<p>President and CEO of Montecito Bank and Trust Janet Garufis said the Goleta business community has played a crucial role in the immense progress the city has made over the past years.</p>\n<p>“The businesses in Goleta are so connected to each other, it is just extraordinary,” Garufis said. “There are so many great things happening in this community and that could not happen without the support of local businesses.”</p>\n<p>According to Bacara Resort &amp; Spa General Manager Kathleen Cochran, supporting local business in Goleta is crucial to the development of the city.</p>\n<p>“I live here, I do all of my business here,” Cochran said. “Community partnership and hospitality go hand in hand.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic building are currently underway, and new tenants providing mental health reseources for I.V. residents are set to move in in July. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors approved a renovation budget of approximately $335,000 for the Isla Vista Clinic building on Tuesday to refurbish and lease currently vacant office spaces.</p>\n<p>The planned renovations will allow for additional tenants to lease office spaces in the building, one-third of which is currently used by I.V. Clinic. Of the nine organizations who applied for a lease, Santa Barbara County general services staff chose the Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, Regents of the University of California and Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. for the clinic. All three are slated to sign five-year leases and to agree to a three percent annual rent increase.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Assistant Director for General Services Greg Chanis said the county assumed ownership of the building last summer and chose these three specific nonprofit organizations to best serve community needs.</p>\n<p>­“There was a lot of community support for the county to retain ownership of the building,” Chanis said. “Based on that, the county is really working on having the building be a community asset.”</p>\n<p>According to the Board of Supervisors’ proposal for the clinic renovations, the Regents will lease space to set up offices for a variety of campus mental health services available to students and I.V. residents. Resources will include Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.), Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and Student Mental Health Coordination Services (SMHCS).</p>\n<p>Third-year literature and sociology major and former C.A.R.E. student staff member Emily Potter said expanding C.A.R.E.’s services in I.V. will be beneficial to non-students seeking support.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be excellent for the community to have a space like CARE in Isla Vista,” Potter said in an email. “CARE’s services are not just limited to UCSB students so I’m really excited at the possibility that the additional location will let students from SBCC and other community members with a need for advocacy resources to feel they have better access to them.”</p>\n<p>Potter said the community will benefit greatly from the renovation of these spaces, as this means there will be room for the expansion of mental health services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It will allow services like CARE to expand because of the additional space and I think there is a great need for that, so the opportunity for the growth of the program is great too,” Potter said in email.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. Fiscal Manager and Board Member Arthur Kennedy said the leased office space will be used for the organization’s administrative needs, though they are also considering incorporating other services such as a weekly family resource center.</p>\n<p>“We need the space, because we only have about four office workers in our Goleta office,” Kennedy said. “But we are considering having a weekly family resource center availability within these offices as well as other services.”</p>\n<p>According to Chanis, renovations are underway and tenants are expected to move into the office spaces in July.</p>\n<p>“We’re finishing up the exterior stairwell, and are nearly completed with the roof,” Chanis said. “So the interior and exterior are undergoing renovations that should open up the space for the tenants.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said while the I.V. Clinic renovations will provide necessary services, she plans to develop a community center in the building adjacent to the clinic that formerly housed the Saint Athanasius church.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the space that we want as a community center — we are still looking for the moment to do that at the rehabilitation of a former church building,” Farr said. “The tenants should be meeting this summer at the new fiscal year and then I’m turning my attention to rehabilitating the church to turn into a community center.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of teh Thursday May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63411\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/county-to-revamp-lease-clinic-offices/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63411\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/county-to-revamp-lease-clinic-offices/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/county-to-revamp-lease-clinic-offices/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/county-to-revamp-lease-clinic-offices/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/county-to-revamp-lease-clinic-offices/","id":4710,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4709,4708,4707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 14 UCSB Hits the Road to Face Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will look to continue its strong play against Long Beach State after winning last week's series against Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off three wins in its past four games, the No. 14 UCSB baseball team eyes its first conference series win on the road starting tonight against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game 23-8 overall and 4-5 in the Big West after Monday’s nonconference victory against BYU.

Hopefully the way we’ve been playing continues to reward us this weekend at Long Beach.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach State presents a different challenge for Santa Barbara. The Dirtbags have won three of their last seven series and enter 16-18 overall and 3-3 in league.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s winning formula has been pitching and defense. Senior pitcher Josh Frye has been the ace of the staff and pitches the second game of the series. The right-hander has started the last three weeks and the team has gone 3-0 in each of his appearances. Frye has been nearly unhittable, allowing just a run in his last 16 innings and five hits combined during his last two starts.</p>\n<p>Just as unhittable has been junior closer Kyle Friedrichs. In six save opportunities, the closer has converted all of them without giving up a run or walk, with just two hits. Opposing batters are hitting a mere .105 against him.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s efficiency on defense is shown in its .980 fielding percentage, the eighth highest in the country. In total, the Dirtbags have committed just 27 errors this season.</p>\n<p>Although not as reputable as Cal State Fullerton, UCSB learned how tough the Big West is earlier in the season when it lost its series against Hawaii University and will be careful not to repeat its mistake.</p>\n<p>“When you have a good year, you have a target on your back,” Epperson said. “I wouldn’t expect Long Beach to be any different. We’re preparing just like we prepared for Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have consistently been able to put up runs on the scoreboard. Statistically, Santa Barbara is top in the league in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and homeruns.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s offensive statistics are a testament to the team’s potent lineup, no hitter in the country this year has been seeing the ball as clear as Epperson.</p>\n<p>Epperson leads the nation with a .451 batting average and his numbers have been recognized with him being added to the Midseason “Golden Spikes Award” Watch List — the award given to the top amateur player in the country. His most underrated aspect, however, has been his versatility to hit anywhere in the batting order, from leadoff to the cleanup spot.</p>\n<p>“There’s really not a lot of pressure on each individual offensively, and I certainly feel that way,” Epperson said. “I’m really comfortable on the leadoff spot and I’ll hit wherever, and I kind of feel like I’m just going to go for it and do whatever I can to help the team win.”</p>\n<p>Just as dominant as Epperson, has been the UCSB bullpen. When leading after six innings, Santa Barbara is 17-0 with much of the credit going to sophomore closer Dillon Tate and his eight saves on the season, second overall in conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send sophomore Justin Jacome and junior Austin Pettibone for games one and two, respectively. Saturday’s starter is yet to be announced.</p>\n<p>First pitch tonight is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54887\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54887\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/","id":4711,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4710,4709,4708],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
