Not only will the Gauchos play in the final conference home games of the season, which doubles as an opportunity to recognize the team’s seniors, but the Fullerton Titans are currently ranked No. 1 in the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a challenge,” junior outfielder Brett Vertigan said. “It’s been the same structure at practice this week, but we’ve been really focused.”</p>\n<p>UCSB currently stands at No. 5 in conference rankings with a 9-9 league record and a 23-22 mark overall. Fullerton tallies a league-leading 12-3 record and is 30-14 on the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos enter the series after a 0-3 showing against UC Irvine on the road last weekend. Irvine contained the UCSB offense to just four runs in the series, including two shutout losses. UCSB’s Vertigan led the team with three hits on the weekend, while freshman left-handed pitcher Andrew Vasquez only allowed one run in 6.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The Titans are coming off a three-game series sweep against Pacific on the road last weekend, and a solo- game series win against USC just days before. In its last 11 games, Fullerton is 9-2 overall, with five wins coming on the road.</p>\n<p>A dynamic to watch for throughout the weekend will be the play that originates behind the plate for each team. While Fullerton is tied for No. 1 in the league with a .285 batting average, and leads the league with a .366 on-base percentage, UCSB is No. 4 in both categories. Vertigan currently leads the league in batting average with a .371 mark and is No. 2 in on-base percentage behind teammate sophomore infielder Brandon Trinkwon.</p>\n<p>However, the defensive play of both teams will likely determine who takes the wins this weekend. Both squads boast impressive statistics in regards to allowing runs for opponents; Fullerton gives up just 3.59 runs per game while UCSB allows only 4.62.</p>\n<p>“I feel like pitching is going to be strong in this series too,” Vertigan said. “I think it’s going to be similar to the Irvine series. Not a bunch of runs scored … we have three solid pitchers going out there and I know they have some good guys too.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could potentially break into the top three teams in league with a strong showing against Fullerton this weekend, which would further their chances of post- season success.</p>\n<p>“If we win these three against Fullerton, and then the next three against Cal Poly, we still have a chance to take first in league,” Vertigan said. “But a lot of things have to go into that happening.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for today at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46872\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46872\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/ucsb-faces-topranked-fullerton/","id":4375,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4374,4373,4372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella","biography":"Not available","articles":[716,743,762,820,848,852,1078,1644,1646,1647,1648,1649,1651,1654,1662,1665,1667,1671,1672,1673,1677,1678,1679,1683,1684,1686,1688,1690,1693,1694,1695,1696,1700,1719,1757,1761,1764,1767,1768,2160,2844,4375,4473,4491,4502,4510,4511,4512,4513,4514,4515,4516,4517,4519,4520,4527,4528,4530,4532,4536,4537,4538,4542,4543,4547,4557,4559,4561,4562,4564,4565,4566,5533],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Juice It Up!

The new store opened next to HiWi Tropical Fusion on 6555 Pardall Road as part of a franchise partnership between the two stores.</p>\n<p>The juice bar will sell blended smoothies, açaí and pitaya bowls and pressed and raw juices.</p>\n<p>The Friday grand opening included live music, prize giveaways and local vendor product samplings.</p>\n<p>Monica Martinez, president of HiWi Inc. and the new Juice It Up! location, said the company wanted to bring the juice bar to I.V. to offer a healthy food option to the UC Santa Barbara campus and community.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! will not serve beer or wine, Martinez said, because “there’s already enough alcohol in I.V.”</p>\n<p>“We know that it’s really good for profit, but we’re not here just for profit. We’re really here to try to be a sustainable business,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! is one of many raw juice bar companies HiWi Fusion considered partnering with before making their final decision. Other candidates for the juice locale included Jamba Juice and Maui Wowi.</p>\n<p>Martinez said she chose to partner with Juice It Up! because of its high quality products.</p>\n<p>“They actually have a full-time food scientist who does hours and hours of testing to make sure that it’s the best and healthiest product out there,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up!’s notability as a brand was also a factor in the final decision, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“People would be more familiar with something that they’re used to,” said Martinez. “There are a lot of students at UCSB that are from Southern California, and Juice It Up! is originally from Southern California.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said she hopes the option to order Juice It Up! online will be helpful for students that do not have time to eat breakfast. Customers can place an order online and pick it up on their way to class, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“Most students do not have time to stop and eat breakfast, so a smoothie or a bowl or a protein shake or raw juice is often a quick breakfast for them,” she said. “They’ll have their drink ready to go and they can have their breakfast on their way to class.”</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! takes online orders through their website <em>hiwifusion.com/menu</em> and offers pick-up and delivery through SBmenus and UberEATS.</p>\n<p>The new store will be open between 7 a.m. and 10:00 p.m Monday through Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/","id":4372,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[4371,4370,4369],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Freebies and Activities in I.V.
