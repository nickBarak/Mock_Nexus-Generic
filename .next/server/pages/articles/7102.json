For its 37th year, Guerneville hosted a fun weekend of top-notch acts at the Russian River Blues and Jazz Festival. The entertainment included Serbian-born Ana Popovic, New Orleans’ Trombone Shorty and the magnificent Gary Clark Jr.</p>\n<p>From the foodies at the ahi poke booth to the thirsty teen in line for a snow cone, the festival folks found Ana Popovic to be an unexpected delight. “That girl can rock!” admired the middle-aged restaurateur as he prepared a gourmet turkey pesto panini.</p>\n<p>And rock she did. Giving credit to the blazing sun above, she began with her groovy single “Can You Stand The Heat”. Popovic shined in the sizzling heat of Guerneville. She rocked red stilettos and a short, skin-tight silver dress, her unruly Ke$ha hair swinging side to side. She rested her Fender strat on her right hip with her knee jumping out to greet us.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Popovic’s music and fiery style speak of her volatile political past living in former Yugoslavia. Born in Belgrade, Serbia in 1976 to a musical family, Popovic picked up the guitar at 15 years old. Against the backdrop of the explosive Milosovic nationalist regime, she honed this craft to become the fierce, unapologetic musician she is today.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most surprising asset of Popovic is her powerful vocals. She speaks like Ana Ivanovic but sings like Etta James. Combine that with her electrifying guitar solos and you’ve got a bluesy rock guitarist with the funky, old school vibe of Albert Collins and WAR. She is quite the foxy lady. In fact, she will be joining the Jimi Hendrix Experience tour, along with all-star musicians including Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang and Bootsy Collins.</p>\n<p>Following the feisty Serbian was a down-to-earth, multi-instrumentalist whose virtuosity would make Mozart blush. As far as hot trombone/trumpet blues musicians go, Trombone Shorty is a ten. He is the lead of Trombone Shorty &amp; New Orleans Avenue, the funk band that incorporates jazzy tones, hip-hop beats and hints of rock and roll.</p>\n<p>His feisty single “Fire and Brimstone” got the audience in the mood to groove. Trombone Shorty illuminated the stage with his compelling solos and sensual voice, while also displaying remarkable chemistry with bass guitarist Michael “Bass” Ballard. His easy way of allowing Ballard to take center stage and show finger-plucking chops gave the effect of a garage band jam session.</p>\n<p>Ripping off his shirt in the middle of the performance, Shorty paid tribute to his New Orleans background by gesturing towards an audience member for her emerald green mardi gras beaded necklace. He brought us to his old N’awlins neighborhood, bouncing across the stage and energizing the crowd with his spunky spirit.<br>\nDon’t underestimate this fantastic artist by his deceiving nickname, which he earned as a wee little six-year-old musician barely as tall as his instrument.<br>\nShorty is just as unpretentious and irresistible as his music is. His sheer soul and ability to move people made him an incredible performer.</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, there was one man who controlled the river, and his name is Gary Clark Jr. Prowling onstage in a maroon v-neck and black fedora, Clark’s masculinity was very apparent. “I’m in love with you Gary!” was the common crowd murmur, and the self-taught guitarist returned the love with a mesmerizing take on “Bright Lights”. Clark has the keen habit of turning four-minute songs into 15-minute existential experiences, and the anguish and pain from the creases on his face as he felt up the whammy bar made the audience nearly double over in a frenzy.</p>\n<p>“I feel good,” the thirty-year-old uttered into the microphone, duly gazing at the river with all of its musically-intoxicated inhabitants. 3,000 heads nodded in agreement, especially those who sailed to the festival via canoes and avoided the $55-a-day cover charge.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Russian River Festival brought a big sound to a small town, and the appreciation was felt on every end of Guerneville. Hats off to its creator, Omega Events — this little festival packs a whopper!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 12 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56240\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56240\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/russian-river-little-festival-that-could/","id":7102,"author":{"id":756,"name":"Jane Huson"},"related":[7101,7100,7099],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":756,"name":"Jane Huson","biography":"Not available","articles":[5997,6024,6027,6061,7038,7094,7102,7608],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Way Over Yonder Festival To Bring Folk Music to Santa Monica","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Way Over Yonder, self-described “younger cousin” of the Newport Folk Festival, will bring a variety of music acts to the iconic Santa Monica Pier this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Way Over Yonder, self-described “younger cousin” of the Newport Folk Festival, will bring a variety of music acts to the iconic Santa Monica Pier this weekend.</p>\n<p>The Newport Folk Festival famously spurred the careers of several beloved artists including Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, and Way Over Yonder aims to bring that tradition the West Coast. The festival will span over Friday and Saturday evening, headlined by Jackson Browne and Local Natives. Supporting acts include Lucinda Williams, Chris Robinson Brotherhood, Jamestown Revival and Heartless Bastards.</p>\n<p>Jackson Browne’s authentic, soul-baring classics promise to appeal as much to millennials in the audience as to baby-boomers who grew up listening to him. His 70’s folk will be nicely complimented by Local Natives, who represent a more modern take on the genre. The recent Extravaganza headliners are sure to play an exciting set of their psychedelic-influenced tunes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lineup as a whole represents a wide spectrum of artists falling under the category of “folk”. Folk’s central characteristics have always been hotly contested, making a definition that is difficult to pin down, but Way Over Yonder embraces this variability. Artists must have some roots in the tradition of the travelling American singer-songwriter in order to be considered for the festival, but they are not required to be strictly definable as folk. Way Over Yonder takes pride in following the footsteps of the Newport Folk Festival by expanding the definition of the genre. As a result, even veteran folk fans are sure to hear something new this weekend.</p>\n<p>As far as locations go, it’s difficult to imagine a more idyllic one than the Santa Monica Pier. Festival attendees will be treated with views of the Pacific Ocean just beyond the view of their favorite band. The pier contains its own amusement park, as well as many popular restaurants and shops. There will also be food vendors and several bars within the festival.</p>\n<p>With its strong lineup and enviable location, there is little more one could ask from this festival.

A day before Fuck Yeah Fest … Fest the weekend of Aug. 23-24, my friend managed to sprain her ankle and acquire a pair of crutches that might as well have been diamond encrusted and leafed in gold. Why? Because getting to the front of the lines (I heard) took up to two hours at the entrance, something I was wondrously unconcerned with.</p>\n<p>My friend got our group of four in both days within five minutes; no checks, no questions, letting us in through the gate to Vacant-ville Wonderland where you can flail your arms freely under the constellation twinkle with Angel Olsen and make lawn angels with Joanna Gruesome, free to enjoy for a sweet moment the un-peopled smells of your bathed self. Fuck yeah!</p>\n<p>Everyone has been talking about what a logistical nightmare the festival was. We — all 40,000 of us — received a consolation email from Sean Carlson apologizing on behalf of the canteen thieves at the front lines, the flash-flooded Metro, the Arena incident on Saturday (I’ll get to that), and essentially admitting defeat by concluding with, “I know a few of you may not have plans to come back but hopefully in the future you will hear about how smooth things have become and will change your mind.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But after the first day, I became savvy to the horseshoe monkey wrench that shaped the trek from the main stage to the entrance. The hard truth I had to swallow was that there would be no show hopping — too much ground to cover. It just wasn’t worth it (unless you’re the kind of shotgun DJ who changes the song every 30 seconds).</p>\n<p>Where you walk is what you get. Or, if you’ve got game, you can beat the design, outrun the dazed mass-Mac crowd at the dead end Main Stage, pass them through the bottleneck forest, swim your way through the sea of swirly-twirly acid droppers and catch most of Thundercat at the front entrance.</p>\n<p>Part of why I was floating around having a grand old time was because my line-up picks were not heavily located at the stage in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Unhindered in guitar band-land, I freely moved above ground, where it was up to me to determine how fast or how close.</p>\n<p>Though I happened to win at the logistical crapshoot, I feel the need to honor those who lost. The Arena incident is a touchy subject for a lot of recent FYF vets. Tatiana Gefter of UCSC said the line-up in the Arena on Saturday was the main reason she bought the tickets, a common story. Chet Faker, Todd Terje, Caribou, Four Tet and DJ Harvey. (Ahem, I missed what?)</p>\n<p>Here’s what happened: on the electronic edge of the knife, an arena where the FYF booking agents were voraciously kicking-ass, there were a lot of unhappy campers. Clogged like arterial plaque, the Chet Faker hopefuls congregated in furious mobs around the single entrance to the entire Arena Stage: two escalators.<br>\nAt 5:20p.m. I dipped out of the Arena, leaving a determined Gefter who was ready to cross crutches to get in there. Tip: don’t cry, just dance. I learned then and there, the Arena wasn’t going to jibe for me, so I cut my losses and went to Albert Hammond Jr. and rocked my socks off instead. Post-fest, the bitter bloggers sounded as if they had been robbed of their intrinsic right to Faker. Gefter was so discouraged that she didn’t attempt to go back for Caribou. But according to Speak Volumes Editor Jonny Lipshin, the entrance was reopened in time for Todd Terje.</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that an incensed beer vendor told bystanders how it all went down. According to this vendor, FYF’s mythical father, Sean Carlson, was disputing a beer sales percentage previously agreed upon, so the good beer-people refused to sell beer, which one can imagine is a serious problem. The argument heated up near the bottom of the escalators, causing security (who were freaking out) to close the entrance completely. The gridlock lasted throughout Faker’s entire set, while security chased kids out of the stands and twitter exploded.</p>\n<p>Lipshin estimated with the vendor that close to a hundred lucky ones populated the “basically empty” arena, one which maxes out for sports events at around 16,000 seated occupants. You do the math: thousands of scrawny scrappy hipsters squeezing to be under the air-conditioned disco ball fantasy — while inside is only a measly hundred? I’ll admit I was a little PTSD and avoided the Arena until Darkside the next day (which blew my mind with the trippy orb tunnel shooting straight out and Dave Harrington killing it on guitar).</p>\n<p>Regrets: not dancing to Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks’ Little Fang, not singing louder at Mac Demarco (much to the chagrin of my neighbors just enduring the Main Stage until The Strokes), not lying in the grass during Slowdive, and relinquishing my hold on Ty Segall’s pectorals in order to plunge into the writhen snake-pit to pull my friend off the ground. (Speaking of Mac, was anyone else confused when his talkative bassist, Pierce McGarry, turned to Mac and in a spacey tone asked him if he remembered driving their tour bus off a cliff one time. Mac replied, “Oh yeah, I remember that,” to which McGarry replies, “Yeah… there’s like no way we should have survived that.”)</p>\n<p>Successes: spending my last dollars and getting liquored up on a haystack in the beer garden under the swaying blue lights, then infiltrating the gathering Strokes crowd on the left. We slid in among people of our kind. A girl tucked her curls behind her ear to reveal a 12:51 tattoo, and my friend and I had waited a decade to see the band of my formidable youth.</p>\n<p>That dog Julian Casablancas kept us waiting for 15 minutes before he rolled in looking haggard and well-lived in. His voice was the same as ever, opening with “Barely Legal”. I felt I could finally seal off my teenage years, complete when they played “Under Control”. They stuck to Room on Fire a lot, and only played one off the new, less beloved album.</p>\n<p>When it was all over, I remained where I was, denying the lights and the droning country music to ward us all off. We cut to the side, and from against the fence watched the last entrails of a pleasured crowd head off to battle the Metro. Shuffling my feet, taking in the last images, I overheard story swapping, favorites and frustrations. We sang under our breath, “the end has no end, the end has no end”.</p>\n<p>That brings me to my next point: follow your own feet. My friend got us in all good and well, but one fundamental difference in our festival fitness is that I have the agility of a coked-out cheetah comparatively to this poor girl on crutches. I left her and the rest of my group in a nicotine fog and ventured out to seek the many fortunes these two days promised me.</p>\n<p>I learned at Outside Lands (yes, me so lucky!) that you’re there for the music, so don’t go to artists you couldn’t give two shits about, trailing after a group of friends just for the company. If you bought the tickets to see your bands, by all that is good and true, go to them! If you don’t, you have secured your heartstrings in a torture rack to be pulled in opposite directions for two days straight.</p>\n<p>But few people had to endure these circumstances anyway, because the line up was ridiculous. You really couldn’t go wrong. I read an article pre-fest supposedly pairing down the “top” recommendations. Maybe the writers of that review, who included nearly every artist, were on the same page as whoever decided to tack on the second “Fest” after “Fuck Yeah Fest”, or the La Brea (translation: tar pit) Tar Pits, thinking the more the merrier? There were too many great artists and not enough jet-packs. Also in abundant supply all weekend were the perennial “Fuck yeah” jokes and comments from the performers. But all we could do was echo back our unanimous “fuck yeah’s” because it’s true — everyone was feeling fucking great.</p>\n<p>It was the attitude that made everything just fine. Lipshin noted that back in 2012 at L.A. Historic Park they put down mats to keep down the punk-dust. Everyone at the shows I went to was (with the exception of one, Mr. Demarco) down for dirty nostrils because moshing to Against Me! and Ty Segall is more important than breathing.</p>\n<p>After all is discussed, errors and grievances are aired, Lipshin, fondly recounting his consecutive years of Fest Fests concluded, “The line-ups blow my shorts off every time.” And ain’t that the truth.</p>\n<p>Folks, if you can’t handle a little grit, a fight to get to your musical mecca, than stick to your vinyl. If you allow some wiggle room, ride the wave and are willing to make some compromises, this festival has a lot of potential and already does so much right. Passing by those vendors placed next to the giant inflatable piece-of-poop emoji, those thrifty prints calling out to me, and Frank O’Hara references at the used book swap, brought the funky boulevard backdrop of our DIY pastime. Last tip: BYOB. Racking up an alcohol bill to match the cost of your two-day pass is shameful. (I’m not admitting to anything here.) Until 2015 FYF! Hope you get it right-er next year.</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 10 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/fyf-fest-one-gals-guide-to-the-fest-fest/","id":7100,"author":{"id":763,"name":"Natalie O'Brien"},"related":[7099,7098,7097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Outside Lands Festival: Notes from a Veteran","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nestled away somewhere in between the disc golf courses and barbecue pits of Golden Gate Park, the seemingly instantaneous assembly of labyrinthian fences and headlining stages mark both the conclusio...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Nestled away somewhere in between the disc golf courses and barbecue pits of Golden Gate Park, the seemingly instantaneous assembly of labyrinthian fences and headlining stages mark both the conclusion of whatever poor excuse of a hot season San Francisco calls summer and the inauguration of Northern California’s one-word answer to Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival — Outside Lands (okay, it’s actually two words).</p>\n<p>It’s 11 a.m. Saturday, August 9th (unfortunately, I missed Friday). I hastily packed my festival bag while downing two cups of coffee, and traversed the five city blocks from my parents’ home to get to my fifth consecutive Outside Lands. The park grass was damp from remnants of the morning fog, and the sun, obscured by dark ominous clouds, left the temperature lingering around a chilly 60 degrees: perfect Outside Lands weather. In line for the main entrance, I spotted a man sporting a worn flannel over a grey Joy Division t-shirt approach one of the soldiers of the security guard army. As the guard turned to point him in his desired direction, flannel-man ran through the supply gate into a crowd of festival-goers faster than Usain Bolt sprinting the 100 meter. Every year the hipsters get hipper and the fences grow taller, but some things will never change. I take comfort in this.</p>\n<p>After what seems like an eternity of wading through a sea of tribal-patterned hand-knit shawls and tweed Crossroads suspenders, I reached the entrance at last. The ticket-scanner grunted me in with a powerful indifference that I can only take to mean, “Thanks for your patronage! I wish you a merry time enjoying the beautiful art and world-class music that only this celebration of culture has to offer!” Needless to say, I couldn’t help thinking that the sooner I was on the same side of the fence as the Dum Dum Girls, the better.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Land’s End, the main stage, is located at the edge of a great grassy expanse known as the Polo Fields, and it’s this area that really captures the essence of Outside Lands. The Polo Fields are a vibrant bazaar of festival eateries, merchandise stores and most importantly, urban art installations. Locally famous street artists garbed in HAZMAT suits can be seen spray-painting enormous particle-board canvases with dastardly wizards, feral gorillas and other monsters from your two-year-old’s nightmares. If there’s anything that can be said about Outside Lands it is that, while it does not boast the biggest and best lineup, the festival management does a good job of keeping the party about the art and music and not the other way around.</p>\n<p>Outside Lands does feature some party-oriented music acts (e.g. Duck Sauce, Tiësto and Disclosure, to name a few,) but, unlike most analogous festivals across the country, it does not feature a stage that is headlined by purely dance music acts. In order to have a really good time at Outside Lands, you’ll need to be familiar with some of the artists and know the words to a few songs, and this draws a crowd of devout music fans. When droves of twenty-somethings left Atmosphere early to join the hoard of tired baby-boomers at Tom Petty’s closing set at the end of the night, it was something special.</p>\n<p>While not completely absent at other large festivals, these authentic music fans comprise the majority of Outside Lands attendees, and this makes the Outside Lands community feel refreshing even to veteran festival-goers. Additionally, this allows management to continue to keep booking up-and-coming musicians such as Warpaint and Gold Panda … even if sometimes the bill includes a beat-boxing cello player whose amplifier is powered by a volunteer on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips on having the ultimate OSL experience. First, don’t be afraid to dance like a hippie to your favorite indie act, because people will join you without fail if you dance hard enough. Second, although a little pricy, the chimmichurri fries from 4505 Meats will be worth it every time.</p>\n<p>Third, roam around the festival grounds, and don’t be worried about occasionally losing your friends; you’ll find new friends if you mouth lyrics to songs you don’t know the words to. Fourth, bring a hoodie. If you’re not dancing harder than Samuel T. Herring, San Francisco nights can be about as unforgiving as exile in Siberia. Lastly, see a new act. Support struggling musicians, because acts with goofy names like Yellow Ostrich, Fitz and the Tantrums, or GRiZ might just become your next bread-and-butter group.<br>\n<em>Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival takes place in every year in Golden Gate Park the second week of August.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 11 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/outside-lands-festival-notes-from-a-veteran/","id":7101,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[7100,7099,7098],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
