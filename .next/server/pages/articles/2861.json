SJP President and second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur was the main speaker for the presentation and began the event speaking about the many ways in which Palestine is affected by the occupation and apartheid of the region, as well as the U.S.’s relationship with the conflict.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, the problems in Palestine span a wide range of humanitarian issues that transcend the political motives controlling the region.</p>\n<p>“In regards to Palestine, it connects to women’s issues, queer issues, environmental problems, state violence, immigration and displacement of indigenous populations,” Kaur said. “It goes beyond transnational borders because it is much more than people perceive. It does not just affect one group of people with one issue.”</p>\n<p>Kaur said the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting case of Michael Brown in the U.S. is directly tied to Palestinian oppression because the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) trained some members of the American police force who were active in Ferguson.</p>\n<p>“The government in Palestine is super fearful of public opinion and resistance. But the IDF trains the police in the U.S. to have the same fear,” Kaur said. “It is connected to the Ferguson issue because the police here are trained to oppress resistance at all violent costs. It was a case of rampant anti-blackness.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, police brutality leading to the death of innocent people is modeled after “the hatred and strategy of the Israeli army.” Kaur said the strategy stems from the fear of possible opposition, aiming to abuse people from the lower class and encouraging the marginalization of these people in a consistent manner.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental science major Nia Mitchell said her historically marginalized Afro-Cuban culture helps her understand the ongoing oppression in Israel.</p>\n<p>“I identify as Afro-Cuban and I realize that my people are and have been dominated and oppressed,” Mitchell said. “This is what happens in all lands. Therefore, it is so clear for me to see how it is impossible to take away issues like women oppression because of interconnectivity between dominance and exploitation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61431\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61431\" data-attachment-id=\"61431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/occupation_sam-aragon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the interesection of palestine and other human rights issues.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424978633\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Occupation_Sam Aragon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61431\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-1024x678.jpg?resize=365%2C242\" alt=\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the intersection of Palestine and other human rights issues.

Women have very little rights there and this will unfortunately most likely continue.”</p>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Jeremy Garza said racism exists in different forms in the U.S. and Palestine.</p>\n<p>“All forms of racism are not the same around the world. For example, we see in the Ferguson case that there is discrimination against blacks,” Garza said. “There are also a lot of African immigrants in Israel and they are not given documentation, rights, work, and are only provided with segregation.”</p>\n<p>According to Garza, African women are being sterilized in Israel because the government wants to control the population.</p>\n<p>“These women are not provided with equal rights but are being sterilized which is an example of how the government controls their people,” Garza said. “This is a tactic that the U.S. has used plenty of times in South America and with Native Americans.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Shahryar Mooraj said female immigrants in Gaza must also face sterility checkpoints and are unable to obtain medical assistance such as medicine, ambulances and local doctors.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of unfairness in Palestine, especially with the issue of sterilizing women at checkpoints. Women are being sterilized but do not get to experience medical attention and it is definitely unfair for Palestinians,” Mooraj said. “They do not have access to medical aid in Gaza which is a denial of life. There are no ambulances or speedy recoveries.”</p>\n<p>Mooraj said his immigrant lifestyle in the U.S. is much easier than the life of Palestinian immigrant because he is granted basic civil rights and allowed to travel.</p>\n<p>“I am an international student myself and cannot imagine the troubles that immigrants face in Palestine,” Mooraj said. “The restriction of movement of the Palestinian people is wrong because they have been there for years and are denied public services. I fortunately have not faced such discrimination in the U.S. so far as an immigrant student.”</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, people should be allowed to relocate and travel in their search for suitable living conditions.</p>\n<p>“At the core, this is really a human rights violation because people need to have the right to move around and find comfort,” Mooraj said. “They need to be able to grow and expand. People in Gaza and the West Bank just do not have that and I find it to be completely awful.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-61471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former RHA President Andrew Soriano tests out the new fitness equipment by on-campus residence halls. <em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Housing &amp; Residential Services and the Resident Housing Association (RHA) hosted the grand opening ceremony for the new Channel Island 5 (ChI-5) Outdoor Fitness Area located adjacent to the the Santa Cruz Residence Hall basketball courts on Friday.</p>\n<p>Students and staff came together for the ribbon-cutting of the outdoor exercise station that includes a leg press, dip bar, pull-up bar, pull-down machine and hip-flexing machine. After an approximately year-long collaborative effort between staff and students, the new station is now ready for use by resident students in the ChI-5 residence halls: Anacapa, San Miguel, San Nicholas, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and political science double major and 2013-2014 RHA President Andrew Soriano, Health &amp; Wellness Program Health Advocate Assistant Feras Maidaa brought the idea for the fitness area to him in summer 2013, after which Soriano suggested reaching out to Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP) students to form focus groups to gauge student needs.</p>\n<p>“During the [FSSP] working group, they talked about having some sort of place to work out outside,” Soriano said. “I relayed that information to housing and they took it and rolled with it. They made it happen.”</p>\n<p>Maidaa said the fitness equipment was chosen after considering feedback from the FSSP focus groups.</p>\n<p>“We made the study group, and [the students] selected the pieces of equipment that they wanted to use over here,” Maidaa said. “So this project is our students’ project — they helped us to make it happen.”</p>\n<p>Housing &amp; Residential Services Environmental &amp; Energy Programs Manager Mark Rousseau said constructing the fitness area took longer than had been originally anticipated.</p>\n<p>“We thought this would be an easy project that we could do,” Rousseau said. “Well, everything is long and slow as you know how things go in a big university. This was a wild project.”</p>\n<p>According to Maidaa, the stainless steel equipment was ordered from Norwell Outdoor Fitness in Denmark and the fitness area’s spongy turf surface was selected because it provided the best cushioning for students to feel comfortable while working out.</p>\n<p>“We definitely did a lot of research to get the best equipment and best surfacing material for this station,” Maidaa said.</p>\n<p>Maidaa said he hopes there will be more outdoor fitness areas constructed on campus for students to use to work out.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping that this is stage number one,” Maidaa said. “We are thinking about doing another station across the campus.”</p>\n<p>Soriano said the new fitness area provides students living in the on-campus residence halls more convenient access to exercise equipment.</p>\n<p>“There’s finally a pull-up bar that’s not a bike ride away,” Soriano said. “I feel like for everyone who wants to work out outside, you’re no longer cooped to the mini-gyms in like Santa Rosa or San Miguel.”</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Kyle Hordyk said he believes the fitness area was “a big waste of money” that could have been better spent elsewhere, such as refurbishing the existing basketball and volleyball courts. He also said, however, that the fitness area is a close-proximity alternative to the Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>“But for those who do plan to exercise, it makes it a lot more accessible than having to trek all the way to the Recreation Center,” Hordyk said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The second annual Dance Marathon took place on campus on Saturday night at Pavilion Gym to raise money for the Santa Barbara Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>Dance Marathon raised a total of $35,347.11 for Cottage Hospital, the local chapter of Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and exceeded its fundraising goal of $25,000. Each of 38 dance teams represented one patient from Cottage Hospital and entered after meeting the minimum entry requirements. To celebrate the funds they raised, participants engaged in a 12-hour-long dance party from noon until midnight, partaking in activities, entertainment and free food from local businesses such as Panda Express, Sorriso Italiano and Silvergreens.</p>\n<p>Event co-chair and alumnus Sean Thompson said Dance Marathon will continue to host the event in an effort to increase their fundraising goals. This year’s raised amount surpassed last year’s total of $12,791.84.</p>\n<p>“We up the ante every year,” Thompson said. “This year our goal was to double the fundraising, double the amount of people and next year, who knows?”</p>\n<p>According to co-chair of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biological science major Molly Morrison, about 400 participants raised money, an increase from last year’s 200 participants. Morrison said this is indicative of an upward trend in participation she hopes to continue.</p>\n<p>“This is the second annual event and we’re hoping to continue for generations and generations,” Morrison said. “Children’s Miracle Network nationally reached out to the UCSB campus as they were looking to extend their reach on the west coast. They came to UCSB and we’re here now.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said Dance Marathon began in 1991 at Indiana University in honor of Ryan White, a student who was expelled from his middle school in 1984 after being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. The event was then adopted by Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. According to Morrison, dance marathons are now held on over 250 campuses nationwide with participants staying and dancing for a full 12 hours without sitting down to show support for hospitalized children.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we are standing for the kids that can’t,” Morrison said. “The people who really want to stay for the kids stay the whole time.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61465\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61465\" data-attachment-id=\"61465\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/dance-marathon-members-engaged-in-a-zumba-session/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425082645\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance marathon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61465\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session.

We can get together and feel like we can help donate and have a good time together at the same time.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_61473\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"216681619\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61473\" data-attachment-id=\"61473\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/dance-marathon_alex-gonzalez-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425172318\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-61473\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Dance Marathon raised a total of $35,347.11.  <em>Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/","id":2859,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[2858,2857,2856],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
