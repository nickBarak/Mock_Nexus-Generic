In the first game of the day, RHP Chris Clements pitched phenomenally for UCSB.  Clements would do a fantastic job establishing pitches on the inside part of the plate to the primarily right-handed hitting line-up. Through the first five, Clements was cruising.</p>\n<p>As heartless baseball is sometimes, his hard work through those innings would be somewhat tarnished with a rough top of the sixth.  Still, although giving up four consecutive two out hits to Aggie hitters that would allow three earned runs, Clements stuff and command wise looked the best it has been in a while.</p>\n<p>In the sixth, the Aggie hitters caught on to the first pitch fastball pattern Clements was falling into and took advantage of it.  Clements would eventually get the loss by giving up three earned runs off nine hits, but would finish with six innings pitched while striking out five. Without that last inning, Clements would have pitched a gem.</p>\n<p>In the second game, true freshman Chris Lincoln looked like a future Gaucho ace after settling down from a shaky third inning in which he gave up two runs. The former 13<sup>th</sup> round pick for the Cleveland Indians in last year’s draft, had scary big league stuff on the mound. Lincoln’s fastball was electric as usually, but his slider and change up were simply something to truly marvel at.</p>\n<p>The only thing holding the 6’4, 175 lb. freshman back are control issues with the fastball and slider. Lincoln’s stuff plays so well at a Division 1 level though, that on days where he does not have his control, he is still dominant which he let all see Saturday in his start. Lincoln would have his longest outing of the season in his second start Saturday, going five IP, with six Ks and two ER.</p>\n<p>Another thing to not ignore, the bullpen did a great job shutting down UC Davis as well. In the double header, bullpen relief threw seven innings of scoreless baseball. Stephen Ledesma had one inning that could have been a disaster, but he kept his composure and got out of the jam. Ledesma would do more than asked by striking out four through three innings only giving up one hit.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, Sam Cohen was the bright spot in game one of the double header. Although going 0 for 3 in the second game, Cohen would go 2 for 2 with a majestic, high towering solo shot to right in game one of the double header, game two of the series. Cohen now has seven homers on the year.</p>\n<p>Now the negative: without sugar coating it, the Gauchos simply could not hit Saturday in both contests. The UCSB Offense has been strong through the majority of the season, with having an impressive .278 team batting average (2<sup>nd</sup> best in the Big West Conference) coming into yesterday’s double-header.</p>\n<p>Still, with the offense doing as well as it has been, UCSB bats did not show up.  Due to an abandonment of their opposite-field, watch the off-speed deep approach, the Gaucho bats were sat down all day long. When the ball was hit the other way, it was weakly hit which is something not seen to often from UCSB.</p>\n<p>UC Davis starters, RHP Justin Mullins and LHP Robert Garcia pecked away on the outside part of the plate all day long to UCSB with great control. Gaucho hitters could not make the adjustment though. Against Mullins in the first game of the double header, the Gauchos would strike out four times while collecting six hits, all singles but the Sam Cohen home run. Mullins final bylines would be 6.2 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 3 BB while improving to 2-3 on the year.</p>\n<p>Lefty Garcia, who is a candidate for Big West Pitcher of the Week, threw a complete game shutout while striking out 11 UCSB batters. Even though UCSB Head Coach Andrew Checketts threw in a righty line up to face the lefty, the Gauchos could not figure out the Aggie game two starter. Garcia’s off-speed had sliding movement with 12 to 6 action, which, when paired with pinpoint fastball control, had Gauchos guessing, lunging, and out in front all game long. Garcia, now 2-5 this season, only gave up two hits to Gauchos.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the double header, Coach Checketts commented on the day. “It looked like it wasn’t going to be an easy day to hit from the get go. The wind was howling in, unless you hit it in that kind of window in right field, it had a chance to blow.”</p>\n<p>On Garcia, Checketts tipped his cap. “I think their guy did a nice job and we didn’t do a good job enough of adjusting.” Checketts continued, “Their guy (Garcia) filled up the strike zone the second game. We had some chances but really couldn’t deliver any kind of blow, but our pitchers did a nice job of keeping us in there.”</p>\n<p>After this series loss, UCSB baseball is 6-9 in the Big West conference. Officially, the Gauchos will not have a chance to make a run for another run for a college World Series appearance. Although the 2017 season has been a disappointing one for Santa Barbara baseball fans, the future does look bright for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Freshman stars such as Armani Smith, Tommy Jew, Shea Barry, and Chris Lincoln have shown sky high potential this year. Moving forward, expect Andrew Checketts to start experimenting more with younger players and the line up to see where guys will fit next season.</p>\n<p>UCSB baseball now has just 12 games left on the schedule: eight away games, four home games. Tuesday, the ‘Chos will head to St. Mary’s to face the Gales at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-08/double-downer-gauchos-drop-double-header-to-lose-series-vs-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-08/double-downer-gauchos-drop-double-header-to-lose-series-vs-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-08/double-downer-gauchos-drop-double-header-to-lose-series-vs-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-08/double-downer-gauchos-drop-double-header-to-lose-series-vs-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-08/double-downer-gauchos-drop-double-header-to-lose-series-vs-uc-davis/","id":4257,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

However, the construction was delayed until August, Lebell said.</p>\n<p>About 30 members of the I.V. community were in attendance at the grand opening, alongside four IVRPD Board members, including Pegeen Soutar and Matias Eusterbrock. Both worked alongside Lebell during the construction process.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD made several changes to the park in order to made it dog-compatible, including securing the perimeter with fences and altering the landscape to make it a safer space, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“[The IVRPD] secur[ed] the fence in the back and [ran] a fence in the front with a double gate, as well as a vehicle access gate, and then we took out all of the rubber multrain on the place structure and replaced it with wood chips,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>The board hopes to add several more features to the park, including sprinklers, tables, an additional mutt mitt dispenser, a tunnel bridge, ramps and slides, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the biggest setback the IVRPD faced in establishing the park was “finding the right park that would work… having enough space and [finding] a neighborhood it wouldn’t be a problem in.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD initially planned to create the dog park in Anisq’Oyo Park. However, it was found unsuitable due to incompatible aspects of the terrain, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>With the growing population of dogs in I.V., concerns with the safety of residents has risen, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD is providing a dog training course that is free and accessible to all residents in I.V. The board is working with Jeike Meijer, Associated Students external vice president of local affairs, to help fund this program.</p>\n<p>The dog training courses will be every Sunday at 11 a.m. at Sueno Park, beginning on Oct. 21. A trainer from “Four on the Floor,” a locally based training company, will teach the dogs a basic set of behaviors.</p>\n<p>The training course’s’ main objective is to “help students afford an opportunity to train their dogs and also have a better relationship with their dog,” Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>In addition to the training courses, the board would like to work with Progressive Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.), a national charitable organization, to offer a mobile health van that provides dogs with medical resources such as vaccinations, spaying and neutering.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the board hopes to “build a community around dogs in I.V.” that helps foster a welcoming environment, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Wolf contributed reporting.</em></p><div

individual blasts from freshman Armani Smith and sophomore Sam Cohen in the third. But from the third inning on, the Gauchos created not so much as one hit.</p>\n<p>Starting on the hill for Santa Barbara was junior LHP Kyle Nelson (6-4, 4.88 ERA) who struck out five but allowed eight runs over five and two-thirds innings to take the loss.</p>\n<p>The first of the Titans eight runs was scored in the bottom of the first when junior center fielder Scott Hurst doubled to right center, advanced to third on a wild pitch, and went home on a throwing error from UCSB catcher Dempsey Grover.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless second inning from both teams and the two homers from Smith and Cohen in the top of the third to make it 4-1 Gauchos, Hurst got himself another RBI in the bottom of the inning with a single up the middle to score junior left fielder Chris Prescott. CSF Freshman Sahid Valenzuela then followed with a shot to left to score him and Hurst, tying it 4-4.</p>\n<p>Innings four and five were entirely scoreless as well, but the Titans broke the even score wide open in the bottom of the sixth to bring in four more.</p>\n<p>Fullerton senior shortstop Timmy Richards had the go-ahead RBI single to left, plating junior first baseman Dillon Persinger. Then junior catcher Chris Hudgins stepped up with two outs and went deep with a three-run homer to add some insurance.</p>\n<p>This carried the Titans to a victory, as the score remained 8-4 from the last out of the sixth all the way through the ninth after Nelson was relieved by junior RHP Steven Ledesma (1-5, 5.77 ERA), who was then followed by freshman RHP Liam Steigerwald (0-0, 0.00 ERA).</p>\n<p>Ace Noah Davis is returning to UCSB’s rotation, after having been out on injury, for Saturday evening’s game at 7 p.m. which will be aired live on FOX Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have the potential to win this series and damage Cal State Fullerton’s chances at locking down a region bid with Cal Poly still just one game behind the Titans in Big West standings, but they will need to find some inspiration at the plate to do so.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77851\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77851\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/","id":4255,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4254,4253,4252],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"There’s No Place Quite Like Sweet Jane","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-photo-1-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-photo-1-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In addition to the myriad of costume-esque clothing and accessory options, Sweet Jane sells birthday supplies, festival clothes and Isla Vista-specific merchandise.

But over the past 13 years, it has grown to become the Halloween hub of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the myriad of costume-esque clothing and accessory options, Sweet Jane sells birthday supplies, festival clothes and Isla Vista-specific merchandise — like “U Can Study Buzzed” shot glasses and Isla Vista flags, various bongs and pipes and sunglasses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve never raised the prices on our sunglasses,” owner Stella Termin added, waving toward the towering display by the cash register. “They’ve always been buy-one-get-one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Sweet Jane is known for its costume- and festival-ready inventory, students flock to the boutique at all times of the year, drawn in by the boutique’s unique Isla Vista college town vibes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I keep hearing it over and over again, ‘I love this store, I want everything in here,’ and it’s like yeah, this is the store where you want everything you don’t probably need,” Termin laughed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s just because [the store is] unusual.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having been a small business owner in I.V. for so long, Termin has seen how the culture of the college town has changed as students roll through it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, Termin said she sold a lot of clothes and jewelry with peace signs. “The kids were into revolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never bought anything in camo or anything, and all of a sudden they started having camouflage parties,” she said. “I can see that there’s a difference — there’s a big difference.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Termin attributes the change in culture in I.V. to the rise of social media, pointing to the Facebook event for Floatopia in 2009 that drew over 12,000 people to I.V.’s beaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were actually on the sand; we were giving out water,” Termin said. “Let me tell you — I’ve never seen so many people on that beach.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took a half an hour just to get up and down the [beach] stairs; you couldn’t walk anywhere without stepping on a bottle or a can,” she added. “All the recycling people, the families, it was like their Black Friday.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Had that not been posted on Facebook, we could have maybe still had, at least for a few more years, some real Floatopia,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of sad, ‘cause I see things change, you know, since when I first started.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just in the past few years, Termin has seen many I.V. businesses come and go — she named Firehouse Subs, Giovanni’s Pizza Restaurant and 212° Hotpot, which closed recently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that while some of the rent prices may seem doable at first sight, businesses have to consider the weeks or months during which students vacate Isla Vista, like over the summer or winter break. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a continuum,” she said. “I’ve been lucky, knock on wood, because I was able to strategize and realize what I needed to do — I don’t know how — what I needed to do to be able to provide for what Isla Vista needed and wanted and to have fun.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90861\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90861\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90861\" data-attachment-id=\"90861\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/theres-no-place-quite-like-sweet-jane/sweet-jane-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1362\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sweet jane 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90861\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sweet-jane-2-.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alaska Yokota / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the high rents in Isla Vista, Termin added that there are a handful of licenses and taxes that she has to pay every year that make running a small business more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that they would give smaller businesses, especially those in seasonal, this type of environment, more tax breaks and more of tax initiatives, instead of pounding us over the head as businesses that make over half a million dollars a year,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Sweet Jane’s success, Termin said she thinks she has been around long enough to be able to maintain her level of business through word of mouth and the fact that most of her prices are cheaper than Amazon’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just think it’s being nice, treating your customers well, understanding what they need, put a smile on your face and be lucky,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweet Jane has rooted itself in the community, particularly through a handful of fun traditions. During the interview, Termin was ringing up students and noticed that one student was purchasing items for a birthday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Is it a birthday?” she asked. The student said yes, and Termin pulled out a box of buttons and stacks of cups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to pick a birthday mug and free birthday button,” Termin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really?” the student said. “These are so cute!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s fun,” Termin said afterward. “They get excited, because birthdays are big deals, whether they’re yours or somebody else’s.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the birthday cup tradition, Sweet Jane creates new sticker designs every month that the store gives out for free. Another student at the register fawned over the newest design, telling Termin that she had all of the most recent ones and that they were her favorites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Termin lived at the far end of Trigo Road for a few years in the ‘90s with a then-boyfriend, it wasn’t until a friend brought her here in 2006 that she really saw Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just nice, over the years, to see the road the store has been on and the different people that have passed through here. So many students have worked here, and it’s great,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Sweet Jane is well loved, and that makes me very, very proud and happy. It means I did something right.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the October 31 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
