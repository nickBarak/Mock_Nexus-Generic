The current Big West Player of the Week finished with 29 points, 16 rebounds and four assists despite FGCU playing tough defense and using multiple defenders to guard him.</p>\n<p>Junior guard John Green came off the bench and was the second-leading scorer on the night for Santa Barbara with 17 points. Green was effective on both sides of the court, making big buckets and drawing offensive fouls on defense before fouling out.</p>\n<p>The game was tight for most of the second half with both sides sharing the lead. FGCU began the half looking to extend its 32-28 first half advantage and were effective coming out of the half. Yet, the Gauchos went on a 7-0 run to close the gap after junior guard Michael Bryson knocked down a corner three-pointer on a skip pass from Williams.</p>\n<p>From there on, the Gauchos clamped down defensively and closed down driving lanes to set up the close finish before going into overtime with the score tied at 64.</p>\n<p>It was in overtime where the Eagles began taking control of the game. FGCU took advantage of fouls committed by UCSB and converted from the charity stripe to gain separation. With 27 seconds left to play, the Eagles were winning 77-74 after a made free throw by sophomore guard Eric Childress. Despite the attempted comeback, the rally fell short as FGCU made its free throw attempts and controlled the boards in the period.</p>\n<p>Williams was limited to only one basket in OT as the big man played with more caution after picking up his fourth foul. Foul trouble, as in the previous game, plagued the Gauchos. Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent were forced to sit parts of the game after getting into early foul trouble.</p>\n<p>Another area concern for the Gauchos was in the three-point shooting category. Santa Barbara shot only 22 percent from behind the arc, going a total of 5-23 on the night.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, senior guard Brett Comer was just as dynamic as Williams on the offensive end, finishing with 28 points to lead the Eagles.</p>\n<p>After two games on the road to start the season, UCSB returns home for its first regular season matchup at the Thunderdome. The team will face The Master’s College on Saturday as it looks to get back into the win column.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

The 6’8” center got her team off to a great start, making her first five shots as Nevada was off to an early 16-4 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB kept itself in the game behind a balanced scoring attack, with junior guard Jasmine Ware eventually cutting the Wolf Pack’s lead to 23-21 off a jumpshot with 5:45 remaining in the first half. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, this was the closest they would come to taking the lead.</p>\n<p>Nevada continued to hold UCSB off for most of the game, eventually pushing its lead to 58-44 on the team’s only three-pointer of the night by Terilyn Moe with 5:41 left in the second half. The junior guard complemented Mungedi superbly from start to finish, tallying 19 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists on her way to the first triple-double in program history.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to make one final push, eventually cutting the lead to 63-58 off a triple by freshman guard Makala Roper with just over two minutes remaining. However, they were unable to score another basket as the Wolf Pack closed the game on an 8-0 run to win 71-58.</p>\n<p>Another strong contributor for Nevada was junior forward Nyasha LeSure, who recorded a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds on an efficient 6-9 shooting night. The dominant Mungedi ended the game with 24 points, nine boards and four blocks on a near-perfect 11-13 shooting.</p>\n<p>While four players scored in double-digits for UCSB, an inefficient 19-68 from the field held them back for most of the night. Senior center Clair Watkins nearly recorded a double-double with 10 points to go along with eight rebounds, and Roper impressed off the bench to score a team-high 11 points on 3-5 shooting from downtown in her first career game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s attention tonight shifts to its next opponent in the University of Idaho. The Vandals continue a three-game west coast trip to open up their season after they lost their season opener to Cal State Northridge, 67-50.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Stacey Barr looks to be the focal point for Idaho’s offense, coming off a game in which she recorded team-highs with 18 points and 11 rebounds on 7-24 shooting. Junior guard Christina Salvatore and freshman post Geraldine McCorkell also chipped in with nine and 10 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will be played in honor of longtime UCSB women’s basketball supporter Renee Trenholm, who passed away in May. Trenholm was the president of the Fastbreakers, a grassroots support group for the women’s basketball team, for over 15 years. The players will be wearing patches on their uniforms in memory of her contributions to the program on and off the court over the years.</p>\n<p>The game with Idaho is set to tip off tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58345\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58345\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/","id":505,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[504,503,502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Clinches No. 4 Seed in Big West Tourney With Blue-Green Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-12.43.03-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-12.43.03-PM.png?resize=980%2C522&ssl=1","description":"For the second consecutive year, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the UCSB women's basketball team will be playing for the Big West title.

It’s all or nothing now, the momentum we have from this game will hopefully roll over to the next.”</p>\n<p>In one of the game’s most critical moments, it was Jemerigbe’s made three-pointer with nearly six minutes left in the game that prevented a surging Cal Poly team from possibly completing a comeback.</p>\n<p>Along with Jemerigbe, both senior forward Mi’Chael Wright and senior center Melissa Maragnes were celebrated for Senior Night.</p>\n<p>Shifting the game in Santa Barbara’s advantage were runs to close the first half and open the second before Cal Poly embarked on its fourth quarter comeback, cutting the Gauchos lead to six before coming up short.</p>\n<p>It was a highly energized atmosphere inside the Thunderdome with conference tournament seeding at stake. Nonetheless, both teams traded baskets in reflection of the game’s intense pace.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead which included a basket by junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, who scored a game-high 24 points but could never establish any consistency as she shot 9-of-22 and 4-of-10 from long range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck with a balanced attack, first going to redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman in the paint, then from behind the three-point line with redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter for a 5-4 lead. It was a start that led to a 15-3 run that before Lynn Leaupepe scored five-straight points to end the quarter as Cal Poly trailed 15-12.</p>\n<p>Porter continued to warm up from deep with two three-pointers in the first to minutes of the second quarter. The Gauchos’ shooter scored eight of the team’s first 10 points.</p>\n<p>It was Porter’s most productive period as she tallied 10 of her 13 points during the period, and ended the game 4-of-7 from the field and 3-of-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Yet, tying the game at 25 apiece with a three-pointer was junior guard/forward Mary Kate Evans for her only field goal off the bench.</p>\n<p>The tie wouldn’t last long once UCSB put together its 12-3 run before halftime. Half of the Gauchos points were scored at the free-throw line. Also responsible for half of the points lodged was Jemerigbe as her two made free-throws handed UCSB a 37-28 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>With momentum already going UCSB’s way, the opening minutes of the third quarter belonged solely to the Gauchos as they constructed a 16-6 run.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch began with the draining of a three-pointer by Jemerigbe to give UCSB its first double-figure lead of the game at 40-30.</p>\n<p>Helping Cal Poly chip at the Gauchos’ lead was senior forward Hannah Gilbert as she scored seven points and went a perfect 3-of-3 from the field in the quarter. Overall, Gilbert shot 50 percent (5-of-10) and ended the game with 12 points, four rebounds, one block, and one steal.</p>\n<p>But Santa Barbara’s scoring outburst proved to be too much as its bench emerged as well. The combination of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler’s drive and kick ability along with freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez’ perimeter shooting helped run up the score on UCSB’s end.</p>\n<p>The two scored six apiece, and it was Hernandez’ made three-pointer at the 4:17 mark of the third that gave UCSB a 53-34 lead as it seemed destined to route its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>Toler finished with 15 points and a game-high seven assists, while Hernandez ended with six points.</p>\n<p>Despite its 19-point deficit, Cal Poly still showed signs trying to curtail UCSB’s growing lead. Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe complemented her sister’s scoring with seven-straight points during the third quarter but it would not be enough still. Her final results to the game were 16 points and five rebounds while going 7-of-16, 2-of-4 from long distance.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to hold the sisters to inefficient shooting nights was key in its defense holding Cal Poly to percentages of 38.5 from the field and 35 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“We held them to 40, they had 55 last time. Good heavens they’re good. There’s not much you can do with a midrange game,” Henrickson explained. “We tried to keep them on one side of the floor.

It set the stage for their dominant start to the game’s final 10 minutes as they then went on a 9-2 run, bringing its deficit to 64-58 with 6:08 remaining following steal and made layup by Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>With UCSB’s lead being jeaopardized, Jemerigbe prevailed with a three-pointer to give UCSB some comfort. Regaining the Gauchos’ double-figure lead of 69-58 was a made layup by Toler.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB scored one last field goal and scored the remainder of its points at the free-throw line where it finished 19-of-26.</p>\n<p>Ending the season at home and with a two-game winning streak is momentous for a Gaucho team preparing for March Madness beginning with the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Wednesday against the remaining highest seed at 8:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/ucsb-clinches-no-4-seed-in-big-west-tourney-with-blue-green-victory/","id":506,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[505,504,503],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Uncharted Destiny: Toler & Porter Find Best Fit in UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-17-at-1.53.31-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Any amount of time spent away from a sport is one of the most difficult experiences a student-athlete can endure.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Despite being California natives, Toler from Inglewood and Porter from San Diego, the decision to pack things up and come to Santa Barbara was not a simple sign-and-release process.</p>\n<p>As roommates and members of the Gauchos’ backcourt, Toler and Porter both sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules.</p>\n<p>According to <em>ncaa.org</em>, “Under the basic transfer regulations, you must spend an academic year in residence at the school to which you are transferring.”</p>\n<p>Both players redshirted last season, giving Toler her current redshirt junior status while Porter still has two years remaining as a redshirt sophomore.</p>\n<p>Toler transferred from the University of Oregon, while Porter spent her first year of her collegiate career at the University of Mississippi, but this doesn’t tell all about their past experiences.</p>\n<p>Although both could participate in team practices and dress for play, the regulation prohibited the two from playing during the regular season and postseason, leaving them anxious and eager on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Toler expressed that it “was beneficial in being able to learn, but tough in being limited to only cheering for teammates and not being able to actually play.”</p>\n<p>Expressing similar sentiments to her teammate, Porter assured that although it was a learning experience it was also “bittersweet because of the inability to play the game I love.”</p>\n<p>Before making the transition to UCSB, the start to each of their careers was not a structured beginning when looking back at their recruiting experiences.</p>\n<p>The recruiting process can be one full of clouded judgment as the constant phone calls, visits and promises can either enhance or deter one from making the most suitable decision.</p>\n<p>The current state of the recruitment process has been shifted over the years as out-of-state universities now make more of an effort to recruit student athletes from all over the country. The response to the search has been kind as players are intrigued by the thought of a change in scenery.</p>\n<p>Even so, this change hasn’t always warranted a promising outcome. It tends to only scratch the surface, showing what’s most appealing to the eye, sometimes leading student athletes to make questionable decisions.</p>\n<p>Although Toler ended up staying on the West Coast for her first two years of college, the journey to becoming a duck wasn’t a pre-determined destination.</p>\n<p>“Coming out of high school was hard. When I first came out, I actually committed to Sarah’s school, Ole Miss. It was the first school I went to and I just committed without knowing too much about it. I feel like that was more of a freshman thing to do.”</p>\n<p>The period of uncertainty led to Toler’s eventual commitment to Oregon. A change in head coaches between her freshman and sophomore seasons, however, influenced her decision to leave the school.</p>\n<p>Despite her undersized frame, Toler’s speed, ability to drive and court vision were each areas of her game which she believed UCSB catered to, making this the next best school for her.</p>\n<p>“Once I came [to UCSB], it was different because I knew what to look for [regarding] the coaching, type of system and what the school offered academic-wise,” Toler said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a coveted high school career helped build up Porter’s reputation, who became well-known for her scoring ability, as she left Horizon Christian Academy as a member of its 1,000-point club with 1,292 points.</p>\n<p>“I actually originally committed to Fresno State coming out of high school, but the coaches left, so I reopened my recruiting process,” Porter explained. “Ole Miss sounded amazing to me, [but] I kind of went blind into the situation because I didn’t know the coaches that well, which is why it ended up not working out.”</p>\n<p>In the cases of Toler and Porter, it is plausible that the prestige of each of their former universities being within Power Five conferences set the stage for where they thought their future resided.</p>\n<p>After beginning the season on the bench, Porter’s consistency as the Gauchos’ go-to shooter helped land her within the starting lineup as a stretch guard/forward.</p>\n<p>“The third time around, I knew what I wanted to look for,” Porter said. “I wanted to come to a school where I felt comfortable with the coaching staff, the academics were good and they had everything they needed to offer me.”</p>\n<p>Following the end of last season, in which only three seniors graduated, it was a wonder as to how exactly either player would fit into a team with four of its starters returning.</p>\n<p>Understanding that there are no guarantees, especially pertaining to the court, Toler and Porter have certainly answered any concerns prior to entering this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping UCSB capture the No. 4 seed and a first-round bye in the Big West Tournament, each player confirmed the anticipation that surrounded them following their redshirt seasons.</p>\n<p>Toler ended the regular season tied for the conference lead in assists per game with a 4.4 average. Primarily coming off the bench, Toler finished atop the Big West in assists per 40 minutes at 8.3 as well. She also ranked second-best on the team in scoring in conference games at 10.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Porter was another valuable piece as her three-point shooting led to her being one of the top perimeter shooters in the Big West. Her 38.1 three-point percentage during the regular season ranked seventh. Most notably, she placed third in the conference in total three-pointers made with 61, which currently ranks sixth most in a single-season in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>It was unfortunate that the two were forced to sit out during the hype of the hiring of Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. The process was a waiting game, but once that clock expired, the focus returned to helping revive the UCSB women’s basketball program in hopes of winning a conference championship.</p>\n<p>Still, while returning to basketball was the ultimate goal, both expressed the importance of earning their degrees, improving during the offseason and simply continuing playing the game they’ve always dreamt about excelling in.</p>\n<p>As a byproduct of their hard work, Toler and Porter knew they had the potential to thrive at the collegiate level, but it took the right fit in their choice of school to help make that a reality.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76327\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76327\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/uncharted-destiny-toler-porter-find-best-fit-in-ucsb/","id":507,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[506,505,504],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
