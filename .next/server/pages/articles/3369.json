The bill will require a two-thirds vote from the student body during the upcoming spring elections to be implemented; if it passes, the seats will be added to the 72nd Senate for the 2021-2022 school year, not the incoming 71st Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, the bill was written with the intention of replacing one off-campus senator seat with one international student seat to ensure Associated Students (A.S.) Senate remained at an odd number. Keeping the Senate at even numbers would give the internal vice president a significant amount of power if a tie-breaking vote was held, a concern that both Ferguson and Swanson expressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the bill was amended during the Senate’s Jan. 22 meeting to increase the number of international student senator seats from one to two, instead of removing an off-campus senator seat.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Based off of the statistics I was hearing, I didn’t understand why we were only adding one senator and decreasing representation for other students,” Kimia Hadidi, the off-campus senator who proposed amending the bill, said during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was amended and passed after a lengthy discussion in which some senators, such as On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman, expressed concern over the potential decrease in off-campus senators. He further discussed how the bill could possibly open the doors to other groups on campus asking for Senate seats designated specifically for them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus after the meeting, Foreman expressed worry that “the Flying A Room can only fit so many people,” and that if more seats were to be added, the Senate should find a way to restructure itself as to ensure that it can still logistically function with a larger governing body.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the Senate is composed of: five on-campus senator seats, 12 off-campus senator seats, six representatives at large, one university-owned housing representative and a transfer student senator.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant amount of support for the bill came from international student groups, such as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA). According to the UCSB 2018-19 campus profile, 12% of all UCSB undergraduates are international students, and 73% of international students at UCSB are from China. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB undergraduates, including international students, pay student fees which go toward funding for entities such as A.S. For the 2018-19 school year, UCSB undergraduates each paid </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,854</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in these student fees, according to the UCSB Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships; in the same school year, the A.S. Senate received just under </span><a href=\"https://budget.as.ucsb.edu/files/2018/05/budget18-19.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$12.5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> million in student fees. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating an international student senator [seat] can definitely allow us to have a say in how the money is distributed and make sure that our money is used well and fairly,” Hanrui Feng, vice president of the CSSA, said during the meeting.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international student has never sat on the A.S. Senate at UCSB, but the bill notes that other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles and UC San Diego, have “equivalent” roles for international students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My hope is that this will contribute to expanding crucial opportunities for international students in A.S.,” said Charles Neumann, the internal chair of the A.S. Global Gaucho Commission and one of the bill’s 20 student sponsors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann added that he considers an international student senator crucial to “breaking down social barriers between international students and domestics, and a path forward in addressing these previously overlooked crucial interests.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reviewing what the UC Title IX office has done over the past six years, a panel of individuals working in the UC Systemwide Title IX department and on specific

have increased significantly since we put the [Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment] policy in place in 2016, and [the state auditor] connected that increase to better training and student outreach

This set number of swipes expires at the end of each week and cannot be used for the weeks following. In Ferguson and Mitchell’s resolution, the two argue that meal swipes should expire at the end of each quarter, rather than each week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal, as detailed in the resolution, would allow meal swipes to be used throughout the quarter rather than expire each Sunday after dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In order to make full use of student meal plans, there needs to be amendments to how meal plan swipes can be used, by whom, and when they expire,” the resolution reads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states that students with 17 meal swipes per week or fewer should be able to swipe guests into the dining commons with their own meal swipes, rather than be charged a $12 fee for each guest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the UCSB Housing </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/dining/offcampus-mealplan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a standard 14 meals per week costs $1,532 per quarter. Students who choose to live in the dorms are mandated to buy a meal plan, the cost of which is added in with their housing expenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a lower-income, first-generation, queer college student, I understand the struggles of not knowing when your next meal may come sometimes. I couldn’t afford a meal plan this year because of how expensive they are,” Ferguson said in Wednesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution supports several other modifications to the current meal plan rules, namely removing the cap on how many meals students may donate to the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank each week, which is currently at a maximum of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the resolution, the A.S. Food Bank had already been working with Executive Director of Campus Dining Jill Horst to try to implement a policy to allow students to donate more of their meal swipes per week, according to Eric Nava, the Food Bank’s student coordinator and fourth-year religious studies major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with Jill to try to raise this cap for about three years now and the process has been very stagnant,” Nava said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nava said the A.S. Food Bank staff supports the resolution and is hopeful that the added support of the Senate position can help them meet their goals in raising or abolishing the current donation cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue isn’t just about accessibility, but also about waste, specifically a waste of money. When something is paid for, it should remain in the system and be reused for students who need those swipes,” said Soha Sadeghinejad, the student sponsor of the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this isn’t the first time meal rollovers have been discussed. Ferguson referred to similar demands made in 2006, when a survey showing support for meal rollover was presented to the UCSB Dining Services director, the Housing &amp; Residential Services executive director and the Residential Housing Association president, citing a previous </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2006-04-04/survey-results-heat-up-debate-over-possible-meal-rollover-system/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In 2006, On-Campus Senator Nathaniel Wood-Wilde presented a survey to RHA showing that a majority of students supported a meal swipe rollover policy. The RHA were ‘considering the implementation of rollovers in student meal plans’ and were ‘definitely interested to see what works best for students,’” Ferguson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Food insecurity is no joke; it’s a big issue on college campuses, and this resolution is another step in the right direction. Students desperately want change, and through advocacy and support we can make that change a reality,” Sadeghinejad said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 28, 5:23 p.m.] </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/","id":3368,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3367,3366,3365],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
