The Assembly’s Local Governance Committee will now determine whether it will be submitted to the full Assembly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said if the Assembly’s Local Governance Committee approves of the bill in the hearing next week, the legislation will continue on the path to be officiated by October of this year.</p>\n<p>“The hearing next week will determine if the bill moves on to full assembly or not,” Abboud said in an email. “If it does, we are still on schedule to pass the bill by October if everything continues to go smoothly.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double-major Cameron Schunk said the bill’s inclusion of a Utilities User Tax (UUT), which allows the CSD to apply a tax on utilities such as water, electricity and gas, will potentially raise the most issues in the hearing next week.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Isla Vista’s situation is so unique. The Utilities User Tax provides an option for the district to fit the taxation needs of I.V. – A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>The bill’s supporters have yet to complete a financial feasibility report to determine whether such a tax is necessary, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“I think that the fear and contention is around the fact that we’re putting this forward before a financial feasibility report,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the UUT is necessary for a CSD in I.V. because it is home to a majority of renters and short-term residents.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista’s situation is so unique,” Schunk said. “The Utilities User Tax provides an option for the district to fit the taxation needs of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jason Garshfield said he believes legislators will not take AB 3 seriously because it lacks community support.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t something that a lot of people seem to be pushing for,” Garshfield said in an email. “I think we might not get support from the state because I.V. hasn’t really proved itself to be a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he is “cautiously optimistic” the bill will pass despite the possible controversy surrounding the inclusion of the UUT, though the effort will require the support of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“We need to show local support for the unique solutions we’ve put in the bill, like the Utilities User Tax,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, if the bill is killed in the hearing, the establishment of I.V. self-governance may be delayed until the 2020s.</p>\n<p>“If [AB 3] doesn’t pass, this would have to be a two-year bill and therefore there won’t be a chance at I.V. self-governance until 2018 at the very earliest, or probably not until the 2020’s,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If [AB 3] doesn’t pass, this would have to be a two-year bill and therefore there won’t be a chance at I.V. self-governance until 2018 at the very earliest, or probably not until the 2020’s. – SBCC Trustee Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said the end of AB 3 would mean the introduction of alternative solutions to Isla Vista “self-determination,” such as pushing the county or university to provide funding or support instead of establishing a CSD.</p>\n<p>“At that point, which I consider to be the unwanted scenario, my and other activists’ efforts will have to become focused on pursuing our community’s right to self-determination through other means,” Schunk said in an email. “Those other means, in many cases, have very little real authority and can do very little at addressing the underlying issues in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he is renting a 12-person van to transport AB 3 supporters next Tuesday evening to Sacramento to lobby for the Wednesday hearing and demonstrate Isla Vista’s support for AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Anyone is welcome to come,” Schunk said in an email. “The broader the community support, the more powerful our sentiment will be.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he is fully prepared to “eat his words” if the bill passes and will be happy to have some form of self-governance in I.V. even if it is not the independent cityhood he prefers.</p>\n<p>“I’d be happy to see some form of I.V. self-governance come into effect during my time as a student here,” Garshfield said in an email. “I just think that AB 3 is a half measure that still leaves us under the partial jurisdiction of the county.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Law enforcement officials are currently investigating whether the disturbance was drug related.</p>\n<p>According to the report, both victims sustained what is “characterized to be gunshot wounds” from a handgun found at the scene. Both victims are being treated at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and are expected to recover from their injuries. The third patient at the hospital was confirmed to be Taylor, who sustained head wounds from the incident that do not appear to be life threatening.</p>\n<p>A short while after the altercation on Sabado Tarde, a Hispanic male arrived at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital with injuries he claimed were sustained during a vehicle accident on the UCSB campus. The man was transferred to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital due to the nature of his injuries and confirmed to be Gutierrez.</p>\n<p>Both Taylor and Guitierrez are under police custody but will remain in the hospital due to their injuries until they can be released. Taylor is booked on charges of Attempted Murder, Robbery, Discharge of a firearm in the commission of a felony causing great bodily injury, and Participation in a Criminal Street Gang. Gutierrez is booked on charges of Attempted Murder, Robbery, Possession of a Stolen Firearm, Participating in a Criminal Street Gang and Discharge of a firearm in the commission of a felony causing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p>SBCSO Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the shooting “triggers” emotions given the one-year anniversary of the events of <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064422\"><span class=\"aQJ\">May 23</span></span> is less than two weeks away.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, everybody out here right now is very sensitive right now, coming on heels of the one-year anniversary, just the thought of anyone being injured out here in Isla Vista, I think, just makes everyone’s heart sink,” Hoover said. “So there is definitely great concern on behalf of the public. We’re getting lots of calls — a lot of people very, very worried.”</p>\n<p>Hoover said while it is uncertain whether <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064423\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Monday’s</span></span> shooting is connected to the three armed robberies that took place last week, law enforcement has reason to believe there is a connection between the robberies that occurred on May 3 and May 4.</p>\n<p>“At this point, that is all under investigation. It’s likely there is a relation between definitely the alleged victim, who also later was arrested,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated as of 6:39 p.m. on May 12, 2015.</em></p>\n<div

3\" width=\"170\" height=\"214\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59588\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr was one of two commissioners to oppose the motion against AB 3</p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) voted Thursday to oppose Assembly Bill 3, Assemblymember Das Williams’ initiative for Isla Vista self-governance through a Community Services District (CSD), unless amended to include the commission in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>LAFCO met in the in the Board of Supervisors room in Santa Maria, where it voted to oppose AB 3 five-to-two. The bill’s current language circumvents the LAFCO process by stating the CSD and its funding mechanism, a Utility Users Tax (UUT), will be ratified by a vote of its potential residents.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Vice Chair Doreen Farr and public comment participants spoke in favor of AB 3, while other commissioners said it does not sufficiently clarify the role of UC Santa Barbara, the CSD’s boundaries and the district’s financial feasibility, especially for funding special approval elections.</p>\n<p>Long term I.V. resident and UCSB Economics Lecturer Lanney Ebenstein said he has lived in I.V. since 1961 and, despite the costs, believes a CSD is the “best opportunity” for I.V. he has seen in his time in the community.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista has unique issues — both as board compensation and funding — that make state legislation necessary,” Ebenstein said. “There is no question that it would be an expense to the county, but, in the long run, I believe it is very much to the County of Santa Barbara’s financial benefit to see that there is an Isla Vista Community Services District.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Associate Student Government Senator and I.V. resident Ethan Bertrand said SBCC A.S. unanimously voted to support AB 3, and he is in favor of a parking district to better manage parking in the streets of I.V. and monitor I.V. visitors.</p>\n<p>“A parking district as included in AB 3 would allow more control for who can park in Isla Vista, which would help regulate out-of-towners and just bring more order to our streets,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Roger Aceves said a parking district can be established through Santa Barbara County and does not require AB 3.</p>\n<p>“This thing about the parking district — the county can do that,” Aceves said.</p>\n<p>SBCC trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he is not unwilling to form a CSD through LAFCO, but feels some members of the board would oppose the bill regardless of whether it went through the LAFCO process or not.</p>\n<p>“I just personally get the feeling that LAFCO is going to oppose AB 3 CSD whether we include LAFCO in the process or not,” Abboud said. “I’m getting the feeling from comments that your [LAFCO’s] board members have already said in public that this will not pass, regardless, so including you in the process almost seems like a moot point, because to include you would be to kill the bill at a later date.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said LAFCO and Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative should work together to focus on the main problem of addressing I.V.’s community needs instead of opposing each other’s ideas.</p>\n<p>“Just take a step back and look at [what] the problem we are really trying to solve is, which is the safety and welfare of residents in Isla Vista,” Abboud said. “We could just negotiate and work in good faith together without any preconceived notion of what should happen in Isla Vista and focus on what the residents think should happen … instead of coming up with your own idea of blocking the ideas of people who have been working on it for years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Louis Mariano said he does not see a purpose in including LAFCO, because the commission consistently opposes the bill.</p>\n<p>“Last Tuesday, we did discuss including LAFCO in the process, but if you oppose the bill, why would we want to bring you into the discussion furtherly?” Mariano said. “We do want to bring you in on the implementation of the CSD, but if you really oppose it, there’s really no point because you’re not going to want the CSD to succeed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said the bill should not face opposition because it is representative of the needs of many I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s illogical to oppose or question this movement, because it’s a grassroots movement, and there has been information gathered across the board with regards to Latino families, students and even individuals who own houses in Isla Vista,” Garcia said. “We’ve been working for this for many hours and many weeks and this is a collective effort.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD­) Board Member Jacob Lebell said I.V needs representatives that would work with Santa Barbara County, UCSB and law enforcement to solve larger issues on behalf of the community.</p>\n<p>“Other entities such as the county, UCSB and the police need to have representatives of our community that they can talk to, negotiate and partner with to really address the large number of problems that our community is facing,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>Lebell said while he believes LAFCO members can potentially contribute to the CSD plan, their uncompromising attitude discourages him from wanting to work with them.</p>\n<p>“I do understand your concerns about AB 3 circumventing the LAFCO process,” Lebell said. “I think you all have value to add to it, but I would just like to make you aware that a lot of my fellow residents are quite frankly afraid of you.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman said the lack of sales tax and a transient occupancy tax in AB 3 is concerning for business owners, and the Utility Users Tax is the only tax item left in the bill.</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Downtown Business Association has been meeting recently, and one of the things that has come up there is that Utility Users Tax is the only tax that is left in the bill,” Freeman said. “The sales tax and the transient occupancy tax has been removed, and that’s a concern amongst business owners because it affects businesses.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he supports I.V. self-governance but does not think AB 3 will be a sufficient foundation without intervention from LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“The boundaries for the university are confusing,” Freeman said. “This is one of the many reasons why I have continued to believe that LAFCO should be involved.”</p>\n<p>LAFCO Vice-chair Craig Geyer said amendments to AB 3 address issues from LAFCO’s Feb. 19 letter of concern, such as board makeup and district boundaries, but the ad hoc committee on the bill still wants to see an amendment stating the CSD formation will go through LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“I think, at the end of the day, the consensus from the ad hoc committee was basically we should maintain an opposed position unless the motion comes back through local LAFCO,” Geyer said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Roger Welt said he sees progress in the amendments to AB 3 thus far and hopes Williams’ office will “keep up the good work,” but is not ready to support the bill without further clarification on the role of UCSB and funding for proposed elections.</p>\n<p>“You are starting to fill in the blanks,” Welt said. “I think there’s a couple things that are still hanging out there that give me reason to wait on this a little bit further.”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Janet Wolf also said AB 3 was making progress in clarifying the questions posed in the letter.</p>\n<p>“In our letter of opposition, we did get the chance to specify what some of our issues were,” Welt said. “This bill is moving forward — a lot of those questions are being answered, such as the makeup of the board and the boundaries”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Steve Lavagnino said he feels Santa Barbara County provides adequate services to I.V making AB 3 unnecessary and insulting.</p>\n<p>“I guess we take it a little personally — at least I do — on the Board of Supervisors when people say they are not getting the services they need in an unincorporated area,” Lavagino said. “The county’s really stepping up and providing a level of service that you might not see in a lot of other areas.”</p>\n<p>Welt said the lack of information on the proposed CSD’s financial feasibility limits the commission’s support of AB 3.</p>\n<p>“I really believe in the power of that feasibility study,” Welt said. “Finance is really important here, and the feasibility study might flush that out.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said he agrees with Lavagino that supporters of AB 3 take county services for granted.</p>\n<p>“I agree with Commissioner Lavagino,” Aceves said. “I would take offense to that, because a lot of money spent is providing the necessary services, but now we’re asking to add additional taxes.”</p>\n<p>But Farr said I.V. needs more services than the county can provide, and a CSD with a UUT would create the needed funding.</p>\n<p>“In looking at all the things the CSD wants to do, I could go down every one of them and tell you how we have tried and continue to try to find the money to support so many of these,” Farr said. “Without a dedicated source of funding for Isla Vista, the county is not going to be able to keep up with what it needs”</p>\n<p>Lavagino said LAFCO should not support AB 3 until a financial feasibility study is complete.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think any of us in any of our jurisdictions will move forward on anything without finding out first if it makes financial sense,” Lavagino said. “The only way we can do that is with a feasibility study.”</p>\n<p>Lavagino said he fears student proponents of AB 3 are unrealistic in their support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I feel like these young people are well-intentioned and maybe have been sold something they feel is a panacea,” Lavagino said. “If this thing goes down the road … my fear is, down that road, you’re going to be looking five years after the CSD is there and saying ‘Wow I don’t see a whole heck of a lot that’s different.’”</p>\n<p>According to Aceves, only a city or county can impose a Utility Users Tax, meaning a CSD imposing a UUT in I.V. would require additional legislation.</p>\n<p>“How can this bill authorize a special district to it, because that is, in my mind, concerning, because every special district in the county would want to take advantage of that if they could.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said LAFCO is not impeding the CSD formation process as many AB 3 supporters suggested, but rather doing their job.</p>\n<p>“We are legislatively required to follow the law,” Aceves said. “It’s what we have to do as a Local Agency Formation Commission for the orderly development of special districts or cities, and this one doesn’t even want to talk to us.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said he was concerned AB 3 allows 10 years for I.V. residents to approve a UUT by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p>“What are these board members going to do for ten years with no money?” Aceves said.</p>\n<p>Moorhouse also said he was concerned about the bill’s establishment of a 10-year period for approval of the tax.</p>\n<p>“We could actually have an election every year,” Moorhouse said. “Tens upon tens of thousands of dollars could be spent.”</p>\n<p>Commissioner Bob Orach said he thinks the proposed CSD should better incorporate IVRPD.</p>\n<p>“It would seem to me that the CSD having that power and authority — those local officials that are concerned about their parks and recreation — why wouldn’t they be included?” Orach said.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Jeff Moorhouse said AB 3 should follow the LAFCO process in order to form a long-term solution for I.V., and it is important to include larger I.V. entities, such as UCSB, in the self-governance process.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to do this the right way and do the process the way it should be done, so when change is made, it’s sustainable and will last for generations,” Moorhouse said. “I don’t think that’s gonna happen until you get some of the major players participating. UCSB has been one of the entities that has helped create this disadvantaged community. We need to get UCSB to the table.”</p>\n<p>Moorhouse said AB 3 takes away local power by allowing the state legislature to mandate county-level elections.</p>\n<p>“In the language that is currently proposed, it states that the County of Santa Barbara is going to put it on the ballot,” Moorhouse said. “We are being told by the state legislature that we are going to expend thousands upon thousands of dollars for an election.”</p>\n<p>Geyer said Williams should amend AB 3 to include LAFCO in the CSD establishment process.</p>\n<p>“What I support is opposing this bill until it’s amended to include the formation of the proposed district through the local LAFCO,” Geyer said. “Most of the questions — district boundary, financial feasibility — that would all be vetted through our normal LAFCO process”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO should have used more positive language in its initial stance on the bill.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity to try to do something, finally, for Isla Vista,” Farr said. “If LAFCO initially had taken a position of ‘support if amended,’ as opposed to ‘opposed unless amended,’ even though they seem to be two sides of the same coin, I think the import is much different.”</p>\n<p>Fox also said LAFCO should take a more supportive stance of AB 3 while voicing concerns about potential issues.</p>\n<p>“We need to take ‘unless amended’ out of there for some more positive words that say ‘we’re here to help you as an organization of LAFCOs,” Fox said.</p>\n<p>Wolf also said LAFCO should help the I.V. self-governance movement and motioned that the commission support AB 3 if amended.</p>\n<p>“I think we should take an affirmative stance,” Wolf said. “I think we should support this bill and make recommendations for amendments and/or clarifications.”</p>\n<p>Aceves said LAFCO should not support the bill until members are satisfied with its language and made a substitute motion to oppose the bill unless amended to include LAFCO in the CSD formation.</p>\n<p>“The amendment will include specifics,” Aceves said. “One: that they go through LAFCO, and two: that they have a feasibility study.”</p>\n<p>Aceves’ motion passed in a five-to-two vote, with only Farr and Wolf voting against it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

murder</h3>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) held a memorial tree planting Wednesday to honor the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at the school’s West Campus.</p>\n<p>Students and administrators planted sunflowers and six trees to honor each of the six students who passed away last spring. SBCC President Lori Gaskin and two members of SBCC’s Associated Student Government spoke to dedicate the memorial grove. A plaque with the names of the six students sits in the middle of the grove.<br>\nGaskin said the memorial trees represent ongoing remembrance of the six students.</p>\n<p>“It is to honor and remember the victims through tree planting in order to have a permanent symbol of what happened last year,” Gaskin said. “It is for future generations to see so that it can live on in perpetuity and remembrance of those six victims.”</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, the event is an opportunity to unite Santa Barbara communities.<br>\n“Right now, it is time to work together with UCSB, Isla Vista and the Santa Barbara community, which is more of an opportunity for us to strengthen ties,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said college is a time of “joy, celebration and discovery,” and the victims should not have lost that time.</p>\n<p>“For those opportunities to be shattered is devastating, as it happened to the six young lives,” Gaskin said. “It causes reflection and calls to action for things to change.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government President and second-year undeclared major Colette Brown said the trees create a space to appreciate natural beauty and remember the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think it is necessary for us to use this space not only for something beautiful, but for those individuals who were killed last year in Isla Vista,” Brown said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63155\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63155\" data-attachment-id=\"63155\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/sbcc-remembers-may-23-2014/tree-memorial_lorenzo-basilio-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430925421\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"60\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tree Memorial_Lorenzo Basilio-10\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63155\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tree-Memorial_Lorenzo-Basilio-10.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63155\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>SBCC Associated Student Government Vice President of External Affairs and second-year business and administration major Caleb Ransom said the memorial grove will foster unity in support of those who were close to the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think this is crucial for the families and friends of those who have passed away,” Ransom said. “We all mourn and I think this is ultimately important for the community and the colleges because it brings everyone together.
