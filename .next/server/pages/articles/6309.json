Women out there who read any kind of fashion magazine — and the men they sleep with — may be the first ones aware of changing trends, but as time goes on, word spreads, and we all become aware of developing trends for your down-there hair.</p>\n<p>The waves of change are puzzling in many cases, and one has to wonder if your choice of vulvar topiary really matters (probably not). However, things like merkins pubic wigs worn by actors as an attempt at modesty, or vajazzling, the motivations for which are mystifying unto themselves, are examples of the bizarre options the freedoms we have as Americans bring us.</p>\n<p>On shaving and waxing: The options for landscaping vary immensely, but if you’re doing any kind of management for your lady or man fur, the go-to options are shaving and waxing. We all know the potential issues with shaving — and the longer you do it, the more likely you are to have nasty side effects. It does seem that the general population at UCSB leans toward waxing, if only because you have to book B Boutique appointments two weeks in advance. The idea of spreading your legs for a stranger without a guaranteed orgasm is uncomfortable enough, but the pain of having hair ripped out of your body is much worse. The good news is the more you go, the less you grow, basically, and your hair follicles actually get smaller over time, which means less bush and more bonsai tree.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>These trends can be hard to follow even if you’re trying, and to be honest, who has the time? When you finally do get your “situation” in order, you realize that everything really can be politicized, including your personal grooming habits. Once you start shaving or waxing, that interim growing-out period turns into a time where you’re nervous about what whoever you sleep with will say. You have hair now: will they be okay with it? Your intention may be to get rid of it, but having it in the meantime turns into a source of insecurity because you may not know what their preferences are. Not everyone is lucky enough to run into the guy who thinks “half a centimeter is ideal,” because, due to porn (ah, the good and the evil of it!), most guys forget that we, too, are capable of growing hair in many places — even if we don’t necessarily want it there.</p>\n<p>This is a time when some women are dyeing their armpit hair neon colors, and hair’s relevance to our culture is emerging as various issues such as cultural appropriation and feminism intertwine; this is no less true for your curlies. I’m sure we’ve all heard of or met the woman who says the preferences of men will not dictate what she does with her body, and the man who says he doesn’t like it when women resemble a prepubescent girl rather than a mature vixen.</p>\n<p>We tell ourselves that we make grooming decisions based on what we want for our own bodies. It’s true that most women get dressed for themselves, or for other women if anything, and we claim that we make our grooming decisions for the most part because of personal preference. Hair that’s visible to everybody is more subject to influence by social milieus, but if you really ask yourself, I’m sure it’s a mixture of personal preference and what you’re worried someone will say. When you hear that everyone is shaving, trimming or pulling it off with wax strips, the insecurity can abound. If other people are used to it, you don’t want to be talked about after your hookup as “that gross girl who didn’t shave.” Not to mention guys don’t go down enough as it is — you may be afraid to give your guy another excuse not to.</p>\n<p>At its root, this is a feminist topic — Not the feminism that people misunderstand as man-hating raucous ideology, but the real feminism that advocates for equality between sexes and genders. You should be able to make any grooming decision you want, whether you decide you want to braid, wax, dye or stick jewels on your area — it’s up to you. The societal issue lies in the fact that you may become insecure when you’re waiting for hair to grow out between waxes because of what whoever sees you naked will say. Real equality would be being able to tell your boyfriend that you want him to wax into a landing strip and having him actually consider it because he knows it makes you happy, but outside of a relationship — where things like that may be up for discussion — you shouldn’t have to worry about what somebody else thinks. So take a deep breath, figure out what you want and go for it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/","id":6309,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6308,6307,6306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent","biography":"Not available","articles":[6300,6302,6309,6339],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Disturbing Reality Behind the Scenes of Amateur Porn","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-12.32.34-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-12.32.34-PM.png?resize=621%2C394&ssl=1","description":"When one scrolls through Pornhub nowadays, the majority of thumbnails they see are not images of toned, tan, blonde actresses with fake double D’s and a perfectly applied layer of heavy makeup.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When one scrolls through Pornhub nowadays, the majority of thumbnails they see are not images of toned, tan, blonde actresses with fake double D’s and a perfectly applied layer of heavy makeup. In recent years, porn sites have increasingly featured clips of young, natural-looking women in unassuming bedrooms who look like they could easily be the hot girl you pass in the street on the way to work or sit next to in your next class. In our digital age, agents, production companies and networking are no longer necessary for an aspiring porn star to make it big. In order to star in your own erotic film, the process is now as simple as film, edit and upload. This emerging category of low-budget, low-production films starring inexperienced actresses is known to audiences as “amateur porn.” Its natural and spontaneous feel holds an alluring appeal to viewers, making them feel as if they are watching real people having real sex rather than a scripted, airbrushed encounter.</p>\n<p>I’m going to come right out and say that I used to be one of these people with whom amateur porn struck a particularly appealing chord. As a curious girl searching for material that would actually satisfy my needs, the exaggerated screams and forced expressions of delight in professional porn videos just did not pique my interest to the level I desired.

I’m here to inform you about the dark side of this rapidly expanding trend and the reasons why I now refuse to watch amateur porn.</p>\n<p>After taking a close look at amateur porn and its creation process, the regrettable conclusion I have reached is this: unlike professional porn — a large industry network composed of producers, agents and performers who all must abide by certain regulations or risk a bad reputation within the industry or even losing their job — the low budget, minimally produced nature of amateur porn opens the door for the manipulation and abuse of female performers who are fully unprepared for what they’re getting into.</p>\n<p>So how exactly does this manipulation occur? One of the answers lies in the digital era we live in today. Ten or 20 years ago, most pornography was made by professional companies who produced the films and released them on DVD. Therefore, the only people who made them were employed in the industry and were incentivized to go about filming and producing in a way that was fair to the actors in order to maintain their status and reputation as professionals. These types of established companies still exist today, but they now share the stage with small independent producers who make amateur films at a low budget and release them straight to the internet.</p>\n<p>Now, one does not need to be a professional or work for any sort of company in order to produce and distribute porn; to start filming, the only steps necessary are recruiting some performers, setting up a camera and pressing “record.” This gives independent producers enormous discretion on how they wish to go about hiring and treating their performers.</p>\n<p>Large, established companies have a reputation to uphold and many employees working to make sure that reputation, and their own reputations, are pristine. However, independent producers with no institutional ties must only ensure the quality of their content, not the fairness of its production. The process of filming a video and publishing it straight to the internet removes the sense of accountability that would be present in a professional shoot.</p>\n<p>I also think it’s necessary to look at the girls who are performing in these videos. One of the most alluring aspects of amateur porn is that the performers starring in it are, well, amateurs: young, inexperienced girls just past the age of 18 who have little to no prior experience with the industry and are simply trying to earn some cash. They don’t have connections to people who have been in the industry and know how it works, nor do they have the financial or professional status to provide leverage for their own needs. This creates an alarming power dynamic between the performers and the producers hiring them; a young, naive girl starting out in amateur porn does not have the resources, knowledge or professional experience to know when she is being treated unfairly or what to do about it.</p>\n<p>If she is being flown out to a location to film the scene, she may not feel comfortable objecting to scenes she does not desire to perform for fear of upsetting the people who have so graciously paid for her flight and will ultimately be signing her paycheck at the end of the day. Unfortunately, this is a perfect opportunity for producers to take advantage of the way girls have been conditioned to behave in our society: be kind, be likeable, appear sexy and confident, but do what you’re told and don’t be a bitch or a diva by complaining when you feel a situation has crossed the line.</p>\n<blockquote><p>the decision [to get into porn] makes a whole lot of sense once you understand the limited options these young women face.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In porn, “crossing the line” can translate to a girl being forced to perform in scenes which include acts such as forced oral sex, verbal and/or physical aggression, or anal sex. Since these more intense scenes mean bigger paychecks for all involved, producers have a monetary incentive to push performers to their limits with little regard for their willingness to perform these acts. Though many people are habituated to seeing these kind of scenes in mainstream porn, an amateur actress may have never performed these acts on her own, let alone on camera, and may reasonably be afraid or uncomfortable to proceed but feel that she has no choice. Without a formal contract or her own agent to consult, the performer doesn’t know if she can object and may feel that her only option is to perform the scene and get it over with.</p>\n<p>For anyone who justifies unfair treatment of these girls on the basis that they willingly signed up to be in porn, consider the potential for coercion due to their socioeconomic status and lack of other options available. For example, a girl growing up in a poor Midwestern town faces the choice of remaining in her local vicinity and becoming a wife and mother, going off to college and then pursuing her own career or finding some other means of income if she wishes to become independent and leave her hometown.</p>\n<p>If she chooses to settle down, she will be financially controlled by a man and unable to break free should the relationship become abusive. If she chooses college, the question of how to pay looms over her head. Therefore, it makes sense that she would jump at the opportunity to earn a few thousand or maybe even a few hundred dollars despite the possibility of harm. A person who is financially well situated with attainable goals and a supportive network of family and friends may shake their head in perplexity at girls who throw themselves into porn in the hopes of making it big, but the decision makes a whole lot of sense once you understand the limited options these young women face.</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the lack of legal regulations placed on pornographic content. The few laws that do exist mostly consist of ineffective attempts to prevent the spread of STDs, and do not address consent or fair treatment of the performers at all. For example, a 2012 law called Measure B requires the use of condoms in all anal and vaginal porn scenes in California, but this requirement can be easily bypassed by filming the scenes in other states. Another regulation requires performers to be tested for STDs every 14 days and present documentation of their clean status, but many STDs have incubation periods of several months, allowing the possibility of an undetected infection to be passed from one performer to another despite clean test results. These shaky mandates are a few of the only laws in place regulating the process of making pornography, and they are grossly ineffective in practice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whether or not they choose to take advantage of it, independent producers of amateur porn have the ability to profit from the abuse and coercion of female performers with few ramifications.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The legal system for preventing STDs in porn may be flawed, but in terms of consent and abuse of power, there is essentially no system at all. It seems that the law only has STDs in mind as harms that could potentially occur on the set of a porn shoot. Suing in civil court for assault or rape could technically be an option for girls who feel they have been forced to perform a scene, but considering the condescending attitude our society has toward sex workers, I highly doubt that a judge or jury would have any sympathy for a young girl who elected to partake in porn. No matter how legitimate her claims may be, the stigma against girls who openly engage in sexual activity is just too deeply ingrained.</p>\n<p>If high school and college-aged girls are shamed and not taken seriously in the wake of an assault, imagine the fate of a porn star attempting to make these allegations. Without an effective legal system in place to report harmful incidents, amateur performers have no means of seeking justice or accountability.</p>\n<p>The combination of factors including the digital process of creating and distributing amateur porn, the imbalance of power between female performers and independent producers and the lax laws regulating pornography sets up many opportunities for producers to violate or abuse their performers in the process of creating pornographic scenes. Before you rush to call me extreme or radical for raising these issues, keep in mind that I am not claiming that the harms I have listed occur on every single amateur porn shoot or that producers are inherently unethical. I simply wish to draw attention to the monetary incentive for abusing performers and the ease with which producers can get away with this behavior.</p>\n<p>Whether or not they choose to take advantage of it, independent producers of amateur porn have the ability to profit from the abuse and coercion of female performers with few ramifications. Some of these instances have gone public (type “GirlsDoPorn controversy” into your search browser and you will find several allegations regarding the popular amateur porn network GirlsDoPorn.com and its abuse of female performers), but these incidents are certainly not the only ones that have occurred. It is simply too easy for producers to take advantage of the young girls who depend on them for a source of income.</p>\n<p>Many people watch these scenes every day, blissfully unaware as I once was of the abuse and unethical treatment that can occur behind the scenes. I’m not advocating for anyone to stop watching porn altogether — that would be an extreme and, let’s face it, entirely unrealistic proposition to an audience of sexually frustrated college students.</p>\n<p>All I’m asking is that the next time your mouse hovers over a promising thumbnail of a young, innocent looking girl posed demurely on a bed gazing seductively at the camera, consider the ordeal that this girl may have had to endure in order to create this scene for your viewing pleasure. Think about the potential abuse and coercion that you are implicitly endorsing when you press play. In this situation, awareness is key. If viewers start demanding fair treatment and accountability, then maybe one day amateur porn stars will truly be as authentically and naturally in their element as they appear to be today.</p>\n<p><em>Laurel Rinehart wants you to think about what might be happening in amateur porn that you don’t see on camera. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.

Some of these connections are so real and so powerful and they last just a second before they slip away.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Then there are those people that you meet accidentally on the street, at a party, at a meeting.

How they could ignite a fire and then just walk away with only small burns around the edges.</p>\n<p>But I have come to realize that maybe it is better this way. For in moments of such connection, there is no slow trickling of knowledge and information being transferred between people, rather it is all of you hitting all of them all at once. Two entities colliding. It’s powerful, it’s deadly and, thus, it is short lived.</p>\n<p>How can you take all that passion and force and try to forge a second encounter? You can’t. And maybe you shouldn’t want to. Maybe you shouldn’t wonder how something so real could just cease to be. Because the disappearing act that these romances play on us is what keeps the magic alive.</p>\n<p>There is nothing to ruin it. Just momentary magic, wonder, connection, mystery, allure — all taken away by the night. That’s the selfish thing about nighttime. It gives as much as it takes. How else can it maintain its mystery and allow you to keep setting fires within others?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Two entities colliding. It’s powerful, it’s deadly and, thus, it is short lived</p></blockquote>\n<p>And with every night comes the possibility of being able to see how your fire burns differently within each temporary soulmate. They provide you with just enough hope and reminder that there are still things that are real and true and intense. That you aren’t always operating on a frequency that is unreachable, you just have to find the right spark.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t always matter the origin of the spark, just that there is something that can reach within you and make you feel.</p>\n<p>So do not mourn your almost-lover. Let him go gentle into that good night. You were made better by his entrance, but you will not be made worse by his exit.</p>\n<p><em>Anjalie Tandon hopes we welcome each fleeting interaction</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/","id":6307,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[6306,6305,6304],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Casual Dating Becomes Not So Casual","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/casual-dating-art-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/casual-dating-art-1-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos shares her thoughts on the ups and down of casual relationships.

We without a doubt have more liberated, realistic, and open views on sexuality and love than the generations preceding us. This, like pretty much anything else, has its positives and negatives. For one, it helps to keep us more motivated to be independent and secure on our own. Two, it’s opened the floodgates for important conversation about sex and other topics that need to be discussed. And three, it allows for us to truly explore ourselves on a deeper level, before deciding to make a real commitment. Playing the field and discovering what you really desire out of life is great, but it’s not always as easy as it sounds.</p>\n<p>No matter how hard we try to “keep it casual” we’re still human beings with human emotions. Spending intimate time with someone WILL lead to some sort of intimate feeling. Disclosing information about yourself to others, and having others do the same to you, is an experience that WILL emotionally bond you. And no matter how hard we try to fight it, sex WILL make things more complicated.</p>\n<p>While our generation may be less naïve about certain aspects of relationships, we’re arrogantly ignorant when it comes to accepting the reality of our emotions. We constantly play with fire, blindly thinking that if the flame catches, we won’t be the one who gets burned. I mean, is there anything wrong with fuck buddies, FWB’s, or one-night-stands? In my opinion, no, not as long as you can handle what comes with the territory. Unfortunately, many of us can’t, but try to pretend like we can.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>In fact, anyone who actually thinks that they are above the simple human emotion of attachment is in for a rude awakening.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, doing the casual thing is not by any means impossible. Lots of people can do it, and they can love it, and they can be really good at it. But, everyone has his or her limitations. Everyone has the capacity to feel and to fall. In my opinion, accepting this reality is actually the first step to successfully being able to date casually. It’s important to know that you’re not invincible when going into any sort of sexual or romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>For some reason, our generation seems to have a tough time swallowing this pill.

While we tend to think that these assist in some sort of self-preservation, they are frankly just unrealistic, selfish, and immature. I don’t know who we think we’re fooling.

If you don’t believe me, keep reading, because I was just like you not too long ago.</p>\n<p>My journey of sex and relationships took off with a rocky start.

I went from thinking I was supposed to have sex with one person my whole life, to quickly trying to discount sex as being nothing more than a physical act.</p>\n<p>After acquiring a bit more life and sexual experience, I thought that I had a pretty solid perspective on the whole thing. I thought that sex could mean more than just sex, but only if I was going to let it. I thought, that I could have complete control over my feelings, and whom they were for. So, this summer, I had a goal. My goal was to have as much fun as possible, with no strings attached during my last summer as a college student.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I became overwhelmed and spread too thin. Things changed, feelings were hurt, and like always, I learned something new.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A guy that I had hoped for a second chance with was going to be gone until September, so it was the perfect opportunity for me to be carefree and uninhibited. Then, after a summer full of frivolous fun, maybe I would have my chance at something more real.</p>\n<p>About two weeks into July, I met a new someone. Someone who was supposed to be moving far away in a couple of months. Someone who wasn’t in any position to be starting any sort of relationship. It was perfect. We got to know each other, had a lot of fun, and before I even realized what was happening, this person became my best friend. I had never been treated with such respect, care, or intensity. Things began to move fast and suddenly I was completely invested. As the weeks continued, feelings evolved, plans changed, things became more serious, and then it was September.</p>\n<p>I ended up getting what I had hoped for. A second chance with someone that I wasn’t sure would give me one. The only problem was that my “casual summer fling” wasn’t so casual anymore. At first I thought I could handle it. I thought I could juggle all of the emotions and confusion that I was experiencing. I thought that I could do the casual thing, with two people who I already had invested feelings in, until I absolutely needed to make a decision.</p>\n<p>As I enjoyed the attention and confidence of having two guys wanting to be around, I felt invincible. I thought that for sure, I wasn’t going to be in any position to get hurt. I actually thought that I was in a great position to be in. I had options. Two guys who I really liked, two guys who I enjoyed spending time with.</p>\n<p>The disappointing reality of my attempt at casual dating hit me after a couple of weeks of trying to juggle my various emotions. It couldn’t be done. I became overwhelmed and spread too thin. Things changed, feelings were hurt, and like always, I learned something new. I learned that casual dating is possible, but only if you actually keep things casual.</p>\n<p>I learned that no matter how much you tell yourself that you won’t fall, sometimes you do. I learned that toying with serious feelings and promises leads to hurt. And I learned that no matter how hard you try to control things, they just don’t always fall into place the way you think they will.</p>\n<p>While this experience was not what I thought it would be, it gave me the tools that I needed to figure how I can do casual dating the right way for me. Everyone is different; everyone has different expectations and different needs. As for me, I now know what my limitations are. I now know that I can in fact do the casual thing, but only with one person at a time. I now know that when casually dating, I can allow myself to fall a little bit, knowing that I very well might get hurt in the end. And I now know how I want to be treated and how I want to treat others, even when dating casually.</p>\n<p>So, if you think casual dating might be right for you, try it. Just remember: you’re not an emotionless robot that is impervious to feelings (no matter how hard you try), always be honest with yourself about what it is that you truly want, regardless of how you feel it will make you look to others, and most importantly, remember that casual dating is above all else, supposed to be fun. So go out there, and enjoy it.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos encourages you to have fun without forgetting that feelings are real. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-12/when-casual-dating-becomes-not-so-casual/","id":6308,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6307,6306,6305],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
