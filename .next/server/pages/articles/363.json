UC Davis regained its second place standing in the conference as a result of UCSB’s loss and with a 75-57 victory over Cal Poly. The Aggies will host Santa Barbara with records of 11-7 and 4-1 in Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Prior to the start of conference play, the Gauchos’ identity as a team was a questionable matter heading into the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>However, through six Big West games, UCSB’s identity continues to gradually build around its improvements on offense. Santa Barbara has nearly improved in every statistical category since the beginning of conference play. UCSB currently ranks third in the conference in field goal percentage at 45.8, fourth in points per game with an average of 68.0 and fifth in three-point percentage at 35.5.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara has improved offensively, its prowess on defense has turned into a source of scoring as the Gauchos’ average of 9.2 steals per game ranks second in the Big West. As UCSB has forced opponents to turn the ball over, it has influenced the flow of ball movement in UCSB’s offense and will be a vital asset in the Gauchos containing the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes you just think execution is on the offensive end, but it’s on the defensive end as well,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Their [UC Davis] guards will try to post us because we’re a lot smaller. For us to try to pressure the post on a pass will be important for us.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, UCSB averages 16.0 assists per game, ranking third in the Big West. Leading UCSB’s passing attack has been junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She ranks second in assists per game, nearly doubling her average since the start of conference play improving from 3.9 to 6.7 per contest. She posted a career-high 10 assists in the first meeting versus the Aggies as she dished dimes to teammates like sophomore guard Makala Roper who scored a game-high 26 points in the victory.</p>\n<p>“As a point guard, you’re always kind of held at a different level and Coach Bonnie has made that clear,” Jemerigbe said. “She’s been pushing me and every time she pushes me I get better. My teammates help me of course, without them knocking down the shots, I don’t get the assists.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s defense has been a disruption in the passing lanes for opponents, the Gauchos’ quick hands will not always make up for their size disadvantage. It is a drawback that has affected their performance when rebounding the ball, landing UCSB with a conference low average of 30.3 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Although Davis grabbed just seven more rebounds than UCSB in the first meeting, outrebounding the Gauchos 40-33, the Aggies’ ability to rebound the ball is essential to capitalizing on their size.</p>\n<p>Davis’ length provides a versatile element which goes beyond it being a threat in the paint. It is also the reason the Aggies have been such a lethal team when shooting the ball from beyond the arc in being able to rebound the ball and make the passes to set up perimeter shots.</p>\n<p>Their 39.5 three-point field goal percentage leads the Big West as senior forward Celia Marfone and sophomore forward Pele Gianotti are the Aggies’ top sharpshooters from long range. Both rank in the top five of the conference in three-point field goal percentage with Marfone owning a Big West leading 49 percent and Gianotti in second at 40.7 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Gianotti registered her first career double-double in Davis’ loss to UCSB, tallying 19 points and 10 rebounds. Her dual-threat ability to shoot from behind the perimeter and score in the post in the ideal complement to redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch.</p>\n<p>Bertsch is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 13.1 ppg in addition to her conference leading 58.1 field goal percentage which ranks 12<sup>th</sup> in the nation. As a team, Davis holds national rankings in field goal percentage (43.9 percent) and field goal percentage defense (36.3 percent), ranking 41<sup>st</sup> and 45<sup>th</sup> in the country along with ranking second in the conference in both statistical categories, respectively.</p>\n<p>UCD held UCSB to just seven points in the first quarter of last week’s contest. Yet, both teams registered first half field goal percentages below 30 percent in the initial meeting.</p>\n<p>“We always say don’t have amnesia,” Henrickson said. “The rules on offense are: drive it, shoot it, but don’t hold it. When things work, keep doing it and when things don’t work, quit doing it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tipoff at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 30 in the Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67617\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67617\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/","id":363,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[362,361,360],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Sluggish First Half Drowns Gauchos At Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-24-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-24-web.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With their third loss out of four to open up Big West play, the Gauchos are in a bit of a hole to start the conference season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67479\" style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67479\" data-attachment-id=\"67479\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/eric-childress-peeks-towards-the-hoop-cameryn-brockdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-24-web.jpg?fit=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"401,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Childress peeks towards the hoop.

The 49ers cemented their current third-place position in the conference at 9-11 overall, 3-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was a rough game for us. Quite frankly we just didn’t come ready to play,” senior guard Michael Bryson said. “It’s kind of frustrating. I don’t know how many times we have to take a loss for us to respond.”</p>\n<p>In recent outings, UCSB has been at its worst late in the second half, especially in last Saturday’s 61-52 loss to UC Irvine when the it went scoreless for the final 10:50 at home. Last night’s game told a different story, as the 49ers got off to a quick 10-2 start out of the gate, including seven points from freshman forward Mason Riggins.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer from senior guard Michael Bryson with 10:07 left cut the lead to 12-9, but Long Beach responded with a 19-7 run and never looked back. The 49er lead was 36-23 the halftime break and never reached higher than 15 for the game, but every time momentum looked to be swinging toward UCSB, the Beach had an answer.</p>\n<p>“In the first half we came out a little slow, sluggish, lethargic, just not really energized and ready to play,” senior forward John Green said. “In the second half we were starting to click a little bit but it’s tough to get out of a hole when a team is making shots.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach guard Justin Bibbins was there to kill the Gauchos’ runs all night, going 5-5 on three-pointers for a game-high 25 points.</p>\n<p>“They hit open threes that we were giving them, they were attacking, really going at us, putting their shoulder down,” Bryson said. “They were the aggressor tonight and it shows. Once they took the lead they never gave it back.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson looked calm and collected on offense all night, scoring a UCSB-high 23 points. The conference’s leading scorer finished with an efficient 10-16 shooting night, including 3-6 on threes, before fouling out late in the game.</p>\n<p>After trailing for nearly the entire game, a late comeback gave the Gauchos hope that they could salvage a win despite a lethargic first half performance. Five straight points from senior forward John Green cut the lead to 69-61 with 4:55 remaining. Just 92 seconds later, a left-handed lay-in by Bryson cut it to 71-65, bringing UCSB the closest it had been since the 8:12 mark of the first half.</p>\n<p>From there, it was the 5’8” Bibbins who finished off Santa Barbara once and for all, scooping in a dagger layup with 2:11 remaining to give the 49ers a 10-point lead on their way to the 77-67 win.</p>\n<p>“The second half I recognized that group, but you can’t play 20 or 30 minutes, you’ve got to play 40 minutes,” Williams said. “Long Beach played well offensively and Bibbins was sensational, but when you can’t get stops, it’s really difficult to crawl back in a game.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach shot 50 percent for the night, taking advantage of poor UCSB defense by scoring relatively easy open shots off down screens and dribble penetration. The Gauchos shot 42.1 percent as a team for the game, but were a much different team in the second half, scoring 44 points compared to just 23 in the first.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to take some positives away from the loss. Its 17 free throw attempts were the most it has had in its last seven outings.</p>\n<p>“I did like how we competed the second half of the game,” Williams said. “We kept the pedal on, we kept attacking, we didn’t get our heads down, we kept aggressive the second half of the game.”</p>\n<p>The night also saw the return of Green, who missed the Gauchos’ last six games with a knee injury. Clearly not at 100 percent as he played with a brace, Green provided the Gauchos some much needed energy and offensive punch, recording 12 points and seven rebounds off the bench.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ improved second-half energy also saw them finish with a 38-28 rebounding advantage. Freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak led all players with eight boards.</p>\n<p>This Saturday, UCSB will play the last of its current three-game homestand against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67527\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67527\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/","id":360,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[359,358,357],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Eyeing Upset vs. UC Davis Tonight, Face UCR Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-7-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-7-of-13-web.jpg?resize=402%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team hopes to continue its current two-game winning streak as it looks to end UC Davis' undefeated conference record (3-0).

Turnovers have afflicted the Gauchos in a majority of their games this season, however they showed signs of improvement with season-lows of 10 and 12 against Fullerton and Northridge, respectively.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara has reduced its amount of turnovers in its last two contests, its defense has pestered opponents as of late. UCSB forced 35 turnovers in its last two wins, helping it garner 36 points off turnovers. Accompanying UCSB’s stout defense has been the effort of its players off the bench as well.</p>\n<p>Despite being supplanted of her starting role after the team’s 71-69 loss at Pepperdine, Jasmine Ware has been a consistent scorer from the Gauchos’ group of reserves. The senior guard has notched double-figures in scoring for seven consecutive games and ranks second on the team with 9.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>The recent emergence of junior center Je zhe Newton has been an encouraging sign for the Gauchos’ scoring in the paint. She scored a season-high 15 points in the team’s first road victory at Fullerton and has tallied double-figures in three-straight games while her average of 5.2 rebounds per game leads the Gauchos as well.</p>\n<p>Yet, it will be UCSB’s defense which will encounter the most difficult task in having to contain Davis’ array of scoring options. Four players in the Aggies’ starting lineup average 10-plus ppg. Moreover, it has been an impressive first-year for forward Morgan Bertsch after redshirting last season. Her 13.9 ppg leads UC Davis as she earned her fifth 20-point game of the season in Davis’ conference opener win over UCI and possesses a conference-leading 59.6 conference field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Following Santa Barbara’s quick return home is its matchup against UC Riverside on Saturday. The Gauchos will look to avenge their lone conference defeat thus far after a 30-point, 83-53 loss to the Highlanders in the opening week of the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>UCR’s 4-0 conference start puts it within just one win away from its best Big West start since joining the conference.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have continued their dominance so far this season, ranking eighth in the nation in assists-to-turnover ratio with a 1.35 average. They also lead the Big West in ppg (82.4), assists per game (22.3), and average the least amount of turnovers per game (10.8).</p>\n<p>After setting a season-high 33-points in the first meeting, star-studded guard Brittany Crain will certainly be on UCSB’s defensive radar. A senior from Moreno Valley, CA, Crain’s average of 19.2 ppg leads the conference and ranks 33<sup>rd</sup> in the nation. She is just 48 points shy of becoming the seventh player in Big West history to reach a career total of 2,000 points.</p>\n<p>Complementing the play of Crain is redshirt junior forward Rejane Verin. Since sitting out last season due to redshirting, the UNLV transfer has had a breakout year. She ranks second on the team and in the Big West in scoring with 17.8 ppg. Her career-high 34-point performance in the Highlanders’ 78-60 victory over LBSU earned her third Big West Conference Player of the Week award. While her ability to penetrate and control the paint down is valuable to UCR’s offense, Verin’s precise and efficient passing skills may be more pivotal. She is second on the team in assists per game at 4.1 and recorded a game-high eight assists in the Highlanders win over UCSB two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Riverside is a quickly paced offense that likes to run the floor, but the Gauchos must hold their ground and stay committed to their strategy in hopes of avenging their loss on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip-off tonight at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome as its game at UCR on Saturday, Jan. 23 will begin at 7 p.m. as well in the SRC Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67554\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67554\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-eyeing-upset-vs-uc-davis-tonight-face-ucr-saturday/","id":361,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[360,359,358],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB with 66-59 Upset Victory over UC Davis Thursday Night, Rematch at UCR on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-12-of-13-e1453428581461.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-12-of-13-e1453428581461.jpg?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sophomore guard Makala Roper fell one point shy of her career-high in points, scoring 26 points in the UCSB women's basketball team's upset of UC Davis on Thursday.

Davis moved down to third-place in the standings after encountering its first conference loss which snapped its four-game winning streak making the Aggies 10-7 overall, 3-1 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>It was a low scoring start for both teams as the first basket did not occur until two minutes into play. The Gauchos shot 2-17 from the field in the first quarter as a three-pointer and layup by Roper were the team’s only field goals, prompting her total of 10 points in the first half. Davis shot 4-14 to open the game, but an 8-2 run helped it to take a 10-7 lead at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara managed to respond with an 8-2 run of its own in the early stages of the second quarter, going up 15-12. Still, in spite of scoring stretches from both offenses, neither could establish a consistent source of scoring finishing the first half with field goal percentages below 30 percent.</p>\n<p>Yet, after a 0-7 shooting effort in the first quarter, senior guard Jasmine Ware managed to gain her shooting rhythm with back-to-back jumpshots to set UCSB up with its 22-20 lead at halftime. She led the Gauchos’ bench in scoring with 15 points in addition to grabbing five rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Jas is playing the four now because we’re depleted a little bit,” Henrickson said. “She hits timely shots. I thought she was antsy to begin with, but had the big three at the end of the third quarter. She guards, rebounds, has phenomenal effort and a big heart. We feed off of her.”</p>\n<p>After a three-point make by Roper, Ware drained a shot from long distance on the Gauchos next possession to regain the team’s double-figure lead of 47-36 heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>It was a noticeable effort by the Aggies in the second half to attempt to capitalize on their size advantage in the paint after shooting 28 percent from the field and 22.2 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Davis found success in its plan to go down low, achieving a 53.3 field goal percentage in the second half. Leading the Aggies was sophomore forward Pele Gianotti with a double-double of 17 points and 10 rebounds. However, she would be the only Davis player to finish with double-figures in scoring as the Aggies were unable to overcome their deficit.</p>\n<p>Entering Thursday’s contest, UCSB was shooting just 29.2 percent from beyond the arc. Although the team couldn’t convert the three-point shot in the first half, Henrickson never doubted the Gauchos’ shot selection from deep as they went 7-12 from behind the three-point line in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We said that going into the year we would have to manufacture offense from the three-point line because we aren’t very big inside,” she explained. “A pretty good chunk of those [three-point shots] are pretty good shots in rhythm. We just talked about shot mechanics– footwork, be a ready shooter, you shouldn’t be surprised by somebody trying to drive and kick. They’re 3-15, [we] tell them shoot it, just shoot it with good footwork and shot mechanics because we can knock those down.”</p>\n<p>Five of the Gauchos’ seven three-point field goals in the second half occurred in the third quarter, a period in which UCSB outscored UC Davis 25-16.</p>\n<p>As freshman guard Coco Miller picked up two quick fouls in the first half, senior guard Dioseline Lopez provided an energetic spurt of offense in her 14 minutes off the bench. She finished the game with five points, went 2-2 from the field while her lone three-point make was the stimuli to the team’s momentous run in the third quarter. Also aiding the Gauchos’ run was junior forward Mi’Chael Wright. In 12 minutes of play, Wright concluded the night with five points, three rebounds and drew a crucial offensive charge on the defensive end of the court to sustain UCSB’s great play.</p>\n<p>“Those are big minutes of production from two kids who haven’t played a lot lately,” Henrickson said. “Give them credit for being mature enough and hanging in there. If you’re dialed in on the bench, you’ll get rewarded for that. Any kids that pout on the bench, watch what happens when they get in. They’re not ready to play, give those two kids credit for being ready to play.”</p>\n<p>After just 10 turnovers at CSUF and 12 against CSUN, the Gauchos continued their consistency when handling the ball with just 13 turnovers, one less than UCD’s 14 on Thursday. It is the third consecutive game in which UCSB has registered less turnovers than its opponent.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 23 to face the Highlanders at 7 p.m. in the SRC Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67572\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67572\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/ucsb-with-66-59-upset-victory-over-uc-davis-thursday-night-rematch-at-ucr-on-saturday/","id":362,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[361,360,359],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
