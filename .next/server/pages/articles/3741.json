The board motioned to authorize the general manager to request funding from the university to cover the program.</p>\n<p>The finalization of the MOU encountered a minor hurdle during the meeting due to concerns about the contract phrasing which stipulated the investigator “be the primary point of contact for all such investigations occurring within the boundaries of the District.”</p>\n<p>A representative from the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) who was present during the meeting reported that the language in the MOU would create an interference with services and jurisdiction of the SBSO.</p>\n<p>“We just need to work through this to make sure we are not subverting the primary jurisdiction of the Sheriff and that we are not supplanting the services that are already provided by the Sheriff as it relates to these investigations,” he said.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Brianna Conway countered their concerns, saying the inclusion of the term “primary point of contact” provided an essential element to the position of the investigator.</p>\n<p>“What that does is tell survivors that the first person they tell [their] story to is gonna be the person that stays with [their] case throughout the duration… and really provide that continuity in care in that response,” Conway said during the public comment period.</p>\n<p>Several I.V. CSD directors agreed with Conway’s suggestions, adding that these were consistent with the intended model of the program.</p>\n<p>However, UCPD would be in charge of implementation of such policy practices during the operalization of the investigator position, according to I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>Several organizations have pushed for the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator in I.V., including Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), C.A.R.E, UCPD and the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Members of SASA who were present at Tuesday’s meeting were glad to see the fulfillment of a program that was under discussion for over a year.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a long conversation… We’re very happy to see that the needs to the community and the need for the localization of the resource being finally represented in the MOU,” SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also expressed similar sentiments of both hope and happiness at the long-awaited implementation of an interpersonal violence survivor service in Isla Vista</p>\n<p>“This will be successful. This is really about serving our community, making it a safer place and us, Isla Vista’s local government, saying that we believe survivors, that we stand with survivors and that time’s up,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Right before making the official motion to finalize the contract, Bertrand recounted the I.V. CSD’s first meeting, in which an attendee shared her experience of being a survivor of sexual assault in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The most important comment that I heard that night was… about the experiences of so many survivors in this community and it’s those experiences that really make me happy that we’re taking this action here,” Bertrand said, tearing up during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“There’s too many people getting hurt in this community. There’s no perfect way to solve it but this is a really good step and I’m just grateful that we’re taking it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud – campaigned on the promise of a low-income exemption for those who cannot afford the tax.</p>\n<p>Four months later, that promise remains in stasis.</p>\n<p>Brandt told the Nexus in June that the CSD was currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said in June.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD, which meets twice a month, has discussed the low-income exemption extensively at two of its meetings since UUT’s passing.</p>\n<p>However, the six-member board has not made any progress regarding the exemption and instead has discussed not implementing a low-income exemption for the tax.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members, such as Vice President Natalie Jordan, said it is hard to determine which households in I.V. are low-income because several households only have one name on certain utilities.</p>\n<p>She pointed to her own living situation in I.V. as an example.</p>\n<p>“[My household] receive[s] a discounted rate on electricity already because we have that one [low-income] person written onto the bill,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Other members, such as director Father Jon Hedges, argued all residents should pay the tax because of the voice the I.V. CSD gives the community.</p>\n<p>“The whole premise of the CSD was participatory democracy, a voice for our community, that we not be voiceless the way we’ve been for decades,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that the cost of a small bill per month is a small price to pay.”</p>\n<p>The issue on the table during the Oct. 9 meeting was whether or not to exempt I.V.’s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQhq8YjtkADsaqdHp8X7JumSONytqJPNLKQdu_csyms/edit#gid=0\">non-profit</a> housing providers, such as Friendship Manor and the SB Housing Co-op. The latter is composed of five houses: Newman, Merton, Bike, Manely and De Shain.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow argued if one group is allowed to be exempt, such as the non-profits, then it would create problems for everyone.</p>\n<p>“Once we say, ‘Your folks don’t have to pay the four dollars a month,’ you’re gonna open the floodgates, because every student in this town is for [the exemption],” he said.</p>\n<p>The issue was tabled until February 2019, when the district will have a better sense of its finances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is working toward “some sort of exemption or reduction,” though not necessarily a low-income exemption, Bertrand said to the Nexus following the meeting.</p>\n<p>“I wish we would address it now, but we can address it then, too,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“I struggle with this one because while [there is a] small amount of money that would be saved, it’s still something that we really — for the past few years now — mentioned some sort of utility reduction or exemption for low-income folks.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The final quote is attributed Bertrand, not Brandt. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The bacteria can manifest itself through diarrhea, high fevers and vomiting.</p>\n<p>The department confirmed during Thanksgiving break that the contaminated lettuce appeared to have come from the Central Coast growing regions from Central and Northern California, specifically from lettuce grown during this past summer.</p>\n<p>“The FDA believes it was critically important to have a ‘clean break’ in the romaine supply available to consumers in the U.S. in order to purge the market of potentially contaminated romaine lettuce related to the current outbreak,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>For the near future, romaine lettuce will be labeled with its harvest date and location, according to the FDA.</p>\n<p>The FDA is still investigating the outbreak.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
