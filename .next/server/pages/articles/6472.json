Now, with COVID-19, housing insecurity is an even scarier reality. The shelter-in-place and safer-at-home orders will not keep us safe if we cannot stay housed. And to put it simply, the UC is as unreliable an employer as they are a landlord.

Layoffs or reductions in pay would force impossible choices between maintaining adequate housing or maintaining adequate nutrition for our members and their families.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time of crisis, mutual aid is a form of organizing. One of our members helped create and distribute care packs to neighbors with masks, gloves, tenants rights pamphlets and Zoom call details for weekly tenants associations meetings. Several of our statewide unions have formed housing committees and are taking action by calling legislators to demand rent and mortgage cancellation throughout the crisis. We are meeting regularly and sharing resources on eviction moratoriums and renters’ rights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California’s public universities are essential to the health of our communities and to the economic recovery of our state. As part of the statewide housing rights movement, we recognize that the University of California, as the largest public employer in the state, has enormous power to limit the harm of future layoffs and help ensure we remain housed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mass layoffs in the middle of the most severe pandemic and economic recession of the last century would surely leave UC workers and their families unable to pay rent in some of the most unaffordable housing markets in the country. We have a responsibility to each other, especially now, and the president of the UC and UC Regents have a responsibility to the thousands of workers who ensure the university continues to run.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following organizations have worked to draft this letter to the editor: AFSCME 3299, Committee of Interns and Residents, California Nurses

Mar and Keith Oatley </span><a href=\"http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2010_01.dir/pdfc8vBXO7Maa.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">write in their study on “the function of fiction,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> narrative fiction “[offers] models or simulations of the social world via abstraction, simplification, and compression…[creating] a deep immersive simulative experience of social interactions for [the audience].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is slightly depressing to consider, absorbing Netflix’s character-driven teen dramedies like “Never Have I Ever” and “The Half of It” may help us to subconsciously practice social interaction in a time when our in-person conversations are entirely limited to mealtime chats with family members or housemates. In its own way, Netflix’s original content is preparing us for a post-isolation world, when we will have to relearn how to interact with people other than the members of our household in order to </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/4/16/21213635/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-legacy-quarantine-state-of-mind-frugality\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">break out of the “quarantine state of mind.”</span></a></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn down the lights, brew some tea and grab your favorite snack, because if there’s one curve we don’t need to worry about flattening in these trying times, it’s Netflix usage.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking this “immersive simulative experience” to the extreme, Dan Olson of the YouTube channel Folding Ideas revealed in </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsSzrVhdVuw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his March 31 video “I Can’t Stop Watching Contagion”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has watched the 2011 Steven Soderbergh film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contagion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “over fifteen times in the last few weeks.” He is not alone in this grim fascination, for he reports that “according to Netflix, at the time of writing, it is the second most-watched thing in Canada.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may seem like a self-destructive plot to amplify anxiety, but as Olson puts it, “watching a disaster film in a disaster [exposes us] to what we’re already experiencing. Amplifying existing emotional states, it works as a form of emotional inoculation. I am scared and anxious and uncertain, and so I will make myself more scared and more anxious and more uncertain, because it’s still fiction. It’s still safe. It still has an end. It is bounded.”  There is a certain comfort in witnessing the resolution of a large-scale pandemic, the real-world equivalent of which still has no end in sight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps to explain the </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rob_sheridan/status/1249803779794296832?s=20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sudden attention in the Twitter meme-iverse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the oblivious beachgoers and irresponsible mayor of 1975’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaws.” While the parallels to our current reality are amusing at best and disturbingly uncanny at worst, we have something to learn from movies like “Jaws”: how to deal with a disaster or, perhaps more informatively, how local institutions, federal governments and even individual citizens can mishandle their response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond fiction’s practically and emotionally instructive qualities, it also provides the core psychological necessity for a society seemingly in freefall: escapism.

In my two years as a news editor, I have been responsible for most, if not all, story pitches regarding students of color, and it has always been a fight to explain why the stories I pitched were necessary, and why the perspective I brought as a person of color to the paper was necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past two years, the few editors of color on staff took it upon ourselves to lead frank discussions within the newsroom, the news team and with leadership about the lack of diversity on staff and what we need to be doing better with our coverage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By no means am I saying that the work I or other editors did was enough — the Nexus has historically failed students of color on this campus, and to say that a few individuals cycling through the office could fix that would be disingenuous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The journalism industry at large struggles with these same issues, and without institutional change at the Nexus, and with the high turnover of a college newsroom, nothing will change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an organization that demands accountability and transparency from every entity on campus, the Nexus needs to uphold these same standards. After speaking with other journalists of color and from my familiarity with work in other newsrooms, these are a few recommendations that I’m leaving behind. They are by no means the fullest extent of what the Nexus should be doing, but a few places to start. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publish yearly or quarterly data on the diversity of the editorial staff.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a formal Diversity and Inclusion Board made up of members of the editorial staff as well as outside representatives. (The Daily Texan has a good reference for a Diversity and Inclusion board </span><a href=\"https://thedailytexan.com/2019/02/03/introducing-the-texans-raising-voices-initiatives-same-paper-new-commitment-to-diversity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The goal of this board should be to serve as an internal resource for staffers and to oversee diversity initiatives. These should be paid positions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Nexus version of this </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uk0LrP2iM22rY39quqJZBZOstFNAGirJd5KH9hjRAKo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guidelines for Inclusive Journalism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> document from the Seattle Times Diversity &amp; Inclusion Task Force and hold a mandatory staff-wide meeting to distribute it to all current and future editorial staff members and go over the content.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicate time and resources to doing intentional outreach to students of color and the many student-led organizations on campus that create spaces for students of color.

The Nexus, and its white leadership in particular, needs to be more conscientious about how to support these staffers and editors once they join the newsroom, and to listen to what they’re saying, even if it makes them uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus’ white leadership also needs to spend time educating themselves about race, and fostering conversations within the newsroom at large about how students of color are being covered. The newsroom cannot make progress if the Nexus tokenizes the editors of color that are on staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, I really naively thought that the Nexus was immune to the problems that plagued this industry. I know better now, and I ask that the Nexus takes these steps and more to do better for the students of color on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an outgoing editor at the Daily Nexus.

Blasted across the Daily Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are articles stating that</span> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/for-many-access-to-mental-health-resources-starts-in-college/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. is an ineffective resource</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that</span> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/c-a-p-s-to-ask-students-to-maybe-try-to-be-happy-instead-of-sad/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feels impossible to access</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Friends warn friends that C.A.P.S. is understaffed and underfunded. They inform each other that they may not be able to see a therapist for weeks and that some might not get an appointment at all. With the most “at-risk” cases — individuals with either severe mental illnesses or suicidal thoughts — prioritized, it can be difficult to secure a spot for others needing help. These issues cause students like Ace (whose name has been changed for their privacy), to ask if their problems are worth taking a space away from someone else “who might need it more.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rumors about underfunding </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appear to be close to the truth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, in recent years, C.A.P.S. has evolved to better assess student needs and match available care with available options. It is my opinion that although C.A.P.S. is doing its best to accommodate an ever-growing demand, the organization requires more funding, physical space and attention.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although C.A.P.S. is doing its best to accommodate an ever-growing demand, the organization requires more funding, physical space and attention.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before attending C.A.P.S., Ace had been suffering from depression for five years without professional help.

Regarding wait times, Osimo shares that the period between a student’s Brief Assessment (BA) and appointment varies, with 46% waiting less than 7 days, 27% waiting between 8-14 days and 11% waiting between 18-21 days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C.A.P.S. BA system, wherein a student must drop in to be “assessed” by a C.A.P.S. intake personnel, has been in place for two years. It was developed with the hope that these quick check-ins would increase the number of people C.A.P.S. can help. After this mini-therapy meeting, students with sufficient need are assigned therapy appointments, while others are recommended student groups to attend. Osimo remarks that for the BA, 90% [of students] are seen in less than one hour, 32% of students … in less than 15 minutes. And 12% of students … [are seen in] 45-60 minutes.” But since the BA has to be conducted in person, it has proven to be another area where students find difficulty accessing C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessments are usually conducted on a first-come, first-served basis. Ace remarks that students who are juggling classes and jobs are “screwed” when it comes to matching their schedules to that of C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. closes at 4:30, “and so [during] the times you might be able to go and do one of those intake appointments, [such as] around dinner— [C.A.P.S. is] not there,” Ace said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Osimo acknowledges, “it doesn’t feel good to have to wait when we are dealing with an issue.” So, to try and combat student schedules, C.A.P.S. offers 20 peer group sessions where students come together and share their experiences. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> LiveHealth, a new teletherapy service which accepts Student Health insurance, now collaborates with C.A.P.S. to connect students and therapists online (and unlike C.A.P.S and Acacia, does not have long wait times).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “We also know that not everyone needs the same thing,” Osimo continued. “Many students just need one appointment to discuss a specific goal rather than meeting multiple times for therapy.  We offer different options for different needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By acting within their budget, C.A.P.S. has attempted to help the largest amount of students possible — but as history shows they need more funding. C.A.P.S.’ lack of funding </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has been an issue since 2006,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when the Regents were presented with evidence of rising mental health issues in college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, from 2007-09 counseling programs across the UCs were granted a $12 million budget increase, achieved by raising student fees for two years (this was 28% of the initially requested $43 million dollars). They achieved decreasing the wait period for students to see a professional, but a rise in “the severity of student issues and greater demand for mental health services” continues to be a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in 2011, the University of California’s Office of the President applied for and received a $6.9 million student mental health grant funded by the California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA). Each campus was given $500,000, and the UC continued to receive CalMHSA until </span><a href=\"https://saccityexpress.com/gov-brown-vetoes-mental-health-bill-rejects-services-targeting-college-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former Governor Jerry Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vetoed it in 2016 and 2017 because the UC didn’t state an exact amount of money or a source for it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2015, the UCs have been increasing student services fees by 5% to address the lack of therapists. Because of this decision, 80% of approved new positions “have been filed across the UC system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, issues like the UC’s inability to offer competitive salaries, recruit diverse talent and maintain consistent state funds have made it difficult to fill the remaining openings. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019-2020 budget detail</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “additional funds are still needed [to hire more staff].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People want to work at places that are financially stable. So, to help our students, we need to provide more benefits for our staff.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their experience, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. does a good job of allocating its limited resources. By prioritizing people with serious mental health needs, Ace believes that even if a person is angry that they have been recommended to join a peer group rather than a one-on-one session, it’s important for students to understand that C.AP.S. is trying its best: “You got to trust in the expertise of the person sitting across from you … there’s a reason why they’re suggesting what they’re suggesting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace recalls that they used to convince themselves that they were fine because there were people out there in worse shape than them. “I sit here like, ‘Should I go to C.A.P.S.? No, I shouldn’t go to C.A.P.S. because I’m fine and I’ve never attempted suicide, I’ve only self-harmed a couple of times in my life.’ I’m really not ‘that big of a risk,’” they said, adding air quotes. “But in reality, people have told me several times now, it’s not really about being a big risk — it’s about preventing a big risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ace advises that even though it’s scary, students need to be honest to ensure that they receive proper treatment:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you go into C.A.P.S. and they’re like, ‘Have you experienced any suicidal thoughts?’ do I really want to answer this question, and then I have that moment of ‘should I lie? Should I just be like, “no, everything is fine, it’s all fine?”’ And the most important thing to do is to say [to yourself] ‘No, I’m answering this honestly’ … because at that point, if you start being honest with yourself, the person sitting across the table from you has an ‘oh, fuck’ moment and they then can understand your needs better.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time. Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one of the limitations of C.A.P.S., Ace found, is that their therapy only occurs once every other week and “that model does not work for a lot of people … which is why they try to push people into Acacia and into Santa Barbara [Behavioral Health] clinic … to get them into therapy sessions that are a bit more regular.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than being a place for long term one-on-one therapy, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. works best for those dealing with a mental health crisis. It allocates its resources to helping the most people possible, and the easiest way for them to do that is to act as a place of transition before recommending more long-term options for therapy. However, C.A.P.S.’ lack of traditional therapy is an issue at the heart of student dissatisfaction with the organization. With midterms, the quarter system and the increased likelihood of developing a mental illness in their early twenties, all students deserve the option to speak with a C.A.P.S. therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s solution to this problem is simple:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need more money. With the limited resources I don’t know what else they can do … keep putting more and more on them [and] you’re just going to crush them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s ideal for how C.A.P.S. should function involves more therapists, evening hours and the availability of weekly sessions for every student. “[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time,” Ace says. “Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ace and I are currently in C.A.P.S. therapy, I have many friends who have “given up” trying to get in. C.A.P.S. is on-campus, takes</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student insurance and is a resource promised to us by the university. Demand for mental health care has risen, and while C.A.P.S. is doing its best to help everyone, they need more. Our campus needs more. But the question is: where can we find the funding?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are having any dangerous or suicidal thoughts, please call UCSB After Hours Counseling Services at (805) 893-4411. Or please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1 (800) 273-825. Everyone deserves love and guidance. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Morley wants all students struggling with mental illness or life in general to have a safe place to go, and admires C.A.P.S. for all that they do.   </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93563\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93563\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/c-a-p-s-is-doing-its-best-but-our-campus-needs-more/","id":6471,"author":{"id":801,"name":"Hannah Morley"},"related":[6470,6469,6468],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
