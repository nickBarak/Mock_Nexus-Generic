The Gauchos pulled out a 2-1 win in Santa Barbara, but did not show as well against a strong at-home team, like Pepperdine, as the Gauchos fell 12-5 in that away game.</p>\n<p>As of this past weekend, every pitcher on the Gaucho pitching staff has had at least one inning on the mound. Through 16 total innings pitched, sophomore righty Shane Bieber has maintained a 1.13 earned run average, recorded 14 strikeouts and been the winning pitcher in both of his starting appearances.</p>\n<p>Junior righty Dillon Tate has also been a consistent starter for the Gauchos so far this season, as he has clocked 13.2 innings pitched, and has allowed no runs and put away 17 strikeouts. Tate also has two wins in his two appearances.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s core four starters have allowed 16 of the total 33 runs scored against the Waves in seven games, however, junior right-handed pitcher Jackson McClelland has accounted for none of those runs in his 13 innings pitched. McClelland has also recorded eight walks and 11 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>At bat for the Gauchos, junior infielder Dalton Kelly comes off an up-and-down series against Kentucky, as he went 3-5 with five RBIs on Saturday and 0-5 on Sunday. However, Kelly has the most at-bats on the lineup, and has gone 11-30 and scored eight runs this season.</p>\n<p>In addition, senior outfielder Cameron Newell is heating up, as he maintains a .760 batting average through two series with thirteen runs scored for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“If you try to go up there and drive in runs, you’re not going to. If you try too hard, you’re going to have bad at-bats,” Checketts said. “We’ve hit well with two outs, and runners in scoring position, but [Sunday] is the first time we didn’t have those big hits.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face the Waves at 2 p.m. in Malibu today, before they return home to face the University of Oregon in a three-game series this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/","id":4391,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4390,4389,4388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers","biography":"Not available","articles":[1411,1941,4219,4347,4348,4350,4377,4378,4379,4380,4381,4382,4383,4384,4391,4396,4397,4398,4399,4401,4402,4436,4718,4720,4727,4729,4730,4731,4732,4733,4734,4735,4736,4737,4738,4743,4751,4752,4756,4759,4760,4950,4963,5122,5164,5167,5173,5192,5195,5197,5198,5208,5211,5213,5214,5218,5220,5294,5297,5298,5311,5314],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"What You Need to Know About I.V.

The I.V. community has witnessed several movements in favor of cityhood, but the state ultimately determined these efforts to be politically and financially infeasible.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury determined that a CSD would be the best option to represent the unincorporated community.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB-3) was introduced to the state assembly in 2014 and would effectively create a new government in I.V. capable of addressing the needs of the “transient student population” and its “predominantly renter-oriented” community.</p>\n<p>The bill also assigns the CSD powers to provide services related to infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. Governor Jerry Brown signed AB-3 into law on Oct. 7, 2015, paving the way for Measure E to be on the ballot in Nov. 2016.</p>\n<p>Measure E was the ballot measure to formally create the Isla Vista CSD and was coupled on the ballot with Measure F, a utility user tax meant to fund the district through an 8 percent tax on gas, water, electricity, sewage and garbage disposal for users in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>CSD Financial Strains</strong></p>\n<p>While most of the country focused on welcoming and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-09/over-1000-uc-santa-barbara-students-protest-in-isla-vista-after-trump-elected-president/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protesting</a> a new president on Nov. 9, 2016, I.V. residents also saw the birth of a new government by voting a resounding 87.52 percent “yes” on Measure E.</p>\n<p>The measure created the Isla Vista CSD with voters electing Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan as directors to lead the newly formed government.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman described the district as an “experiment” in providing small-scale government that has the “visceral” ability for students to become involved because of its relationship with UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Measure F, however, received 61.22 percent of the total vote in favor, failing to reach the two-third (66 percent) vote necessary to impose the tax. This effectively left the CSD fundless and with little ability to finance the services it wished to provide.</p>\n<p>The failure to pass this tax is worrisome for the future of the district, as AB-3 stipulates that “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>CSD board chair Ethan Bertrand, however, remains confident in its future.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> Tuesday, Bertrand said there are plans to put the tax on the ballot once more in June or November of next year. He also said the district has received approximately $6,500 in funding from private donations, grants and contributions from Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p><strong>Establishing Governance</strong></p>\n<p>The CSD held its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first meeting in March</a> and has been meeting every two weeks since then.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the district tries to make its meetings “as interactive as possible” because it works with all aspects of the community, including students, families and businesses.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of the beauty of a small government that we have the ability to kind of work directly with [the public],” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. now has two entities directly governing it: the Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), a small body established in 1972 to regulate parks and other outdoor spaces, and the CSD, a body with broader governing powers.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the administrative framework took a long time to build but said he feels the CSD is now “getting [its] wings” as it begins to provide services.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals of the CSD</strong></p>\n<p>According to Bertrand, public safety is “the top priority,” as the CSD is working with UCSB to acquire this year’s $200,000 in annual funding for the next seven years. The university <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pledged</a> this funding during the district’s creation for “mutually agreed-upon projects, programs and services.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he is in interested in “community-oriented policing services” rather than placing sworn officers on the streets. He said he believes this will solidify the relationship between residents and law enforcement and will contribute to a decline in the amount of sexual assault in I.V., which has<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/sexual-assault-reports-up-in-i-v/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> increased in recent years</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to that sum, the district is applying for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation, a local philanthropy, and acquired $3,000 from the Fund for Santa Barbara for “community programming.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the district plans to use the funds to schedule community meetings at the Community Conference Room in I.V., currently used for CSD meetings, and loan it to organizations interested in gathering there.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the room can only be used for noncommercial purposes but said the district will not focus on the content of the meetings that happen there. Managing the room’s scheduling would be the first service the CSD provides since its creation.</p>\n<p>The CSD created an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/new-csd-interns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internship program</a> in conjunction with UCSB’s political science department in Spring Quarter, employing five interns to-date, but has not yet provided large-scale services to I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>The district’s ability to provide services has been bogged down significantly by its lack of funding, as well as its lack of structure, as it has spent several months drafting policies and developing procedures to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Hopes</strong></p>\n<p>As the CSD continues to develop and find new funding sources for the services it intends to provide, its directors express optimism toward the newborn government’s future.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the CSD was created to make I.V. a safer place and to give the community the “long-deserved voice” within local government.</p>\n<p>“This is a huge step for participatory government in I.V.,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>“If you have any interest at all in how society operates, in how all of those services that you rely on everyday [are provided] … even if we’re not the ones providing to you, we are a model by which you can learn how government functions,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/","id":4388,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4387,4386,4385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Detective Joins IVFP Following  Student Protests, Demands","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gutierrez was assigned to IVFP because of his work as a detective in the Criminal Investigations Division for one year, according to Hoover.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A full-time detective with specialized training in sexual assault investigations joined the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on Tuesday, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>Detective Julio Gutierrez is bilingual and has worked with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) for two of his 12 years in the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), according to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover. Gutierrez was assigned to IVFP because of his work as a detective in the Criminal Investigations Division for one year, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (CSD) recently considered hiring a specialized sexual assault detective for as much as $120,000.

IVFP told her that they couldn’t respond to her allegations because it was out of their jurisdiction, Earwin said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand told the <em>Nexus </em>on Wednesday that the CSD will probably wait to hire a new detective until they decide whether sexual assault cases are now being handled properly.</p>\n<p>The CSD is also considering expanding UCSB’s CSO escort program to provide more service to I.V. during high traffic nights.</p>\n<p>The cost of the escort program expansion was originally $120,000 of UCSB’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\">annual $200,000 pledged to the CSD</a>.
