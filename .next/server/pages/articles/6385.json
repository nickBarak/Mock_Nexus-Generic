But what’s that next to your nice, new shirt? Your senior class sweatshirt made of that unnaturally soft material.

Once there’s no one left in your area, the high fades away and you finish your pizza and head to bed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the morning you have a wave of new matches, and after a bit of filtering and a lot of cringing you get your first message. You go, Glenn Coco. Sure, maybe the pickup line was questionable, but then some flirtation ensues and somehow you’ve got a date. Lizzie McGuire was right — this is what dreams are made of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You go on the date and everything goes pretty well, and one or two dates later you decide to invite them back to your place. You’re not really in the mood for debauchery in your good Christian home; you genuinely just want to watch TV, but your date has other plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There you are, sitting innocently on the couch, and suddenly there’s an arm around you. This seems fine until you notice that there’s no room for Jesus left between you two. Much to your dismay, the movie ends, and all you’re left with is wandering hands and an increasingly awkward silence.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For whatever reason, sex just isn’t on the table. Maybe it’s because your date’s breath is rich with that heavenly aroma of dining commons pizza, maybe they forgot deodorant or maybe you just plain don’t want to. Nonetheless, you’ve got some great sexpectations on your hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In situations like these, I normally uncomfortably laugh and go hide in my bathroom, but I realize that’s not exactly socially acceptable, so I reached out to two other Gauchos to get their advice. First, I sat down with my friend who was brave enough to discuss her harrowing, romantic encounter with the man now known as the “One Titty Wonder.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was on a really boring date with this guy who really didn’t talk to me much at all, and when he did it was mostly just to make bad jokes with sexual innuendos. I would’ve tried to leave, but he was my ride home, and when we pulled up next to my house he stopped the car and I could tell he kind of wanted to say something.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was about to break the silence and he reached over and grabbed my boob out of my bra, so I was just sitting there with one boob hanging out of my T-shirt. After that I just kind of scooped my boob back in and skirted out of there. My advice would be to make sure that your date respects your boobs’ dignity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your date isn’t quite so invasive and you feel like you can just talk your way out of it, don’t you worry — I spoke to another anonymous Gaucho who has just the excuse you’ve been looking for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I had this cuddle buddy last year that I knew from back home. I made it clear that he was just a cuddle buddy, too, to avoid confusion. The last time I saw him was when I invited him to my room to cuddle. He started making moves and I wasn’t into it. Then he tried undoing my belt and said, ‘I wanna see your vagina.’”</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is a very sexually liberated campus, sex is always subject to consent and respect; it’s not something you can buy with a shot of Kirkland vodka or expect after a set number of dates (I know sharing nachos is an intimate experience, but please be a consensual Casanova).</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To that I brushed his hands away and got up quickly as I said I was on my period and was super heavy.

There ya go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These stories show that sex is often seen as an expectation after two or three dates, or even one if a big spender drops upwards of $10 on your food.

I found out that many girls did not receive the thorough education I thought was necessary for success. Most girls simply repeated the golden rule: no teeth. But other than that, most advice was to “just kinda go for it.” When they reflected on their experiences, the consensus seemed to be that they didn’t believe this lack of education hindered their ability to perform or caused them any more anxiety than normal during their first experience. Personally, I think hindsight blurs the anxiety they felt preceding the act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I continued the conversation with my blowjob virgin friends, who all agreed that receiving a thorough how-to walkthrough would significantly decrease their anxiety. Most of these girls told me that they had gleaned what little knowledge they had from brief conversations with friends, or from articles in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmopolitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the like. We discussed the merits of these articles and they told me how they didn’t feel like they could trust the information between the glossy pages of a national magazine when performing such an intimate act. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional sex is a team sport, as it fosters a “we’re all in this together” sort of camaraderie that takes some of the pressure off each individual participant. However, when giving oral sex all eyes are completely on you.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this talk about blowjobs and education got me thinking about how our society approaches sexual education. Sex is such a popular topic in our culture; it’s used in advertisements to sell products, it’s shown in movies and music videos, it’s discussed in the media, news and politics. But amidst all this, there’s so little discussion about sex that occurs outside of heterosexual penetrative acts </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly about the details of oral sex, or sex that falls outside of the heterosexual binary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this lack of information fueling a culture which shames these acts? After considering all of the knowledge gained from examining my own experiences, discussing the experiences of others, and pondering how our society educates the masses on this topic, I’ve come to the conclusion that the fear women feel in performing oral sex comes from a culture of embarrassment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think women should be proud of their ability to please their partner. Maybe by owning the power we wield in our positions as blowjob-givers, women will be better able to share their confidence and knowledge with those coming next. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*wink wink*</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie Offerman thinks women should share their experiences to create a new generation of epic blowjob givers. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86189\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86189\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/","id":6383,"author":{"id":782,"name":"Jackie Offerman"},"related":[6382,6381,6380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Does Birth Control Always Feel Like a Battlefield?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/male-birth-contol-art-e1559019781214.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/male-birth-contol-art-e1559019781214.png?resize=650%2C621&ssl=1","description":"Cardi Bradshaw sets the record straight on misconceptions about birth control.

I felt angry and anxious, and by the fourth week I thought I was going crazy. When I went back to CVS to pick up the next month’s prescription, the pharmacist apologized for ‘giving me the wrong prescription last month’… Instead of getting my low-estrogen pill that my doctor prescribed me, I was given a form that had weekly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases in estrogen </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and literally wrecked my physical and mental state.

As soon as I got the implant removed I was fine … same thing happened to my best friend who also had the implant.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birth control is important, and it</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> privilege</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to a </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db327.htm\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Center for Health Statistics </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “approximately 65% of women are using some type of contraceptive method.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than half of the female-identifying population is on some form of birth control. People who bear the burden of childbearing also bear the burden of preventing that. We can’t blame the people we know for not having to deal with getting pregnant. But considering the gender roles of contraception, my friend’s dad put it best: “If [cis] men could get pregnant, birth control would be as available as your nearest Starbucks.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardi Bradshaw wants male Gauchos to consider the trials and tribulations of birth control and to buy more condoms. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/","id":6384,"author":{"id":781,"name":"Cardi Bradshaw"},"related":[6383,6382,6381],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
