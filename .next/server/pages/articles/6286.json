It was my first time going back since the election, so I was hesitant yet curious to hear how some of them felt about our country’s current state. One night over drinks, one of my good girlfriends and I were venting about our disappointment, shock and repulsion over the election results. After relieving our political frustration, we switched topics to her new boyfriend that she is absolutely smitten over. I was feeling so much joy for her as she endlessly listed his positive qualities and kind gestures when she suddenly mentioned that he was a very active supporter of Trump.</p>\n<p>I sat there, puzzled, as I tried to process this information. After everything we had just discussed, how is it possible that she could be so into someone who views life in such a different light? How could she be so invested in a relationship with someone who could have such different beliefs and values? Of course, I believe that coexistence and amiability is possible amongst those of differing political viewpoints, but love? Sex? Marriage? I mean, let’s be honest: This election was not typical. It was full of extremes, and a lot of extremes that affect women, specifically. For most people, this election wasn’t just a matter of being fiscally conservative or wanting lower taxes. Casting a vote for Donald Trump meant a lot more than that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe that coexistence and amiability is possible amongst those of differing political viewpoints, but love? Sex? Marriage?</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are living in a time of intense opposition and frustration. Ultimately, I truly do believe that all of this will lead to positive change, but right now people have to speak out. They have to be honest about what they feel and believe. Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall on, the issues that are currently on the table are far too big to be brushed under the rug. Trying to start a relationship with someone who you can’t discuss these intense topics with isn’t going to lead to any sort of steady foundation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>People often say that opposites attract. But really, how accurate is that? Sure, we like people that are different. Sometimes it’s nice and necessary to have others balance us out and open our eyes to differing thoughts and views. But when it comes to our core values, they can’t be too far off. Having such fundamental differences is extremely difficult to get past and will most likely result in someone changing or caving in order to make the relationship work. Having a real relationship with someone means that you plan on growing with them. It means that you plan on becoming better as individuals together. I don’t see how that can be possible between two people who have completely different ideas about what constitutes growth and improvement.</p>\n<p>One of the most prominent topics being debated at the moment is that of a woman’s right to have control over her body and health care. Call me crazy, but it seems pretty absurd to be sleeping with someone who holds the opposite view of you on an issue as heavy as this. In my opinion, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, the person that you are having sex with must share the same opinion. It doesn’t matter if it’s a casual hookup or a serious, long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>All in all, having sex can lead to consequences, one of them being unwanted pregnancy. Even when you’re careful and responsible, accidents can happen. If it does, it’s pertinent that both parties be at least somewhat on the same page. While I personally believe that the ultimate choice is that of the females, knowing where your partner stands on the issue can save a lot grief and pain.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In my opinion, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, the person that you are having sex with must share the same opinion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are woman who is pro-life, and could never bring yourself to make the decision to terminate a pregnancy, then the guy that you’re sleeping with should share the same mindset. If you are a woman who believes that she has the option to do what she pleases with her body, then you probably shouldn’t be sleeping with someone who voted against you having that choice. How can you be comfortable sharing your body with someone who doesn’t believe in the rights that you have to it? It’s a dynamic that is far too complicated and serious to risk.</p>\n<p>While it is true that people can change one another and open our minds to new ways of thought and belief, trying to force change upon the person you desire isn’t going to result in happiness for either of you. Having a relationship that thrives, challenges and inspires you requires that your fundamental values and beliefs be in alignment. Being able to connect on not only a physical and emotional level, but also on one of intellect will, without a doubt, result in the strongest and most rewarding of bonds. So don’t let yourself settle. Don’t allow yourself to be with someone who makes you feel inferior. We are facing tumultuous times that will be made much easier with the support and affirmation of those we hold closest.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos hopes you and yours are on the same page politically. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/","id":6286,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6285,6284,6283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos","biography":"Not available","articles":[6284,6286,6292,6299,6301,6303,6304,6305,6308,6342,6362],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Profiling Peter Saraf: The Man Behind Little Miss Sunshine","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2019-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tumblr_inline_nqf07aSFDN1rzgokx_1280.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tumblr_inline_nqf07aSFDN1rzgokx_1280.jpg?resize=738%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A producer's reflections on the Oscars, mainstream movies and following his passion for film. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of us not entrenched in the world of sports, the Oscars have the tendency to be our Super Bowl. We host viewing parties, place bets on winning nominees and dissect the newcomers and veterans with an equal sense of spectacle. The Academy Awards hold a reputation of launching the careers of unknowns who metamorphose into Hollywood giants before our very eyes.  We’ve seen nominees like Hailee Steinfeld, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quvenzhané Wallis and this year’s newcomer Yalitza Aparicio transform their careers solely based off of Oscar buzz. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is apparent that this fanaticism does not stray from the stars of the pictures. Ask anyone to name you a producer of the film — a nominee of the coveted Best Picture Oscar — and they would likely balk.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For somebody who was nominated for the crème de la crème of awards, Peter Saraf is breathtakingly humble. He does not fit the image of a fast-paced, no-nonsense Hollywood producer. Saraf, his wife Erika, their teenage children Olive and Oscar and their schneagle Harry, live in a renovated two-story apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, just a stone’s throw from Central Park. The apartment walls are adorned with Erika’s paintings, as well as many done by her father, renowned painter Daniel E. Greene. There is no doubt that the Sarafs are certainly well off (a two-story apartment in Manhattan should have clued you in), yet their home is cozy and inviting — they know their doorman and their neighbors — practically the polar opposite of the fenced-in mega-mansions synonymous with reclusive members of the entertainment industry on the opposite coast.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf’s introduction to the film industry was no coincidence; his late father Irving Saraf was a quadruple-hyphenate producer-director-editor-academic, as well as an Academy Award-winning documentarian for his 1991 film “In the Shadow of the Stars”. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Saraf was in high school he had the opportunity to work as a production assistant on some of his father’s films, and get a better sense of his career. Make no mistake though, coming from a film dynasty did not pressure young Peter into his career in the entertainment industry — in fact sharing such a binding love of film with his father is what allowed Saraf a unique appreciation for the power of movies later in his career: “He and I shared a lot. We saw a lot of movies together, and that was just something that we did together all the time from as far back as I can remember,” he said with a twinge of admiration in his voice. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life,” he said. After wandering about overseas, working odd production jobs and unsuccessful attempts to go to film school, Saraf found himself back in New York where he managed to get a job as an office manager for Jonathan Demme, who was best known as the director of the cult classic psychological horror film, “The Silence of the Lambs.” Saraf ended up working with Demme for 10 years: “It was my film school, it was my job, it’s where I learned really what a producer does, and where I learned that I liked producing and that I had a certain affinity for it.” He rose through the ranks from an office manager to producing documentaries, to narratives, to eventually becoming a partner of Demme’s and producing projects together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf has always had a knack for telling stories about human beings, and “Little Miss Sunshine” proved to be no exception. Many will fondly remember “Little Miss Sunshine” as the screamingly funny, horrifically inappropriate family road trip comedy that follows the Hoover family as they try to make it to Redondo Beach, Calif. for their daughter Olive to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The beloved script was well known and had been floating around industry purgatory for years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many found the film too risky to make: it was an R-rated comedy with an ensemble cast, with the plot centered on a child and it was unlikely to have a strong international audience, as child beauty pageants are a uniquely American cultural phenomenon.  In 2004, Saraf and his partner Marc Turtletaub co-founded their production company Big Beach. Turtletaub, who had been a developer of the script, dreamt of making the screenplay a reality. “We managed to get it back from the studio that owned it that wasn’t making it, and made it independently,” Saraf said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie was filmed over the course of 30 days and premiered at Sundance in January 2006. In addition to scoring one of the best distribution deals of the festival and raking in $100.5 million at the box office, “Little Miss Sunshine” received rave reviews and heaps of nominations during the awards circuit that year, so Saraf and Turtletaub were eager to see if it would make the cut for the top five of the Academy Awards Best Picture nominees (which expanded in 2009 to include up to 10 films). </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86818\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26suns.2.600.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"860773318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86816\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86818\" data-attachment-id=\"86818\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/profiling-peter-saraf-the-man-behind-little-miss-sunshine/26suns-2-600/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26suns.2.600.jpg?fit=600%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"26suns.2.600\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;A still from the 2004 cult classic Little Miss Sunshine.

Courtesy of The New York Times.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achieving a nomination for Best Picture, as Saraf and Turtletaub accomplished with “Little Miss Sunshine,” however, is arguably the most daunting task of the entire Oscars process. Academy voter Curtis Clark explains that of the 24 branches of the Academy — which one joins on an invite-only basis — each branch is only responsible for nominations within its own domain, with the exception of Best Picture, which is the only category to receive nominations from all branches across the board. Clark is a renowned cinematographer and a recent recipient of the</span><a href=\"https://oscar.go.com/news/oscar-news/curtis-clark-to-receive-john-a-bonner-award\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which is awarded by the Academy) for his exemplary contributions to the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf and Clark are quick to note the honor of being nominated for an Academy Award, but neither believes that it makes an enormous impact, career-wise. Clark acknowledges that for somebody who is not a member of the Academy, “it may have distinct opportunities for certain types of jobs,” but Saraf does not believe that his nomination has opened any doors for him, though “it doesn’t hurt to have ‘Oscar nominee’ associated with your name,” he admitted. He continued with a chuckle, “I say I’m an Oscar loser.” Saraf believes the true mark of success is the endurance of the movie over time. “People remember the movie more than it was nominated, and that to me is much more meaningful and impactful. I love that people still remember the movie and care about it and continue to watch it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The industry (and world) wide celebration of film and its unifying properties is what Saraf appreciates the most about awards season. He loves that the awards circuit seeks to honor the movies every year, and that its popularity amongst the laypeople signifies a much deeper connection. He does admit, however, that there is a nastier, political side of awards season that viewers are unaccustomed to seeing or hearing about. In Saraf’s eyes, this petty side of awards season is what detracts from its value; it is the antithesis of the pure, wholesome love of film that he grew up on when seeing double features with his father.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seriousness of the Oscars — and its implications as a marketing tool for an extended life at the box office — has earned the entertainment industry an insurmountable sum of money, but has led to a more sinister side to what should ultimately be a celebration for achievement in film. “That gets translated into literally the kinds of things you would see in a political campaign. You have consultants who do opposition research on other movies and the people behind them,” he said. This “oppo research” includes digging up old tweets, unflattering quotes, accusations, allegations about the film’s credibility and so other kinds of dirty tricks you’d only imagine to find on a political drama (see this year’s hotly contested Best Picture winner “Green Book” for </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/green-book-oscar-chances-peter-farrelly-nick-vallelonga-controversies/580087/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prime examples</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of all of these).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The night of the Oscars doesn’t stand out as incredibly sharp in Saraf’s mind. He noted the foreign experience of being on the most impressive, star-studded red carpet in the world, but feeling completely invisible — even as a nominee for the most anticipated award of the program. He recalled being a bundle of nerves, the torturous feeling of being the last award of the night and the ridiculousness of the cash-only bar in the lobby (you’d think the most prestigious awards in the industry could splurge on free booze).</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was actually a little terrified that we were going to win because I was so nervous to be on that stage,” he said with a hearty laugh, before admitting that it was a disappointing loss, regardless.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf’s work has remained more of the indie variety since his nomination 12 years ago. Things seem to be looking big for Big Beach this year, however. Saraf and Turtletaub are loaded with projects in post-production as well as some in the works, including a Mr. Roger’s film starring Tom Hanks set to premier at Thanksgiving, “The Farewell” starring Hollywood breakout Awkwafina which premiered to rave reviews at Sundance and upcoming projects with Lasse Holström and Natalie Portman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is impossible to compare the works of fellow nominees, being nominated alongside Clint Eastwood and Alejandro González Iñárritu must certainly create a sense of pressure and pride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Saraf has often chosen to go off the beaten path and pursue the indie genre, it appears that maybe more than a decade after his Best Picture nomination he will find himself back in the mainstream. “There’s a bunch of stuff coming – I’m not exactly sure what we’re going to make next, but that’s what’s in the pipeline,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf isn’t feeling overwhelmed by pressure to earn another nomination, but rather he is continuing to do what he does best: tell the stories of human beings. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

It is a time when sentiment and emotion fill the air. Whether you’re a Scrooge who thinks the holiday season is just one big marketing scheme or a Christmas fanatic who puts their tree up in October, I think it’s safe to say this time of year causes a lot of us to reminisce and reflect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, being single during a time of so much love and connection can lead to feelings of loneliness or fear. It’s pretty much impossible to escape the constant romance and adoration filling every street corner, movie and song. On top of that, it’s cuddle weather 24/7. Getting through December can be rough for many, but nothing comes close to the stress of facing the dreaded New Year’s Kiss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not sure who came up with idea of a New Year’s Kiss, but it’s never been one of my favorite holiday traditions. Don’t get me wrong; I think the concept of it is great. It’s meant to be nothing more than a positive and light-hearted way to kick off a fresh start. In fact, New Year’s Eve is probably my favorite night of the entire year. I just hate the pressure that comes with wondering if you’ll be getting that kiss at midnight. Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For some people, that’s part of the fun; not knowing with whom or how you’re going to jump into the next 365 days. I’ve definitely had years in which I went into the night with that mentality and I came out the next day feeling like my year started off on a pretty good note.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the clock ticks closer to 12, it can be pretty comical to watch others search the room aimlessly for a potential comrade. If you haven’t locked one down by 11:50 p.m., you might be in some trouble. As the bar begins to shout “10, 9, 8, 7…” humans of all kinds come together to share that special and sometimes awkward midnight moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner. Considering the fact that I’ve never been in a relationship on New Year’s Eve, these have always been my go-to tactics, and they seem to have worked out decently. Plus, any time I felt that twinge of disappointment, I would tell myself: There’s always next year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year, I feel a little differently about getting that kiss at midnight. This year, I don’t really have any desire to enter into 2017 with some meaningless, drunk kiss. As cliché as it sounds, the New Year can truly mean a new chapter. For some of us, it can be the motivation we need to make real and difficult changes in our lives. It can be what inspires us to work toward being the best versions of ourselves. Maybe some years, you’re really meant to celebrate your fresh start with just you, and not a stranger in a bar.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While strangers in bars can be fun, they can’t come close to giving you the joy you can give yourself. They also can’t replace the void that’s been left by the person you wish you were kissing at midnight. If you’re one of those people who aren’t just dealing with being single on New Year’s, but also with being heartbroken, it can be a double dose of hurt. It’s pretty much impossible not to wonder who they’ll be kissing when the clock strikes 12, and you know you’ll be wishing it were you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, circumstance and timing just don’t allow for miracles to happen, even during the holidays. While this reality can be frustrating and difficult to face, it doesn’t mean you should settle. If you know in your heart how you feel, and who you feel it for, not one person in that bar is going to fill that void. Not one person in that bar is going live up to your expectations. Not one person in that bar is going to give you the kiss you actually want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, some years we actually do get that movie-moment kiss and fantasize about what the next 365 days may hold. Other years we end the night by tucking ourselves in bed, reminiscing on the 365 days that just passed. This year, I know that no matter what 2017 may bring, I have myself to face it with. Being secure and confident in yourself is one of the most difficult yet important lessons we are forced to learn as humans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving love and acceptance toward ourselves means we know who we are and what we stand for, regardless of mistakes or faults we may posses. It means you don’t need anyone other than yourself to feel validated and valued.  </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not getting that kiss at midnight doesn’t matter because you started your year off with someone who can never be replaced: you. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74641\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74641\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/","id":6284,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6283,6282,6281],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Why Facebook is the G.O.A.T. of Social Media Platforms","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Virtual Reality","publish_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fbvsinsta_illus.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fbvsinsta_illus.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tali Braun passionately argues for a return to Facebook.

I, too, find myself criticizing every photo I take in an attempt to make it “Insta-perfect” — or at least adequately edited and appropriately captioned.  However, when it comes down to it, I would much rather scroll through Facebook or pin recipes on Pinterest. Call me old fashioned, but I find myself missing the olden days of social media when we weren’t so focused on aesthetics and unattainable ideals. It was a time that produced real and intimate content.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scrolling through my Instagram profile — including the archive section, where my most embarrassing posts continue to haunt me — I noticed apparent shifts in the aesthetics of my profile. Looking back, I remember just snapping a photo and uploading it to my Instagram profile right away, writing whatever caption came to mind at that moment and not editing anything. My oldest posts include a photo with my parents at my middle school graduation and a photo documenting the moment I found out I got into my first-choice high school. However, these innocent and intimate photos changed as I got older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who remembers the infamous white-border Instagram trend? This was the trend that started the obsession with curating an “aesthetic” profile. I remember furiously downloading the Squaready app that my friends told me about and learning about the different filters that would lighten your photo to match the “white aesthetic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon enough, other editing conventions replaced white borders. Facetune launched alongside a torrent of other airbrushing apps. Now I find myself scrolling through overly edited photos of popular Instagram models and influencers, many of whom look the same because they all see Dr. Nassif in Beverly Hills or schedule monthly visits with aesthetician and lip-filler connoisseur Joanna “the Nurse” Yoo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After scrolling through repetitive, overly curated content on platforms like Instagram, I find myself seeking refuge in Facebook’s feel-good content. I can’t even tell you how many times I have teared up watching videos of soldiers coming home to surprise their families or how many Tasty cooking videos I have saved on my profile. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook is the mother of social media platforms — a long-lost gem among social media platforms in an age centered around unrealistic expectations and overly curated content.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Facebook </span><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remains the most popular social media platform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with over </span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.45 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> active monthly users, its user demographics have drastically shifted in recent years.

As such, photos posted on Facebook are generally more “authentic” than those posted on platforms such as Instagram. While in 2018 Facebook changed its algorithm to prioritize consumers, Instagram </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/technology/instagram-algorithm-change.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wanted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its feed to “feel more fresh” and changed its algorithm to boost newer posts to the top of users’ feeds. To me, it’s very clear that on Facebook users are more concerned about sharing their genuine lives with their friends and families than impressing the masses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t believe me, just open up your Facebook and Instagram feeds and compare the two. I guarantee that countless beautiful, nearly naked Instagram models populate your Explore page, promoting various brands that you’ve probably never heard of. Looking at your Facebook home page, you might see your cousin who lives out of state post photos from her baby shower, or you may see a status update that one of your friends got the job they’ve been hoping for. This here is the difference between their respective contents: commercial versus real. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram is mainly used for flaunting aesthetic photos, Twitter is primarily for snarky commentary and TikTok is for short quirky videos. Facebook combines them all: It can be used for keeping up with old friends, reading the news and professional networking. It is also a direct feeder for other social media platforms. For example, you can find a lot of content from Twitter on your Instagram feed. You can also connect your Instagram posts to your Facebook profile, share your Pins and repost your Tweets on your Facebook Timeline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook is the mother of social media platforms — a long-lost gem among social media platforms in an age centered around unrealistic expectations and overly curated content. When you find yourself feeling insecure after scrolling through your Instagram feed or spending way too much time stalking Chrissy Teigen’s Twitter profile, check in with your long-lost friend, Facebook. Maybe catch up on some news, or see what your forgotten middle school and high school classmates are up to. Who knows, you might be surprised at what you find.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tali Braun believes that Facebook is the most forgotten yet most wholesome social media platform of our generation. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/why-facebook-goat-social-media-platforms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/why-facebook-goat-social-media-platforms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/why-facebook-goat-social-media-platforms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/why-facebook-goat-social-media-platforms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/why-facebook-goat-social-media-platforms/","id":6285,"author":{"id":791,"name":"Tali Braun"},"related":[6284,6283,6282],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
