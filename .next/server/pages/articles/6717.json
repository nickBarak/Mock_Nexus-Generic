But tonight a variety of students found themselves in Campbell Hall long past 8 p.m. enjoying the fusion of the sitar and tabla drums along with the rest of the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was fortunate enough to host Zakir Hussain, one of the world’s most acclaimed tabla drummers. The tabla is a traditional Hindustani instrument that consists of a bass and high drum and requires intense training to skillfully play (with a complex series of finger and palm motions). Rising star Niladri Kumar accompanied Hussain on the sitar, which he specially modified to be an electrical “zitar.”</p>\n<p>As I walked toward Campbell Hall, it was obvious the building had been taken over and class was no longer in session. The enormous trees that often provide shade to studious students or the weekly farmers market were all lit up with blue and purple lights to signify a grand cultural show was about to commence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Upon arrival to the venue, I found a group of audience members following the instructions and dance moves of two Bollywood dancers. Arts &amp; Lectures had provided the audience members with a preshow treat; if one was brave enough they could partake in this dance mob and learn the Indian dance moves. Despite the slightly uncoordinated dancing, it was entertaining to watch because there was a sense of unity and commitment in learning this unique dance style.</p>\n<p>Once inside the theater, it was very difficult to separate school life from pleasure. The stage was set up in a very minimalistic manner, with an elevated platform for the artists to perform on. There was nothing to act as a backdrop so the audience sat in anticipation for the act to stimulate us musically.</p>\n<p>The crowd was made up of an even range of students and a various mix of adults from the Santa Barbara community. After some eavesdropping and recognizing students from my world music class, it was easy to deduct many under the age of 25 were attending the concert for a class requirement. Those over 25 remained a mystery for the rest of the night; some seemed to be genuine fans, but the sheer range and diversity of this age group indicated this duo inspired an eclectic group.</p>\n<p>When Hussain and Kumar finally stepped on stage it was much anticipated and well-received by the audience. The internationally acclaimed drummer blessed the stage as he ascended the platform, because, as he remarked later speaking to this quarter’s World Music class, “music is sacred.”</p>\n<p>For those of us who were not so educated in the process of Indian music, Hussain kindly spent a few minutes explaining the structure of the performance. He added a flare of his personality to this speech by livening up the audience and the performance with a bit of humor.</p>\n<p>In an improvised performance that was over two hours long, excluding the 10-minute intermission, only four songs were played.</p>\n<p>The first song was purely sitar and highlighted the talents of Kumar. This left many perplexed, as they had been under the impression Zakir Hussain was the star of the show whom everyone had congregated to this venue to see. But it was further explained by the pair that the sitar takes the lead in the song and acts as the “quarterback” the tabla accompanies.</p>\n<p>The first song had a long and lustrous build that left the spectators wondering what was happening and whether Hussain was ever going to play. But the slow build was worth the wait because the song had multiple climatic points that were extraordinarily impressive. The mad sitar player commanded the instrument with such skill and moved his hands across an overwhelmingly large instrument in a way that left viewers on the edge of their seats. In the middle of his solo performance he took smooth moments to tune his instrument; after over 30 minutes of this, Kumar joked this was the “long sound check we start the concert on.”</p>\n<p>After the “sound check” the concert transitioned into what everyone was anticipating and waiting for: the inclusion of the tabla. The team finally unified and played their instruments independently and harmoniously to one another. They would look to each other for affirmation to move onto the next segment of the song or to check in to make sure one was not overpowering the other, but they were also each happily in their own element, enjoying the dramatic solos they enabled each other to play.</p>\n<p>After an intense hour full of music and a responsive audience, the two called for a short intermission that was well-deserved.</p>\n<p>The second half of the show was just as long as the preceding first half. This section of the show was faster and more vibrant, which I did not think was at all possible after witnessing the more plaintive first portion.</p>\n<p>The tabla was the focus of the second segment of the show. Hussain really honed in on his talents and impressed the audience with his inhuman drumming capabilities. The way he played so many beats at once on the cultural drums by using different parts of his hands to strike the drum was astounding, and the will he had over his hands controlling how fast the tempo played was incredible.</p>\n<p>The concert ended on a cacophony of sounds that highlighted the capabilities of both the sitar and the tabla players. The finale was so tense and dramatic that when it finally concluded the audience leapt from their seats in uproar, releasing the tension they contained while witnessing such an innovative performance.</p>\n<p>In reflection of the performance, second-year Kristine Kazangyan stated, “I thought it was super cool how they played Norwegian wood.” She brought up stylistic elements I hadn’t even noticed: “It was cool that they fused traditional and pop music in that moment.” The duo had taken their traditional sound and made it accessible to the younger audience.</p>\n<p>The good vibes kept rolling into the next day because I was fortunate enough to have the two musicians visit as guest performers in my world music class. The two gave my class a lecture on what music meant to them and how they have struggled as Indian and world musicians. They concluded their visit with a personal private performance that was greatly appreciated by the class and faculty.</p>\n<p>The sacred pair impacted the audience in Campbell hall and the students in my music class alike. The take-home message Hussain conveyed through his music and vocalized in the class was “world music is an evolving entity, not a fixed routine.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_73808\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"758785927\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73807\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73808\" data-attachment-id=\"73808\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/zakir-hussain-taps-whirlwind-beats-at-al-performance/bhangra-dance-workshop-by-ucsb-dhadkan-campbell-hall-nov-1st-2016/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?fit=6000%2C3750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6000,3750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bhangra Dance Workshop by UCSB Dhadkan, Campbell Hall, Nov 1st 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73808\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057-250x156.jpg?resize=800%2C500\" alt=\"Hari Patel / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73808\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hari Patel / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The festival was held all day on Saturday and was open to all who wanted to pay respect to loved ones or socialize with people from the community.</p>\n<p>Just outside the building were booths offering a variety of themed activities, one of which was face painting. The people within the booth talked happily while one artist focused on painting a sugar skull on a little girl, who excitedly kicked her feet back and forth from her spot upon her chair. A second booth sold dresses and purses, as well as sugar skull tapestries. The last booth sold offerings such as rosaries and, right next to the Virgin Mary candles, shot glasses for the ofrendas, or ritual altars.</p>\n<p>The small venue was filled to the brim with Day of the Dead decorations. Paper marigolds were placed in every available space, paper streamers lined the walls, two shelves were used to present giant paper mache sugar skulls and a large, hollow cross filled with sugar skulls hung on the wall. At the end of the main hall, there was an impressive display of a graveyard that included tombstones, streamers and pictures of loved ones, all enclosed by a picket fence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Ofrendas lined every wall, covering every inch of the space with a colorful collection of offerings. Each altar held several pictures of relatives past and was well-spread with decorations of fruit, candles, pan de muerto (or bread of the dead) and various items the deceased enjoyed in life. One ofrenda in particular held a black-and-white picture of a man in his late 50s, propped up next to a classic glass bottle of Coca Cola and a crumpled pack of Marlboro cigarettes. This simple but sweet display was enough to get anyone to smile. On a separate altar was a framed photo of a teenage girl wearing a yellow dress; on the frame was a yellow bow to match. Several magazines were placed close by. A larger ofrenda was placed toward the middle of the venue and was labeled “Our Future Leader.” This altar had the most pictures; the most prominent was a group photo of about 10 smiling men. People not only paid respect to loved ones who have passed, but also to those who have had influences on their lives. On a long table in the corner of the venue was a picture of Frederick Douglass and beside it was a display of Bob Marley; the display was crafted out of a shoe box and decorated with Jamaica’s national colors.</p>\n<p>The folks around the festival all had smiles on their faces as they not only enjoyed each other’s company but also enjoyed plates full of tamales, tacos and other delicious smelling food. The energetic live music flowed through the building and echoed off the walls. Although the band was not the center of attention at the celebration, they still enjoyed playing for children, parents and families. They danced around the small stage and gave huge smiles to everyone around. There were a few people scattered throughout the crowd who appeared to take a special liking to the music, and showed their appreciation by nodding their heads or tapping their feet. The sugar-skull-sweet experience of Dia de los Muertos left me with a smile on my face and a warm feeling in my chest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/","id":6714,"author":{"id":707,"name":"Kelly McPhail"},"related":[6713,6712,6711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"WebsterX and Milwaukee’s Hip Hop Renaissance","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=937%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Injury Reserve and WebsterX share a dynamic of creating spaces to craft seamlessly gravitative rap songs that are entirely divergent from their contemporaries.

Incorporating introspective subject matter into refined and precise production exemplifies the masterful work on the album as well as the artist’s previous project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desperate Youth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The enticing tempos that sway from the melodic “Underground” to the hard-hitting “Heaven’s Gates” constantly keep the listener enthralled, rather than merely falling victim to the problem that many of his contemporaries face of utilizing the same generic FL studios bass-heavy beat. WebsterX’s thought-provoking lyricism derives from a genuinely honest perspective, so it resonates vividly with his listeners. He is a symbol of originality in the rap world, as his diverse take on production and poignant content converge to form utter uniqueness.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is titled as such for two reasons, one being the visual reason. I like how the word looks and sounds. My friend Kenny captioned a photo ‘Daymares’ and posted it. I saw the word and immediately gravitated towards it and knew right then and there it’d be the title of my debut project,” he explained. “The second reason being the meaning behind it. Daymares are nightmares that are happening during the day, and the album touches on the first and only real big dark period I went through in my life, in years 2014-2015, in that 2013-2017 period of my career thus far. I couldn’t function much during the day because I was plagued by my first experience with depression, anxiety, self-doubt and simple growing pains, worrying about dropping out of school to pursue music and having to tell my parents that, because music was going crazy for me locally. Worrying about the large local reception of my debut mixtape </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desperate Youth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and how to follow up, all that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2014 single “Doomsday” has garnered north of one million streams on Spotify and induced the buzz that established WebsterX as a significant presence in the minds of many music fans and critics. The artist’s delivery on the track is innovative and captivating. Ominously enchanting cadences float above the track’s instrumentation and blend with the artist’s light falsetto, confirming the track as an enthralling hit, despite its dark lyricism. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebsterX explained, “‘Doomsday’ was written during that dark period of mine, originally intended to be the first single for the first version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I made and eventually scrapped; it blew up pretty much from the blogs. The video that I made with my videographers Damien Blue and Cody LaPlant also set the song ablaze; they do all my videos and absolutely go crazy. The song sits over a million now on Spotify and is the reason for kickstarting my career into national attention.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creative process for WebsterX emanates from writing in a peaceful state of mind while concurrently reflecting on any hardship he previously encountered. WebsterX said, “ I can only write from a happy, driven and calm perspective. So during the depressed and anxious-ridden points, I never wrote. Once I overcame that period I reflected and wrote about it all from a clearer perspective, which made </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the last question I mentioned I scrapped a first version of the project; that would be because I tried writing it from a dark mindset, and to me it was just too dark and slow. The version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that is out today is more of a life album because lyrically it’s not all about that dark period in time.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78439\" style=\"width: 587px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2054044219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78439\" data-attachment-id=\"78439\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/websterx-and-milwaukees-hip-hop-renaissance/unnamed-43/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=792%2C1406&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,1406\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=577%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78439\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-577x1024.jpg?resize=577%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=577%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1 141w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?w=792&amp;ssl=1 792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of WebsterX</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of writing in this clear mindset, rather than one submerged in calamity, ultimately made a project that depicts a narrative of a young man experiencing the trials and tribulations of adult life, specifically addressing the tangible effects of sadness on one’s mental state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of WebsterX’s parents are Ethiopian immigrants, making him a first-generation American, but he is not the first in his family to pursue a career in music. About how his roots in Ethiopian culture impacted his creativity, he said, “Ethiopia is a one-of-a-kind place in Africa and around the world. It’s looked at as a mecca to some Rastafarians, the cradle and start of humanity to the science world and a place full of beautiful people, music and culture to me. My parents are both Ethiopian; my father was a professional club soccer player and famous musician in the country and my mother’s side of the family is a coffee business of royalty. My father without knowing it instilled kindness, wiseness, love and creativity into me. My mother brought toughness, empathy for people and directness to me. With that I feel I balance both very well, and my older sister put me onto all the cool stuff I know today at a very early age.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kid Cudi reflected on melancholic realities with progressive instrumentation and cathartic flow that pushed musical boundaries, thus making him one of the top influential rappers for younger generations. The Milwaukee rapper WebsterX cited Kid Cudi as one of his major influences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kid Cudi emerged at a time when people who were born between 1990-1997 were experiencing middle school and high school,” he said. “For a rapper to come out with this lonely stoner, cosmic tone to his music and a melodic delivery along with good-feel raps, he simply had the relatable factor on his side.” He continued, “Being associated with Kanye was also crucial because Kanye was running our generation’s iPods at the time and pretty much still does. Cudi’s music was also very chorus-driven; [which was] a big and addictive reason why I think they resonated with a lot of people, including me. From his style to the music, he felt like one of us even though he was 24 at the time that this was all happening for him.” Similarly, WebsterX has crafted his own unconventional style, yet he remains an impactful voice that is simultaneously emphatic and relatable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, WebsterX joined his friends from Injury Reserve to perform a couple of live shows around the SoCal area. “IR are the super homies,” he said. “Those dudes [and] their team are incredibly talented and everyone who is fortunate enough to realize that, realizes it. They didn’t teach me anything necessarily, but what was happening was more of a realization of who they are as people and why their music sounds the way it does. Both camps got closer and still retain that relationship to this day. To me, they’re one of the most refreshing, straightforward, exciting groups out today. Both of our shows in Cali were major, especially the LA show, sheesh.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Injury Reserve and WebsterX share a dynamic of creating spaces to craft seamlessly gravitative rap songs that are entirely divergent from their contemporaries. They are the embodiments of unapologetically challenging what rap </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sound like, as they offer sonically experimental tracks with progressive lyrics that open up thoughtful conversation about themes that are relatively taboo in the rap realm, such as depression and insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A rapper and his hometown go hand-in-hand like a symbiotic pair; take Chance the Rapper and Chicago, Jay Z and New York, Kendrick Lamar and Compton for example. WebsterX hails from the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city that is stereotypically known more for its cheese than for being a forerunner in producing rap artists. WebsterX explained his deeply rooted origins in the city of Milwaukee and the distinct passion he holds for the location, citing a plethora of exemplary and incredible artists to come out of the Milwaukee community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Milwaukee is a full-blown city, fifth largest in the midwest,” he said. “Briefly, Milwaukee can be described by its four locations: North, West, East and Southside. Northside is predominantly black. Southside is predominately Latino. Eastside is the coming-of-age college town, yuppy central and affordable hip neighborhood. Riverwest is where all the music is popping mostly out of the city across all genres and downtown Milwaukee is on the Eastside mostly. The Westside is sort of jokingly no man’s land, a mixture of north and west. If you were coming from out of town, mostly everyone would recommend the Eastside of Milwaukee to you for artistic spaces, live music, sporting events, pretty much everything entertainment wise. The Eastside brews and takes in the majority of the indie pop/rock, folk, metal, hip hop, rap, etc. acts in the city. We have our fair share of bigger acts coming out of Milwaukee as a whole such as IshDARR (Northside), myself (Eastside), Vinyl Theatre, who is on tour with Twenty One Pilots right now (Eastside), Field Report, a slight extension of Bon Iver (Eastside) [and] Grace Weber (Eastside) who was on Chance’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coloring Book, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as well as the very talented acts and personal favorites of mine who are really on the come up: Zed Kenzo, Taj Raiden, Platinum Boys, Soul Low, Milo, Foreign Goods, Boodah DARR, Kane and my collective New Age Narcissism consisting of Siren, Lex Allen, Lorde Freddee and Q the Sun. If you ask me about Milwaukee I’m gonna need a few paragraphs; I know too much.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78440\" style=\"width: 692px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1389042588\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78440\" data-attachment-id=\"78440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/websterx-and-milwaukees-hip-hop-renaissance/unnamed-1-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=937%2C1406&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"937,1406\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78440\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1-682x1024.jpg?resize=682%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=937&amp;ssl=1 937w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of WebsterX</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We asked WebsterX about the difficulties that accompany a music career founded in such a city as Milwaukee. “The only thing that’s difficult is there are no real resources here,” he said. “You really gotta do it yourself or with friends. There’s lack of management, no booking agents, not many all-age venues and more. However, due to the recent successes of a lot of emerging acts, Milwaukee as a whole, musically, is being looked at more from the outside, and radio stations, venues [and] publications are aiding the local scene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rapper’s insight highlights something that is distinct in a multitude of artists from the area: an independent, DIY approach to creative expression. This element of creativity is something that has further expedited Milwaukee down the path of musical recognition and imbued the city with a distinct character.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to his own work, WebsterX harbors a refined and intriguing taste in art. Highlighting some of his current choices in music and film, the artist stated, “Musically I’m into </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Frank Ocean, Injury Reserve’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Floss </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project, Playboi Carti’s tape, Syd’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sampha’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAMN. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Kendrick Lamar, but then again that changes each day. I always tell people to pay attention to my Soundcloud ‘likes,’ too, to see what I’m listening to. My taste in film really boils down to indie films, horror, coming-of-age films, documentaries and the occasional chick flick. My favorite films are the ones that are shot well, look ahead of their time visually or think ahead of their time. As you can see, I’m into lots of different things in my life.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a climate of perpetually evolving sound, WebsterX has asserted himself as an ingenious, thoughtful and inspiring force in the rap scene. The artist’s career will surely evolve in upcoming years, as he garners more momentum each day, expanding the preexisting network of connections that have been made with artists who will help shape the future direction of contemporary hip hop. In essence, WebsterX exhibits a refreshing sense of open-mindedness and innovation with his music, contributing content that is pensive and impactful to the rap community. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.

Currently, the rapper/business mogul is established as one of hip hop’s most prominent and influential figures, even being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame last month. In the wake of his induction, Jay-Z announced the release date of his 13th studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which dropped on June 30. The release of this particular record is an interesting creative pivot for Jay-Z. Peering into the methodological, meticulous disposition of the record highlights the direction in which contemporary music presentation could be headed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay-Z illustrates the application of a business mind in music industry. He secured the No. 2 spot on the latest </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> annual “Forbes Five” list of the richest figures in hip hop with an estimated net worth of $810 million. Last year, Sprint invested $200 million in his music streaming service, Tidal, which put the company’s worth at six times what he initially paid for it. Across the breadth of his career, the artist has demonstrated a fiscally successful approach to nearly everything he touches. This success, in conjunction with his musical catalog, is largely the reason why the artist is so influential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the lens of the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one can observe a distinct change of style in the rapper’s product packaging. The album’s rollout wasn’t long or elaborate, contrary to many of his contemporaries’ releases (Kanye West, Drake, etc.), and its role on Tidal is quite peculiar. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tidal, Jay-Z released a collection of “short films” with the album, some of which are videos for particular tracks, while others are footnotes for those music videos which essentially contextualize their content. These films are somewhat abstract; interrupting the music in the video of “4:44” are obscure viral videos and clips that appear to be from Worldstar Hip Hop. An interpretive dance can be seen at the end of the video, perhaps depicting his and Beyonce’s relationship. In the footnotes of “The Story of OJ” and “4:44,” prominent media figures like Will Smith and Kendrick Lamar express their thoughts on race and their attitudes towards women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation and packaging of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is relatively new to the rap scene. Jay-Z takes an unorthodox approach, making it an absolute pain in the ass for you to listen to his music. In order to even stream the album, you must either a) subscribe to Tidal, as his discography has been removed from all other platforms, or b) navigate a labyrinth of online tutorials that lead to free, temporary access to the streaming service. To clarify: this pain isn’t necessarily a bad thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of these short films and additional elements of the album (e.g., Jay-Z’s daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, laying a verse on physical copies of the album), Jay-Z provides an interactive, intimate perspective into his own life. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is far more personal than the bulk of his past work, opening up about his infidelity and thoughts on racial inequality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Kanye West, a semi-estranged affiliate of Jay-Z’s and a business enigma in himself. The release of his last record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Life of Pablo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was one of the strangest musical occurrences of 2016. The album title erratically shifted multiple times. Analogously, the content of the album itself wasn’t static either, something completely antithetical to the nature of commercial music. That is, West released multiple updated versions of the album, framing it as a “living, evolving art project.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can additionally look to artists like Frank Ocean, who also exhibited one of the oddest album rollouts of the year. After enduring a tumultuous relationship with Def Jam Recordings and releasing the visual album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endless</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to satisfy contractual agreements with the label, Ocean released his album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a four year manifestation of the artist’s creative endeavors. Moreover, the record didn’t just come to fruition in an exclusively sonic form. Like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endless</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which paired an album with minimalistic visual production, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was accompanied with an $80 visual compilation of mixed media: a magazine entitled “Boys Don’t Cry,” the name of his current personal music label. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artists like West and Ocean have illustrated something that Jay-Z is doing right now, something that has become increasingly popular among artists, particularly rap artists today. That is, these creators are moving beyond status quo and crafting interactive, elaborate works of art that deviate from conventional boundaries of music. Artists are becoming more creative with the way in which they promote and present their music. This isn’t something that was nonexistent prior to the work of contemporary rap artists, but rap is one of the most rapidly expanding genres of music. Its popularity has sprawled beyond the confines of its initial conception. Today’s hip-hop leaders are presented with the opportunity to redefine what we see as an album experience, shaping it in a more creative, interactive direction.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a2dfe89bd1991b8b81b117b7ed43ac0?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/williamemmons/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">William Emmons</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Will is an Artsweek Editor.
