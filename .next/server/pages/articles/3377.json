Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was founded by Kavitta Ghai ‘19 and Jordan Long, a third-year environmental science major who took a year off to launch the start-up to provide UCSB students with an alternative to Slack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack is an instant messaging platform generally used by large organizations for communication on the business level. Nectir, on the other hand, is a system based entirely on improving communication at the academic level between students and instructors. Nectir is actively being built into the GauchoSpace program as an add-on, giving teachers and students the option to use it in their class as a tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ghai, Slack is “a communication platform that’s made for enterprise,” meaning it is structured to support business at a corporate level, whereas the two envisioned Nectir as a structure for communication in an academic environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While the idea of Slack is great, there are a lot of problems that make it unusable at schools. They don’t have data privacy for students … [and] it’s insanely expensive,” Ghai noted, adding that there are “a lot of technical problems” with Slack.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Ghai and Long spent two years developing an alternative: Nectir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last two years, the team has met with university administrators, professors, teaching assistants and students. The purpose of these meetings was to understand what problems these people are seeing and facing every day on campus at a communicative level — allowing the team to create real solutions to real problems, Ghai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the first classes at UCSB to use the Nectir program was a workshop class in the Instructional Development department led by one of their instructional consultants, Mindy Colin. By adapting her class to the program, Ghai and Long were given the opportunity to see how Nectir would function in reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was designed specifically to create lines of communication throughout an entire school, not just for one class or within one major. In order for students to use the program, professors must create a channel for their class — similar to those in Slack — that will be embedded in their class GauchoSpace site. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program had its soft launch in Fall Quarter 2019 and since then, Ghai and Long said that 15% of the people at UCSB have used or currently have access to a Nectir channel for a specific class. It is working so well that, according to Ghai, the team is in the process of signing a contract with the school for funding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s goal is that “every single student on campus should have Nectir regardless of whether their TA or professor decides to use it,” Ghai said, by Spring Quarter 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose behind Nectir is to solve this “position of frustration” that students feel when they transition from a 30-person class in high school to a 500-person college course, Long explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes days to figure out things, and you’re often alone in the library banging your head against the wall trying to figure something out,” Long said. “We don’t know how to fix it, we don’t know how to create a new educational system… but what we can do is use technology to connect people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghai added that a bonus of the program is that it was created by students for students, as opposed to being created by tech companies who create academic tools without factoring in student perspectives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actual set-up of the Nectir program was designed in-house; Long manages all of the technical parts in-house and runs the servers himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long and Gh</span>ai have been able to manage a huge portion of the work by bringing their ideas to life themselves, allowing them to move very quickly through the developing process while not needing a significant amount of start-up money.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we’re starting to reach out to other schools, it will eventually be time to bring other people onto the team, but for right now, for everything we have done at UCSB, it has worked really well with just the two of us,” Ghai added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team plans to first completely integrate the system at UCSB before branching out and attempting to spread the program to other schools, such as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and other UC campuses.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [2/03/2020, 7:49 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jordan Long is a second-year student.

The obvious one, to those native to the crescent city and even to those who aren’t, is the day Hurricane Katrina struck the city on Aug. 23, 2005, and completely destroyed people’s homes, families, livelihoods, and hope.</p>\n<p>Due to the devastating hit the city took from Katrina, about 9,000 people took shelter in the New Orleans Superdome, home to the Saints, who had evacuated beforehand. A place once home to one of the worst franchises in all of sports now became home to people who had been through one of the worst catastrophes imaginable. Even worse, the lack of supplies was so bad many people were left starving and thirsty.</p>\n<p>The state of the Superdome became extremely bad over the next few days due to the breakdown of hygiene, urinals, and plumbing, which left the smell inside the stadium horrible. The outside also went bad as the roof was peeling off and holes were starting to form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Due to the state of the Superdome and the severity of the situation, the 2005 Saints played no home games in the dome and played in Baton Rouge Stadium or the Alamodome. Worst of all, their home opener was rescheduled to a Monday night “home” game against the Giants at The Meadowlands, home of the New York Giants. That’s right: The Saints’ “home opener” was scheduled to be played at their opponents’ home stadium, and there was nothing they could do about it.</p>\n<p>As the 2005 season went on there were various reports that the owner, Tom Benson, and government officials in San Antonio were working behind the scenes concerning a possible permanent relocation for the Saints to San Antonio. The reports said Benson would get out of his contract by saying the Superdome was no longer adequate to house his team.</p>\n<p>Fans were stunned. By this point they were just trying to get back into a normal lifestyle, and now the team they loved was being taken away from them. Make no mistake; although the Saints were a terrible team for many, many years, they were still loved by the city of New Orleans.</p>\n<p>Many fans in Louisiana were angered and felt people in San Antonio were taking advantage of an already desolated city by stealing their franchise. Tensions ran so high that the New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin called Benson’s actions shameful to those who supported the team through about 40 losing seasons.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, once all was said and done, the NFL stated that the Saints would stay in New Orleans and the Superdome would re-open its doors on Sept. 25, 2006, for a Monday night game against the Falcons. Fans were so happy to hear the Saints were staying, that for the first time in franchise history the team sold its entire home schedule to season ticket holders.</p>\n<p>That’s where our second day comes in. The day most embedded into New Orleans culture, whether you are a sports fan or not. The day the crescent city was reborn.</p>\n<p>Very rarely will there be another play that touches the hearts of people not even part of the sports world as much as the blocked punt by Steve Gleason, which was returned for a touchdown after a Falcons three-and-out on their opening drive, now dubbed “Rebirth.” To this day, people swear the Superdome was never as loud as during and after that magical play.</p>\n<p>Those who doubt the importance of one play, especially one such as this, truly do not know the electricity that flowed through the city and their football team thanks to Rebirth. The Saints crushed the Falcons 23-3 that night and went on to have their best season in franchise history, finishing 10-6, clinching a first round bye and reaching their first ever NFC championship game.</p>\n<p>While the Saints’ season in 2006 did not end with a Super Bowl championship, the pieces were set to make a run and eventually win the most coveted game. By comparison, New Orleans as a city was also recovering steadily, but it wasn’t ready to say it was fully back to normal only one year after such a horrible tragedy.</p>\n<p>See, the thing about the Saints and their ties with their city is that as the football team started to become a winner, the crescent city was recovering. It was almost as though the city was lifted through the success of the Saints, which all came to fruition in 2009 when New Orleans was able to see their once loveable losers become champions of the football world.</p>\n<p>Rebirth wasn’t just about a single play in which an athlete made a solid effort. It was not about the players, it was not about the football team and it certainly was not about the touchdown.</p>\n<p>It was about the city coming together and putting its love into a team that was never respected. It was about the beginning of the reshaping that took place as the city moved on from Katrina and the Saints moved on from their horrible past. Both parties were ready to become winners, and now they are.</p>\n<p>When the Saints and Falcons re-took the field 10 years later this past Monday to celebrate the historic event, it really felt like everything had come full circle. Sure, the Saints are not a top team anymore, and, unfortunately, they did lose this past Monday 45-32, but the journey from that night and blocked punt in 2006 until now was truly a spectacle worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>Katrina was one of the worst things that could happen to any city anywhere in the world. It robbed people of many valuable things. But what the Saints and the citizens of New Orleans were able to embody is the ultimate form of resiliency. That’s what makes Rebirth not only special, but certainly worthy of the title given to that blocked punt on that night and worthy of the statue made in its honor.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

It’s all done. The cash is in the bank.”</p>\n<p>According to Munger, the donation would serve to provide a place for physicists from around the world to convene on campus.</p>\n<p>“This donation is to provide a residence for these most important physicists in the world that come to UCSB all the time to these conferences where they interchange ideas about physics and so on, and helping that program which I greatly admire,” Munger said.</p>\n<p>According to Munger, creating a space for world-class physicists to meet and conduct research is imperative to scientific progress.</p>\n<p>“These programs where visiting physicists get together are a very old thing in the world,” Munger said. “Remember Einstein and Madam Curie and all those people? [They] used to meet in Belgium in the twenties. It has always been important that these great physicists get together.”</p>\n<p>Munger also said the university is the best possible place to host top-notch scientists.</p>\n<p>“The achievements of UCSB are so great, that now the one place where they all come is UCSB,” Munger said. “It’s by far the most important gathering place for the best physicists in the world, they’re there all the time, they have program after program all year long.”</p>\n<p>According to Munger, his donation toward scientific progress will help bolster what he views as a suffering nationwide public school system.</p>\n<p>“I regret that the public school system, which was pretty good when I was young, has had such enormous deterioration in our central cities. Some of the most brilliant minds in the country have tried to fix that and have had great trouble with it,” Munger said. “That’s why I give to visiting physicists. I know that will work.”</p>\n<p>Charles Munger III, Munger’s grandson and UCSB alumnus, said his grandfather has been involved with the university for several years.</p>\n<p>“He actually gave a talk back in 2007 or 2006 before I applied to UCSB and I’ve been going up and hanging out in Santa Barbara for quite a while,” Munger III said.</p>\n<p>According to Munger, his grandson’s attendance was not his sole reason for donating.</p>\n<p>“I am very grateful for the great education that my grandson had, but I gave them the money because I so admire the program that brings all these visiting physicists to UCSB,” Munger said. “It’s the most important program of that kind in the world, and number two is not close.”</p>\n<p>With regards to his grandfather, Munger III said that his affiliation with Munger’s reputation is “an honor.”</p>\n<p>“He’s known for having high integrity, for being really honest and honorable, not really for screwing anyone over,” Munger III said. “It does make it a lot easier. When people say ‘Charles Munger,’ it’s never anything bad. It’s always like ‘What a fantastic person.’”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers and organizers spoke out against some of the Indian government’s practices, such as the lockdown of the region of Kashmir, the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and violence against people protesting these acts, actions which they deemed representative of “state-sponsored facism,” according to the event’s Facebook page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event drew over 100 attendees and featured chants led by graduate student and organizer Pratik Raghu</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speeches from students and faculty members, a recitation of a revolutionary Urdu poem by organizer and first-year graduate student Tannishtha Bhattacharjee and a strategizing session to discuss ways in which people can support the protests in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was organized by Raghu, Bhattacharjee, third-year English graduate student Somak Mukherjee, graduate student Surojit Kayal and first-year film and media studies graduate student Pujita, who asked to be referred to by her first name due to privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the teach-in, third-year College of Creative Studies biology major and speaker Salman Sadakkadulla from the UCSB Muslim Student Association criticized the process required to prove citizenship under the NRC, which declared 1.9 million applicants from the northeastern state of Assam </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> many of whom are Muslims and Bengali Hindus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to be stateless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Imagine waking up tomorrow, in I.V.,” Sadakkadulla said. “Imagine waking up without carrying your wallet. Imagine being stopped by [the] I.V. Foot Patrol and being asked to show your birth certificate. You don’t have that? Well, do you have your Social Security card? No? Well, if you don’t have that, do you have your driver’s license? No, you forgot it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants also handed out informational documents, stating that the CAA, which passed in December 2019, “when combined with the NRC, could lead to Indian Muslims, transgender people, adivasis, poor people, dalits, women, those not having land — everyone without documents — being declared stateless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CAA provides a path to citizenship for undocumented Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian refugees escaping religious persecution in countries neighboring India. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opponents to the act argue that it does not give eligibility to Muslims nor religious minorities from all countries that neighbor India, such as Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Christian Tamils from Sri Lanka, according to the Economic Times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pujita, the initial organizer for the teach-in, said in an interview that detention centers built for stateless people in Assam share similarities with migrant detention centers in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The United States of America and Trump and Modi are constantly built on their politics of illegal immigration,” Pujita said. “Words like ‘border patrol,’ ‘detention camps,’ ‘the wall’ — these words that move around here are similar concepts and similar words that are being mobilized [in India] as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the chants from the teach-in elaborated on that comparison: “From Assam to El Paso, detention camps have got to go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pujita was initially mobilized to put on the teach-in after the attacks on </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University,_Delhi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (JNU) in New Delhi on Jan. 5, in which 50 masked people, later identified as members of the right-wing Hindu Raksha Dal, beat students and faculty with iron rods and acid bottles, vandalizing property and “specifically targeting Muslim and Kashmiri students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It was] an act of unprecedented terror that happened on campus,” Pujita said. “I spent six years there and all my political upbringing has been [from there], and I endow all my life and existence to that campus. So that was at once feeling helpless, being away, but also wanting to do things here and tell people what’s going on back home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers from the teach-in drew parallels between the situation in India and authoritarianism across the world. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92462\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"165692605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92485\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92462\" data-attachment-id=\"92462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/graduate-students-hold-teach-in-at-storke-tower-to-protest-indian-prime-minister-modis-administration/india-protest_kaiyi-yang_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"India Protest_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-92462\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/India-Protest_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teach-in at UCSB was an urgent call-to-action for people to care about “these oppressed millions who have taken to the streets” in India. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year English major Rachel Andrews, a student speaker from UCSB’s Students for Justice in Palestine, compared the military occupation of the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir  to the occupation of Palestine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kashmir is considered the most militarized zone in the world. Excessive force is used by the army, even on children, and there are extreme restrictions,” Andrews said. “For example, Kashmir has a curfew, and in a similar way, Palestinians are not able to move freely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article 370, which granted semi-autonomous status to Kashmir and Jammu, a Hindu-majority state, was revoked in August 2019, subjecting the two states to greater Indian influence and control. Following the revocation, the Indian government stationed tens of thousands of troops in Kashmir, suspended telecommunications and banned public movements, according to CNBC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year global studies and philosophy major Alia Reynolds, another student speaker from UCSB’s Students for Justice in Palestine, warned that the same pattern of “danger, hatred and persecution” will continue to spread across the world and the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do not engage in the advocacy, policy, prevention, restructurement and revolution that is available to us now, we will fall into the same pattern,” Reynolds stressed. “If we do not fight for the rights and lives of those around the world who are currently being denied those rights or tortured or killed for fighting for them, who will fight for us when our time comes?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers expressed hope through the multidimensional student movement emerging out of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s exertion of authoritarian power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bishnupriya Ghosh, chair of the global studies department, expressed hope for the college students across India that have been launching protests at their universities, most recently after the passage of the CAA in December, and fighting to reestablish India as a secular, democratic republic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the attacks on the universities have continued, [at] many universities, there’s been a broad coalition, visibly between Muslims, between Dalits [and] between women and students,” Ghosh said in her speech. “It’s a coalition which is extraordinary because it goes across ethnic and linguistic grounds, religious borders, castes and generations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Raghu, the teach-in at UCSB was an urgent call-to-action for people to care about “these oppressed millions who have taken to the streets” in India. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve felt a keen sense of desperation over the past few weeks … over the past few years, really, as authoritarianism has gained momentum in India,” Raghu said. “And I’ve tried to use that sense of desperation to bring others into the struggle.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
