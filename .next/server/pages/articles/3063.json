Soriano said he plans to mount a giant projector screen right over San Miguel stage, which would cost around $7,000. According to Soriano, the project is relatively inexpensive and will pay for itself in less than three uses.</p>\n<p>Even though a mural is slated to be painted on the wall where the projector screen will be mounted, Soriano explained the screen would not get in the way of students’ ability to enjoy the mural as it could be easily rolled up and stored. Soriano said the screen would be available for use for any student in the residence halls who can provide their own projector and extension cable.</p>\n<p>“All the buildings have their own projector set and an extension cord,” Soriano said. “Bringing the projector just beyond the stage is good enough to have a reasonably sized image.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Collegiate Senator for the College of Engineering Amir Khazaieli discussed the current status of the A.S. annex in I.V. and upcoming plans for its use. The ad hoc committee dedicated to the annex, of which Khazaieli is chair, has been overseeing the development of the space for the past three years. Although the funding for the annex comes from funds that are paid by all students, the annex will only be available to A.S. groups that make appointments beforehand.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders — such as A.S. committees — and student fees currently cover the cost of leasing space.</p>\n<p>“It’s easier to arrange through an A.S. group, but all students are allowed and encouraged to use the space as well,” Khazaieli said. “Student fees are already being used to pay the lease. Every student is technically a stakeholder in the space and we are really trying to respect that.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said A.S. groups will hold a survey over the next two weeks to get a better idea of what the community wants from the space.</p>\n<p>Additionally at the meeting, member of A.S. Community Financial Fund Jose Raygoza spoke about different grants and supplemental loans available to students. Last year, according to Raygoza, $82,330 was given out and divided into 227 grants. Raygoza said he has noticed a trend that indicates that grants are more in demand, meaning that it will become more difficult for students to receive any.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has an equal chance to apply, but applicants are chosen on a first-come, first-serve basis,” Raygoza said.</p>\n<p>Raygoza said CFF is looking into ways of finding more money for grants. Senators also discussed adding additional tables to the dining commons, the ongoing process of adding a Gender and Sexuality General Education requirement and logistics surrounding the hydration stations that will be set up during Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-01/a-s-senate-discusses-projector-installation-new-annex-community-financial-fund/","id":3063,"author":{"id":193,"name":"Elliott Wright"},"related":[3062,3061,3060],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":193,"name":"Elliott Wright","biography":"Not available","articles":[3063,3068],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

The resolution was first introduced during last week’s meeting and then tabled until yesterday.</p>\n<p>The resolutions’ demands for Napolitano included holding mandatory trainings for UCPD on the rights of undocumented students’ and other underrepresented groups, having UC staff training on the issues that undocumented students experience and supporting the Trust Act, which Governor Jerry Brown recently signed into law.</p>\n<p>Several audience members who spoke at Public Forum had also attended last week’s meeting and reiterated their reasons for supporting the resolution. Anisha Ahuja and Katlen Abu Ata issued a prepared statement on behalf of A.S. Human Rights Board, emphasizing the confusing process by which Napolitano was elected and the threat they believe she poses to members of the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“We, the UC Santa Barbara Human Rights Board, stand in solidarity with communities that have been attacked and further marginalized under the leadership of Napolitano during her term as Secretary of Homeland Security,” Ahuja and Abu Ata stated. “We aim to create a safe space and advocate for all students, regardless of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientation and classes. We work to pressure the University to uphold these standards and qualities of fair and equal treatment.”</p>\n<p>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS said passing the resolution would show solidarity with other UC campuses that have already passed similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“Passing a vote of ‘no confidence’ — it has so much weight in terms of being in solidarity with other Campuses and being able to say UC Santa Barbara will have no confidence with you because of your history,” Campos said. “These concerns are valid. I don’t know how else to convince you all.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Norma Orozco said the resolution presented a critical opportunity for the senate to take a definitive stand on a pressing issue.<br>\n“At UCSB I’ve seen a lot of student politicians, and A.S. is supposed to be a place for everyone. It’s supposed to be a place that creates student leaders. I really want you all to take this idea really to mind, to heart…as a leader,” Orozco said.</p>\n<p>Following public forum and administrative tasks, senators debated the resolution themselves. Off-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield said that public forum showed how little opposition there was to the resolution, and that he could not see clear negative consequences to it.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have students saying that they oppose this resolution coming to the senate,” Wakefield said. “Voting yes on this would not be negative. No students are going to be suffering if we say yes.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Off-Campus Senator Jimmy Villarreal said he did not feel the demands outlined in the resolution directly applied to Napolitano’s role as UC President.</p>\n<p>“The most important part should be the demands that were made,” Villarreal said. “I don’t feel that the demands actually fall under Napolitano’s job description.”</p>\n<p>Senator Amir Khazaieli said he doubted the bill would yield tangible results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like this bill for one main reason, not because of the ‘no confidence’ clause but mainly because it fails to introduce tangible results that will change our campus for the better,” Khazaieli said. “Let’s make some directives and let’s add it to the resolution.”</p>\n<p>Other senators took issue with the “aggressive” language of the bill, such as Off-Campus Senator Jake Orens, who felt that Napolitano should be given a chance to act as president before being attacked.</p>\n<p>“I think she has a chance and I think the bill can be revised…but I just don’t feel comfortable with how aggressive it is,” Orens said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus said the aggressive tone is actually a point in favor of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think being aggressive is necessarily a bad thing,” Theus said. “I have seen so many things come out of the senate office…because of decisions that were aggressive but that needed to happen…A lot of things aren’t ever going to change in the world if you’re not being aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Beatrice Contreras, who authored the resolution, urged the senators to move to a vote and let their vote speak for them. After the vote, Contreras said the decision could set a dangerous precedent for the Senate.</p>\n<p>“I feel like from now on, [members of the communities affected by the resolution] are going to be very hesitant about approaching us, they’re going to be very hesitant about asking us anything, hesitant about us representing them,” Contreras said. “We have to earn their trust and their respect back.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/","id":3060,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3059,3058,3057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Now her track record is making many students question her ability to prioritize the needs of undocumented UC students, and various students groups — such as Human Rights Board, the Black Student Union and UCSB Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (a coalition of undocumented students) — all formally denounced her appointment at yesterday’s Senate meeting.</div>\n<div>Napolitano was appointed by the UC Regents to replace Mark Yudof as UC President in July, with all but Student Regent Cinthia Flores voting in favor of her appointment.</div>\n<div>At Public Forum, students and other community members voiced support for a unified resolution called “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Students and Immigrant Communities,” which presents several demands to recently appointed Napolitano. The Resolution concludes by stating that, if passed, the Senate expresses “no confidence” in Napolitano’s ability to perform as UC President. However, as of press time, Senate decided to not vote on the issue and wait until next week to reach a final decision.</div>\n<div>Katlen Abuata of Human Rights Board was the first to approach the A.S. Senate with her support of the resolution, and Abuata said Napolitano’s appointment jeopardizes the safety of certain minority communities on campus.</div>\n<div>“You all are here and you have the extreme privilege of representing a diverse group of students; some of these students are undocumented,” Abuata said. “Some of these students have a fear of having a leader of their UC system being someone that deported hundreds of thousands of people.”</div>\n<div>Second-year Mohsin Mirza, who also came on behalf of HRB, said the process by which Napolitano was selected does not reflect the interests of the general UC student population.</div>\n<div>“I think we need to highlight the fact that her appointment in the first place was completely undemocratic,” Mirza said. “None of [the potential candidates] have any experience with education … As student leaders here, you’re asked to represent the students … I don’t see a group here saying ‘We love Napolitano. We want her to be here.’”</div>\n<div>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS provided a personal testimony of her experience as an undocumented student, explaining why she felt Napolitano was a detrimental influence to the UC system.</div>\n<div>“I am an undocumented student. I was at that meeting yesterday with Napolitano,” Campos said.  “I can’t say how I felt … to have someone that has caused so much damage to our community — not only students who are undocumented, but students who aren’t undocumented who have parents [who] are undocumented … I don’t know if you can understand what that feels like to have her as our new UC president.”</div>\n<div>Liam Stanton, another student at Public Forum, provided another perspective on the resolution. While Stanton said he disagreed with Napolitano’s appointment, he urged Senators to move forward through open negotiations, rather than a vote of no confidence.</div>\n<div>“The reality of it is that now she is the president of the UC system,” Stanton said. “I don’t believe that an utter show of no confidence gets us anywhere.”</div>\n<div>Fourth-year Norma Orozco also came to Public Forum to stress the negative impact of Napolitano’s appointment on undocumented students at UCSB, saying that UCSB should value their undocumented community.</div>\n<div>“This year, in fact, we have the largest amount of undocumented population at UCSB, and it’s something to be proud of,” Orozco said. “It is our duty, our responsibility, and it is our right to tell her that we have no confidence in her.”</div>\n<div>Chancellor Henry T. Yang also spoke at the meeting, assuring the student body that he would be available for any necessary support. Additionally, Off-Campus Senator Jake Speyer announced he would be transferring schools after Fall Quarter, and therefore resigning from his senatorial position, which means the candidate who received the next most votes during last spring’s elections will be offered the position.</div>\n<div>The executive officers presented their first reports for the coming school year, announcing what projects would be released from their respective offices. These include renovations to the UCen, a student-led classes initiative, a waitlist system to be implemented on UCSB GOLD and a visit by President Napolitano to the campus in November, at which students will be able to directly address her with concerns.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>This article appeared on page 4 of Thursday October 3, 2013′s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">[CORRECTION: The print version of this article was incorrectly titled, “A.S.

Moore reported the idea of temporary fencing he hoped to install along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive to prevent cliff fall injuries or deaths was shut down due to funding issues as well as liability concerns, from the University’s Office of Risk Management.</p>\n<p>Moore said he was frustrated with the decision but is determined to continue working on the issue, as he remains confident in achieving future success.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be moving forward to negotiate with the county on some sort of framework or method, so that this doesn’t happen again [and] so that we can always have temporary fencing during high-risk events,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>He also mentioned the Festival ordinance that will be in effect from this Saturday until Nov. 4, saying he and other groups are working to make students aware of the ordinance and other changes. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure folks don’t get an unnecessary ticket,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Moore said hydration stations and portable bathrooms will be set up for each night of Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, executive officers and public forum speakers delivered reports on their recent accomplishments and upcoming activities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud discussed his recent meeting with new U.C. President Napolitano in Oakland on Monday during his report, in which he expressed positive results that included promises from her to meet with the elected members of campus governments in person once a quarter and to speak to them on the phone once per month.</p>\n<p>In addition, Abboud said he was pleased with their success in getting Napolitano to address the skyrocketing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>“She did well, in terms of answering what we wanted but we did corner her on a couple of things we wanted … like Prop 13,” Abboud said. “So we got her to admit that Prop 13 is one of the reasons tuition has gotten so high.”</p>\n<p>Along with the passing of a few minor bills, the meeting tabled a bill sending directives to Napolitano. Towards the end of the meeting, Senators debated the bill, concluding they would clarify the language and demands of the drafted proposal and vote on it next week.</p>\n<p>One section of the bill prohibits the use of U.C. funds to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to Senator Nikki Calderon, currently no U.C. funds go toward assisting ICE, but the bill ensures that these funds will not be used in the future. This section Calderon said, serves to secure that the funding “may not be happening, but it will not happen also.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a tree-planting event Saturday at Goleta Valley Beautiful, planned homeless assistance in I.V. provided by Pescadero Lofts and efforts to make the dining commons Kosher-friendly. For next week’s meeting, Senate members will come dressed in their Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This story is a </em>Daily Nexus<em> online exclusive.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/associated-students-senate-discusses-halloween-new-uc-president/","id":3062,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3061,3060,3059],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
