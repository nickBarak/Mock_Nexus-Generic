CSD to hold its own election in an odd-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district would still spend some money in the 2020 election but would not spend nearly as much as they would holding their own election. Abboud cited the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 2018 Measure R election</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in which the district paid $11,000, as an example of cost-saving during an even-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The research is conclusive that even-year elections allow public agencies to spend fewer tax dollars conducting elections, and foster more democratic participation,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the county calculated the savings estimate by tallying the number of registered voters in I.V. and applying a cost of approximately $1.50 to each one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three positions on the board of directors will now be up for grabs in the 2020 general election, as opposed to fall 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those positions are currently held by Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Director Ethan Bertrand and Director Kristie Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen’s and Hedges’s seats will also be extended from two-year terms to four-year terms in the 2020 election, per Government Code section </span><a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-61250.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61250(e)(1)(A)(i)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seat currently held by Bertrand will continue to be a two-year term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt and Director Jay Freeman, who originally ran for four-year terms, will have their terms extended from Dec. 2021 to Dec. 2022. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

</span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/assemblywoman_monique_limon_announces_candidacy_for_state_senate_20190921\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced this past

As assemblymember, Limón represents parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and has drafted up a number of California bills related to coastal resources, childcare and women’s issues, among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 27, Abboud is by far the youngest candidate to announce his candidacy for the seat so far. He began his political career as UC Santa Barbara’s Residential Housing Association (RHA) President during the 2012-2013 school year and the Associated Students (A.S.) </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/abboud-named-a-s-president-for-2013-14-as-opp-sweeps-elections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">during the 2013-2014 school year. He graduated from UCSB in 2014 with a degree in political science and completed a master’s degree in technology management in 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a long-term I.V. resident who has been in the college town since 2010, Abboud’s roots extend beyond the university; he was integral to the campaign that created Isla Vista’s first local government and secured funding for Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and has served as the government’s general manager since Nov. 2017. He also currently serves as a member of the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees and has held the position since 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an interview that for the past five years, he’s been “working on strengthening democracy in my town,” referencing his work on the Measures E, F and R campaigns to create and fund the I.V. CSD respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot in the past nine years to contribute to the community and learn about state issues and engage with issues that affect the local and state level,” he said. “I want to take what I’ve learned of how democracy can be different here to the state level and take our values to apply to the whole state.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But his latest venture to the statewide level was brought on by “imminent issues” affecting all Californians, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He cited “continued divestment in education,” “climate change” and “strengthening our democracy” as reasons for why he has decided to enter the race now. He added that he is the “only candidate in the race right now who has experience in the education sector.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud did not list any concrete points he would tackle if elected, and declined to further elaborate on his platform, stating he is “getting [his] campaign organization together.” He also declined to name his campaign managers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My philosophy as a candidate is that we all prosper only when everyone prospers,” he said. “There’s a lot of work we need to do about strengthening our democracy and making sure people can fully participate.” </span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-88036\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grange (pictured above at the opening of the Edible Garden Project) will be serving on the board until November 2020. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange, an environmental studies major, will be joining Carlos Lopez, Pegeen Soutar and Sarah Bernard on the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange’s term will span from May 2019 to November 2020, filling in for the remainder of former Director Lebell’s term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He filled one of two open seats on the board; the second spot is up for grabs following Director Celine Washington’s decision to leave the board, announced by Lopez during the same meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, Bernard said she has confidence in Grange’s capability, especially with the projects he can bring to the board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I see a lot of potential with Whit, with a lot of projects that include the community garden, including all different types of groups from the community,” Bernard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange first learned about the opening through his work developing the </span><a href=\"http://www.islavistamethodist.com/edible-garden-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community garden</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the University United Methodist Church on the corner of Camino del Sur and Sueño Road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange said his previous work in I.V. has familiarized himself with the area and invested in him a significance for I.V. parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of college students don’t really see I.V. as much of a community at all, but the parks are a space where people can come together and neighbors can meet each other,” Grange said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a new director, Grange said he wants to focus on local community-based projects. Grange said community gardens, local government and being a part of the community are what he enjoys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange hopes to learn more about the process of achieving projects in the community and “seeing how that project culminates and how funding is pulled together and how staff works with board members, works with the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone has an idea for a project in their community or if someone has some sort of vision they want to accomplish, the process for something like that, start to finish, is really cool,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just how all these different things come together because there’s so many parts in play, it’s almost mind boggling.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange plans to work on several projects, including the expansion of Estero Gardens and the development of the new community center set to open in August.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Grange hopes to see more students come out and interact with some of the more permanent residents in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most students view I.V. as a transitory place. Something you hear a lot with graduating people is like, ‘Oh yeah I’m over I.V.’ or whatever. People just have a certain idea over what the culture is in I.V. and don’t really try to explore beyond that,” Grange said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be cool to see people just meeting more of their neighbors and walking around with their headphones in less often.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
