But perhaps the most compelling was the return of sophomore guard John Green playing in his first ever regular season game as a Gaucho despite this being his third year in the program.</p>\n<p>Green, who missed the past two seasons and the beginning of this year with broken foot bones, entered the game Saturday against UC Davis to a standing ovation from the crowd, logging his first meaningful minutes in a Gaucho uniform.</p>\n<p>“Emotionally, I get choked up. You’re talking about a kid that has waited three years to play in a regular season game and had four broken bones, and a kid that wants it as bad as anybody we have in the program,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “No one, and I’ve been here 16 years, no one has endured what he’s endured.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Immediately after entering, Green grabbed a rebound and put it right back up for a basket en route to a two-point, three-rebound performance over seven minutes.</p>\n<p>The other headline Saturday in the Gauchos’ 82-67 victory over Davis was Big Al’s 27-point, 20-rebound performance, marking the first 20-20 game in UCSB history since 1990. Williams was a big reason Santa Barbara moved into first place with a 14-6 overall record and 5-2 mark in the Big West. Davis now stands at 7-15 overall and 2-5 in the conference.</p>\n<p>“I love the fact that he got 20 and 20. It says something about a guy if he can go get 20 and 20 in a game,” Coach Williams said. “That doesn’t happen very often. He’s already getting a lot of national attention but you get 20 and 20, that’s a feat.”</p>\n<p>Williams finished the first half with 10 points and 12 rebounds and followed that up with a 17-point, eight rebound performance in the second half. Big Al also finished the game with four assists and two blocked shots.</p>\n<p>“We go to him every game to see who can stop him because I don’t think anyone in division I basketball can stop him,” freshman point guard Eric Childress said.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 15 points on 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc, becoming only the third Gaucho to make 200 career three-pointers in the process.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 11 points for UCSB, while Childress added eight points and three assists. This game was never in question as the Gauchos outrebounded Davis by a margin of 14 and outshot the Aggies in both field goal and three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that we can run this conference and really be the number one team to win that Big West Championship,” Green said. “Once we have the opportunity to meet these two teams that we lost to [we’re confident] that we’re going to handle business.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest against UC Irvine began the weekend on a high note for the Gauchos, as they stomped the Anteaters in an 80-60 victory. Big Al led UCSB with 26 points and 10 rebounds despite having to go against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye who is all of 7’6” and 290 pounds.</p>\n<p>“We really came out very intense, excited to play and we definitely showed some stuff tonight,” Big Al said. “We showed our heart, we showed our aggressiveness and we showed our competitive edge out there. When we have that competitive edge and we play as hard as we did tonight we’re a tough team to beat.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taran Brown finished the game with 16 points and shot a perfect 5-5 from the three. Boswell scored 10 points off the bench, sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added eight points and six rebounds and junior point guard Zalmico Harmon contributed seven points and six assists.</p>\n<p>Following a Saturday victory at Cal Poly, Irvine now stands tied with UCSB for first with a 5-2 Big West record (14-9 overall).</p>\n<p>“We have guys that have really accepted their roles on this team and I think that we’re finally starting to see how good we can possibly be,” Big Al said. “Of course we have a lot of work to do, but when we all accept our roles and play our roles we’re a tough team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays Thursday at Hawai’i.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos will attempt to rebound from the loss when they return home, where they are 5-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>Irvine, meanwhile, had a six-game winning streak snapped when they fell to Hawaii on Saturday for its first and only conference loss so far this season.</p>\n<p>An interesting matchup to watch in this game will be UCSB junior center Alan Williams against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye. The 6’7” Williams ranks first in the Big West with 22.9 points and 10.6 rebounds, and is second in blocks at 2.4 per game. Ndiaye, however, is an imposing 7’6”, the tallest player in the nation, and leads the conference with 3.4 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>It will certainly be interesting to see how much of a defensive impact Ndiaye will have on Big Al, the seventh leading scorer in the nation.</p>\n<p>“Al will be fine against him. Al will be able to score. [Ndiaye] really affects the game, he’s huge. We’ve never played against anything like him, nobody has,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “At the same time he scores nine points a game. His biggest effect on the game is on the defensive end, he’s tremendously effective down there at taking away the rim. Al might have to hit jumpers but I think Al will find ways to be productive.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Anteaters are dangerous and versatile, ranking second in the conference averaging over 75 points per game. Senior guard Chris McNealy leads Irvine with over 12 points per game, while junior forward Will Davis II and freshman guard Luke Nelson each average just above 11 per game. Ndiaye along with sophomore guard Alex Young score above nine points per game to give the Anteaters a reliable starting five.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounds pulling down nearly 40 boards per game, while placing atop the Big West with a 48.5 field goal percentage. Ndiaye and Davis II each average just above six rebounds per game to lead the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good rebounding team, they have a plus-six average on the year rebounding-wise, which is a big number in college basketball. And that is not just Mamadou,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly will not go down without a fight, especially in front of a home crowd that has come out to support in recent games. In the last two home games, the attendance at the Thunderdome has averaged more than 4,500 fans per game.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can make this place really tough for opponents to come into. That’s our main goal: to get as many students out here as we possibly can,” Big Al said. “Every game is important when you get into conference, especially home games. You’ve got to win as many home games as you possibly can, and this one’s really important, so we’ve got to get it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the key number for the Gauchos seems to be 70. UCSB is 11-0 when they allow 70 points of fewer and 1-6 when allowing 70 or more. In order to defeat first-place Irvine, Santa Barbara will need to keep Irvine’s numerous offensive weapons in check.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will respond to Irvine with a trio of wing players who have supported Big Al from the perimeter. Brown along with sophomore guard Michael Bryson and senior guard Kyle Boswell have been impressive from three-point land this season, with the latter two each ranking in the top six in three-point percentage in the Big West. Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has helped facilitate the scoring with a conference best 5.2 assists per game and a 3.6 assist to turnover ratio which ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a good team. But it’s not a better basketball team than Cal, [and] it’s not a better basketball team than us. We’ve got to show up and play,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January  30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/","id":555,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[554,553,552],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Struggles Continue","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos fall to UC Irvine 77-60","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Prior to the UCSB women’s basketball team’s game at UC Irvine, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said her team would double team Camille Buckley on defense, calling her a big-time athlete who will have the opportunity to play at the next level.</p>\n<p>Despite the defensive focus on Buckley, the Gauchos could find no answer for the senior forward.</p>\n<p>Buckley finished the night with a game-high 27 points and 15 rebounds.

Give her credit, she’s a good player, but we allowed her to get things too easy.”</p>\n<p>The loss marks the first loss to Irvine during the Carlene Mitchell rein as Santa Barbara remains winless on the road in Big West play.</p>\n<p>Following Buckley’s lead, the Anteaters outrebounded the Gauchos 43-28. They also shot 26-33 from the free throw line compared to 6-10 for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious there wasn’t an attack mentality in just the discrepancy with the free throws,” Mitchell said. “You’re not going to win on the road no matter who you’re playing if that’s the amount of times we’re sending them to the free throw line. And a lot of those free throws stem from the rebounding side of it. So, rebounding and free throws – that’s the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Similar to all season long, Santa Barbara failed to play a consistent game. The first half saw a back and forth game between UCSB and UCI until the Anteaters finished the first half on a 6-0 run to take a 38-30 halftime lead. Buckley contributed four of those six points.</p>\n<p>Then to open the second half, the Gauchos continued to fall apart. UCSB was unable to find the bottom of the net until 15:56 into the second half, allowing a 10-0 run by the Anteaters. The lead would be too large to overcome as UCSB could only play Irvine even the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>“They took it right at us and we had a turnover on the offensive end the very first possession that led to a layup on that end. It was just back to back,” Mitchell said. “It’s frustrating and our kids didn’t fight through it. You’d like them to be able to make one mistake and not let it carry over to the opposite end of the floor. It did two or three times.”</p>\n<p>With the victory, Irvine remains a perfect 5-0 at home. They improve to 10-10 overall and 3-3 in the Big West. Santa Barbara, on the other hand, drops to 6-13 overall and 1-5 in conference.</p>\n<p>“You have to be positive completely. As a team, we have to stay together and know what our strengths are,” Nesbit said. “We have to treat every game like we’re going in to win every time. It’s about being consistent and putting two halves together.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to rebound quickly as they make the long road trip north to UC Davis Saturday. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/ucsbs-struggles-continue/","id":556,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[555,554,553],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Third Straight at Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-072.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Shaminder-Dhindsa-Girls-Basketball-vs-UCR-072.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is struggling as the Gauchos fell to eighth place in the conference standings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>During Big West play, there has been one dominant storyline for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ downfall is inconsistent play.

The Aggies move into a three-way tie for third place, improving to 9-11 overall and 4-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With a struggling team, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell changed the starting lineup, benching two of her three seniors and instead starting three freshmen, a sophomore and Zornig. The move worked as the Gauchos jumped out to an early 20-9 lead.</p>\n<p>“We just had to mix it up and I was going with effort,” Mitchell said. “It’s obvious what we’ve been doing so far hasn’t worked and we just wanted energy to start the game.”</p>\n<p>However, Davis responded, picking up its defensive intensity by switching into its trapping defense and offensively taking advantage of its size down low. The Aggies stormed back to take a one-point lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Opening up the second half, Santa Barbara came out flat once again. Three-point shots sparked a 7-0 fun for Davis, giving the Aggies a comfortable lead. In the second half, UCD shot 41.7 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have a lot of weapons on their team,” Zornig said. “They have good post players inside and then a lot of them can knock down the three. That’s their game and we knew that.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the second half, UCSB found ways to cut the lead to five or six points several times, but could never come up with the defensive stop needed to get within one possession.</p>\n<p>“At that point, it’s more mental than anything. You can’t trade baskets, especially when you’re down,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “There were a couple times where we would get a stop, we’d go down and score and then miss a box out or something like that. I know we had a couple of key mental mistakes in the second half and things like that cost you games.”</p>\n<p>The biggest discrepancy came at the free throw line. The Aggies, the best free throw shooting team in the Big West, shot 31-36 from the charity stripe while the Gauchos did not stand up to their second place ranking in conference, shooting just 18-29 from the line.</p>\n<p>“I’m not even going to spend the effort talking about their 36 attempts. It was our lack of knocking down the 29 attempts we had,” Mitchell said. “If you’re going to get that many attempts on the road, you have to focus. You win on the road by making layups, not turning the ball over and getting to the free throw line. We got there; we just didn’t knock them down.”</p>\n<p>Davis’ leading scorer, junior forward Sydnee Fipps, scored 21 points for Davis, but it was sophomore forward Alyson Doherty that killed UCSB and exploited its lack of height down low. Although averaging 11.7 points per game, Doherty exploded for a game-high 23 points on 7-11 shooting, including 9-12 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Nesbit led the team with 17 points while Zornig added 14 points and a team-high eight rebounds.
