My arms were hairy, my legs were hairy, my eyebrows looked like caterpillars — the whole works. I’m proud to say that by the time I got to high school, I was already kind of over it. Who the fuck cares if I have hair on my arms? Of course, every so often a blunt child I was babysitting would still point it out, but it just didn’t bother me the way it used to. I assumed that anyone else who had suffered these insecurities was probably over it by now, too. It wasn’t until I learned that one of my best friends shaved her arms about as frequently as she shaved her legs that I realized this was still a problem for women my age.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we care so much about regulating female body hair? It all starts with razor companies. </span><a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/health-hygiene-and-beauty/hair-removal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gillette patented the safety razor in 1904</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As it grew in popularity, being clean shaven became a symbol of basic hygiene. This made at least a little sense at the time: Because many people were living in close quarters and had limited access to bathing, shaving was seen as a way to prevent lice and bacteria. This idea was </span><a href=\"http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/shaving-ads-1920s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heavily marketed to men</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; to be clean shaven was to be a hygienic and civilized man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1920s, things began to change. With a new decade came new fashion trends, and we all know what the 20s are famous for: flapper dresses. This meant that women’s hairy armpits and legs were on full display. </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/137072-100-years-of-shaving-ads-show-how-weve-been-tricked-into-going-hairless-photos\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Razor companies saw this as an opportunity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to sell more razors and began telling women they needed to be smooth. The epidemic spiraled from there, and now generations of women are worried about everything from the hair between their eyebrows to the knuckles of their toes and everything in between. A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it’s pretty fucking ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, so I decided to talk to other women about their relationships to their body hair and how they may or may not have come to embrace it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first woman I talked to was Nisha Jagota, a fourth-year student here at UCSB. One memory that Jagota shared was from fifth grade, when she and her friends discussed what they should and shouldn’t shave before a pool party. “We all got together as a group, like, ‘okay, what’s acceptable, what should we do?’ Nobody had it figured out. Nobody has a good idea of what’s ’right’ so everything’s really convoluted,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From as young an age as 10 or 11, girls already know that they will be judged. They know that there is a “right” and a “wrong,” but the standard is so arbitrary that they’re left guessing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagota told me that she hasn’t worried too much about her body hair since coming to UCSB. One of the biggest moments for her in the journey of her changing relationship with her body hair was participating in the Vagina Monologues and spending time with other women who wore their hair however they wanted to. “It was really great being surrounded by all different types of women, and nonbinary folk as well,” she said. “And visually seeing women who had unshaved armpits wearing tank tops and bras … I’m not gonna say they were making a statement, because maybe they’re not, maybe it’s just for them, but for me, it really was them making a statement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Madi Braum, another student here at UCSB, had a similar experience after leaving high school. “I started shaving my legs consistently when I was in sixth grade, before I even really needed to,” she said. “But for years after that, I refused to go outside the house in shorts if my legs weren’t shaved.” After graduating from high school, however, Braum said something “clicked,” and she hasn’t shaved since. It’s been three years since she put a razor blade to her shins.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dana Laufer is a third-year student at UCSB, and her first memory of being shamed for her body hair is from fifth grade. “I raised my hand in class to answer a question, and a girl said, ‘Oh my god, Dana has armpit hair.’” When she went home that day, she told her mom what happened, and she taught Dana how to use Nair to remove the hair from her armpits, resulting in painful burns that kept her from attending school the following day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Dana got to high school, shaving felt more like an option than a necessity. “My brother used to say it was gross when girls don’t shave their legs,” she said, “but in high school, my friend and I used to have competitions to see who could go the longest without shaving their legs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have no interest in telling anyone how they should maintain the hair on their body. I personally like it when my legs are smooth. However, had I not been socialized to believe that hairy legs are gross, it might be a different story. More than anything, I want every person to be able to make choices that work for them without being subjected to any outside pressure. Let’s just let hairy girls live. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants women to do whatever they damn want with their body hair.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Although I had been eagerly awaiting the adventure since I sent in my application to study abroad, I have to admit that spending my birthday without my friends and family hit harder than I thought it would. As someone with minimal international travel experience, navigating major airports and traveling out of the country solo equated to a great deal of confusion, stress and, at times, tears — sometimes all three at once! However, two layovers and a panicked moment of thinking I’d lost my carry-on in Switzerland later, I had arrived at my final destination: a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve never heard of the country of Cyprus before, don’t worry — I hadn’t either. Last fall, as I looked through the different study abroad programs available, my decision-making process could be summarized as follows: What is Cyprus? Is this… a country? It’s on the EAP website, so it has to be a country. Probably. Where is it? Oh, Google says it’s an island in the Mediterranean Sea.

To put it into perspective, Cyprus is approximately 9,251 square kilometers with a population of about 1 million people, while the United States is approximately 9,833,517 square kilometers with about 323 million more people. However, despite its small size, the country has managed to fill itself with a wide variety of impressive sites and excursions. From exploring the sea caves and cliff jumping at Cape Greco in Ayia Napa to hiking in the Troodos Mountains and seeing small patches of snow, I’ve only just begun to describe the range of activities that can be found on the island. When you have a moment, feel free to Google “Blue Lagoon” in Cyprus. Yes, that’s real. And yes, it’s even more stunning in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Cyprus is more than just a pretty place. Located at the maritime crossroad of three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa), the small island has a robust history spanning 10,000 years. Throughout its existence, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Lusignans, Genoese, Venetians, Ottomans, Britons and Turks have all sought to take the island for themselves. Currently, Cyprus remains divided with the northern third run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the southern two-thirds run by the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot government. In order to visit Northern Cyprus, I had to cross a border with my passport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, more surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me. Despite not speaking a word of Greek, or even knowing substantial information about the country upon arrival, the culture shock I’d anticipated was pretty much nonexistent. Honestly, I kind of relate to the Cypriots’ horrendous parking skills. When I think about the fact that the biggest obstacle I’ve faced so far has been trying to explain what tofu was to the employees at the grocery store, I become aware of just how lucky I am to have stumbled upon this island. Sometimes, I can’t believe that two months have passed by already. I really don’t want to think about how I’ll have to leave my new home in just one month.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of where you decide to study abroad (if you have the opportunity to do it, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), finding your new family will undoubtedly be the best part. There are truly no other people I would rather sprint through both the Frankfurt train station and airport with in order to make our flight or sit through a cold and drizzly six-hour ferry ride from Athens to Naxos with. If you somehow have the fortune to find the right group of people to create a family dinner rotation, to be your travel buddies, to be the reason why a foreign country can somehow be called home, then you’ll understand why I hold this small island so close to my heart. There’s a reason why they say that home isn’t a place, it’s a person — or, in this case, ten people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though some loved ones still send me messages asking, “How is Cypress?” the country’s anonymity only adds to its charm. I’ll miss everything this underrated country has to offer: from the spinach and feta cheese pies to the sweet dog I pass by every day on my way to campus to the memories that will truly last a lifetime. My biggest takeaway from studying abroad is that with an open mind and an open heart, anywhere in the world can become home.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu encourages students to consider studying abroad somewhere unorthodox. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

Now, after months of paperwork and panicking about what I was about to embark on devoid of any safety net, I find myself reflecting on my experience thus far in my room at the University of Bristol, England. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I was on the phone with my mom, talking about how much time had already passed, that I realized how unmistakably happy I was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had come to England with the mindset that I would step fully out of my shell, challenging myself to overcome my social anxiety and make the most of my three months here. And somehow, that’s exactly what I did. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I talked to everyone I could and accepted as many invitations to go out as possible, spending very little time in my flat during those initial weeks. I was doing so well that after introducing my flatmate to my group of study abroad friends, she made a comment about how extraverted I seemed to be. For someone who had spent the majority of her college years in her room, it was a marker of just how far I had come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owe a lot of my happiness here to my fellow UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) students, five of whom are possibly the greatest people I have ever met. Despite telling ourselves that we wouldn’t only hang out with other Americans, I still find myself spending most of my days with them. From impromptu pub crawls to week-long study sessions, I usually see them all at least once a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I write this, I just came back from a weekend spent in Dublin with fifteen other students, thanks to a large group chat that we somehow formed during our international orientation and kept expanding ever since. This Friday I leave for Edinburgh before setting off to Barcelona the next weekend and to London a few days after.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire experience seems so surreal; I had spent so long thinking that studying abroad was nothing more than a dream. If I was homesick in Santa Barbara, which was only a two-hour drive from my home in Huntington Park, how would I ever survive the over five-thousand-mile distance between home and Bristol? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most surprising thing about studying abroad has been the significant improvement to my mental health. Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the summer, right before I was supposed to leave, I hit a wall: my anxiety devolved into a case of a depression that made it hard to leave the bed sometimes. I was beginning to doubt my decision to go abroad without anyone I knew by my side. My family, while well-intentioned, simply encouraged me to look at things in a positive light, overlooking my sudden change in attitude as I counted down the days until my departing flight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But somehow, I made it to our London orientation in September with a clear mind and a resolve to put my best foot forward. I look at what I have accomplished in the almost two months I have been here and am surprised at how, despite missing home, I am not quite as desperate to return as I thought I would be going in.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Velazquez wants you to take a chance on a fresh start by studying abroad. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/569616787b01b4ee0f29f140b8c9f662?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/569616787b01b4ee0f29f140b8c9f662?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tvelazquez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tiffany Velazquez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tiffany is the On The Menu Co-Editor and has been at the Nexus since spring of her freshman year.

I learned to appreciate the curves I was developing, but I still couldn’t find peace from the constant thoughts running through my mind. I was learning body positivity, but it was like putting a Band-Aid on a wound that needed stitches. Some days it worked, and other days, it really didn’t. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contemporary</span><a href=\"https://fusion.tv/story/582813/a-short-history-of-body-positivity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> body positivity movement </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be traced back to around 1960, and since then has grown into a massive ideology that can be found all over the media today. Body positivity is essentially the belief that everyone should feel that their bodies are beautiful. The movement began by centering on reclaiming words like “fat” and “plus-size,” turning them into descriptors rather than insults or words to be ashamed of. Someone can be beautiful and also be fat — they are by no means mutually exclusive. This is how the movement began, and since then, it has expanded to include queer bodies, bodies of color and disabled bodies. Bottom line: Everyone is beautiful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a movement that I wholeheartedly embrace, and I’ve seen it help so many people grow to love themselves more fully and truly. That just wasn’t the case for me.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I got to college that I noticed a change in myself: I slowly stopped caring about what my body looked like. In fact, I forgot to worry about my body at all. Maybe that was the secret: Just don’t think about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I came across the phrase “body neutrality.” </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-body-neutrality_n_5b61d8f9e4b0de86f49d31b4?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACd-gHx8KbrbEr03nIJ1Wr8SW67sDdMuv9l21DwyVphhb54vW1xFYzadoEMWJMkxA5SI2hqzLBy7fpUcjFzJViV2iLDsz79LIVOfuwakqFooox8ebpo_jI6mfiqealV-NeoBp5Ese6WXCx0OSG5CbEZ1R4dmH-Fm7RVOsjycIx8A\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body neutrality</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the practice of not thinking about your body or how it looks at all. I am an active person, so for me, that means thinking about what my body can do, rather than how it looks. I found that the less I overanalyze how my body looks — even if I’m focusing on the positives — the happier I am. My body can swim and dance and hike. It can eat a ridiculous amount of ice cream without feeling sick (it can’t really handle doughnuts though … we’re working on that) and take me from Campbell Hall to I.V. Theater in less than 10 minutes. I can love and appreciate my body so much more when I stop looking in the mirror. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I choose body neutrality over body positivity, I don’t want to suggest that this is what works for everyone. Body positivity was designed for people who were, and still are, attacked, marginalized and discriminated against because of their size, shape or color. Body positivity could be the best practice for those people, and that is incredible. For me, sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it. And that’s not to say that body neutrality is running away from the problem but rather finding a different solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, I began practicing body neutrality by accident and, luckily for me, it worked. I found myself surrounded by people who just didn’t talk about their bodies in the way I was used to. Our lives were about picking a major and studying for midterms. They were about exploring a new campus and a new city. Sorry, no time to worry about whether or not my thighs are touching — I have class in 10 minutes and an essay due at midnight.
