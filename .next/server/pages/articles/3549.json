Community Services District (I.V. CSD) directors voted unanimously to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9E_iYyJ9UF5lbtD0vLNb5y8X4qHc62x3Hb-xQ4J2n8/edit\">send a letter to the UCPD</a>, stating the district “supports a comprehensive independent investigation into these allegations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter further calls for UCPD to hold “a community meeting in order to hear from the public and community members who have been hurt by many of the disturbing allegations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday night’s discussion primarily centered on transparency regarding the allegations, with Board President Spencer Brandt stating he was “disgusted” when he read about the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an incredibly important issue that is very pertinent to us,” Brandt said, referring to the district’s partnerships and relationships with the UCPD Community Service Officers (CSOs) and the UCPD Interpersonal Violence Investigator position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is incredibly important for the public to know how their police department is operating… When allegations like this are made from law enforcement officers against their law enforcement agency and against each other, you just damage the trust that students and residents have for law enforcement. It damages the trust that everyone has with all law enforcement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said he was “struck” by UCPD’s response to reports of the allegations, which he said “was their interim chief saying that ‘We must move past this as a community.’” Bertrand said UCPD first needs to address the concerns of the community before it can move on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that we must move past this as a community, but I also believe that we can make that statement after there’s been an investigation and after they’ve engaged with the community,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaders from sexual assault violence and harassment advocacy groups Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) and UCSB’s Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) also presented statements at the meeting which reflected their concerns and disappointment in the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsa Granados, executive director for STESA, spoke as a representative for the sexual assault advocacy group, stating that she fully supports the I.V. CSD’s letter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the allegations are true, I feel saddened and disappointed,” Granados said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados also made a point to acknowledge the work she believes UCPD has done well, while also calling out those who — “if the allegations are true” — were quiet about the misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sexual violence thrives on that silence… and I know UCPD has been working very hard to make inroads to ending sexual assault, so that cover-up, those allegations, we cannot tolerate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados added that UCPD needs to “work with our entire community to hold those involved accountable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three members from SASA – Emily Montalvo-Telford, Alya Ruiz and Sreya Subramanyan  — read aloud statements regarding the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the majority of those who spoke were from the community, only one police officer, I.V. Foot Patrol station commander Juan Camarena of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), spoke during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camarena assured the community that he “keeps his people accountable” and that police officers are there to serve the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just want to assure you that we’re here for you, that even though you feel that we have broken that trust, I want you guys to reach out to us. We are still here for you and anything that we could do to rebuild that trust, please let us know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the closing discussion, I.V. CSD Director Robert Geis stressed the implications of the allegations for the department if proven true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The department cannot be silent on this. If it’s really happening in their department, then they have a really big issue to solve and really a tough process to go through to solve that issue.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [10:39 a.m.]: The name of the one of the speakers from SASA is </em><em>Alia Reynolds, not Alya Ruiz, as stated in a previous version of this article.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

student regent-designate — both of which are currently held by UC graduate students, Huang said in an email sent out to all UC student newspapers.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the Student Advisor position strips away essential student representation at the highest level of UC governance and rejects years of hard-fought work to bring the student voice into university governance,” Huang said in the

sent to the Regents</a>, Regent Richard Sherman recommended the position be eliminated because of the existence of other opportunities for student representation on the board, such as the positions of Student Advocates to the Regents and Student Observers to Standing Committees.</p>\n<p>If the Regents vote to remove the position, there will no longer be an undergraduate student representative serving on the board after Huang’s term ends in June 2019.</p>\n<p>The intended goal of the Student Advisor position was to provide insight on the issues and concerns of the student populations not represented by the Student Regent, according to Sherman’s letter.</p>\n<p>Student Regent Devon Graves recommended the removal of the position, Huang said.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Student-Regent-Graves-Statement-Re-Student-Advisor-Pilot-Program.pdf\">separate press release</a>, Graves said he made the recommendation on the basis of student perspectives from UCSA, UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) and Council of Presidents, which reflected that other programs are more effective in representing student voices than the Student Advisor position.</p>\n<p>He also said he wants to support “other opportunities to ensure a diversity of student perspectives” while transitioning out of the student advisor position.</p>\n<p>UC Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/regents-to-vote-on-student-advisor-proposal/\">originally voted</a> on the creation of the position in 2016 after it was

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/regents-approve-student-advisor-position-for-trial-period/\">passed the proposal</a> unanimously and agreed to a two-year trial for the position, at the end of which the Regents would assess the effectiveness of the position.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 29]: Huang later recanted his statement about UCSA.

Since 2015, the UC system overall has accepted an additional 14,500 California undergraduates and aims to increase this in the coming years, as stated in the press release.</p>\n<p>“Part of UC’s mission is to do everything possible to help students reach their college dreams,” UC Regents Vice Chair John A. Perez added in the press release.</p>\n<p>“We continue to do so in a number of ways, including addressing the total cost of attendance, such as food and housing needs, and working to develop a multiyear strategic plan that not only supports students’ financial needs but also expands access to UC for more Californians.”</p>\n<p>Rising college costs, coupled with a growing movement calling for tuition-free colleges, have made tuition hikes increasingly controversial as the Regents discuss it each year. Students groups typically attend Regents meetings to argue against the hikes.</p>\n<p>Last year, the UC Regents voted to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-07-19/uc-regents-vote-to-decrease-tuition-by-60/\">lower</a> in-state tuition by $60 – a result from eliminating legal fees – and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised</a> out-of-state tuition tuition by 3.5 percent.</p>\n<p>As of Fall Quarter 2018, out-of-state students compose approximately 21 percent, or over 58,500 students, of the UC system. In 2017, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/regents-approve-nonresident-enrollment-cap/\">voted</a> to limit the number of out-of-state students allowed at each UC to 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The non resident numbers include both students from other states within the U.S. as well as international students.</p>\n<p>As of the 2018-2019 school year, <a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\">the cost of attending UCSB</a> as an in-state undergraduate who lives in an on-campus residence hall amounts to approximately $36,798; for an in-state undergraduate who lives off campus, this number drops to $33,768.</p>\n<p>Those numbers increase for nonresident students.</p>\n<p>However, according to the press release, about 57 percent of current California undergraduates pay no tuition, and an additional 20 percent have part of the costs covered by financial aid programs.</p>\n<p>The Regents will vote on whether or not to raise out-of-state tuition for the 2019-2020 during its upcoming meeting this week.

her time, according to a statement released by UC President Janet Napolitano on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We were extremely honored and fortunate to have Ellen serve on the UC Board of Regents where her expertise and passion for quality education… helped us navigate complex issues facing the university,” Napolitano said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Before sitting on the board, she held a seat in Congress, worked on Wall Street for 14 years and was one of the first female members of the New York Stock Exchange, according to the UC Regents website.</p>\n<p>While in Congress, Tauscher served in several subcommittees, including within the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee.</p>\n<p>Tauscher also received her bachelor’s degree in early childhood development from Seton Hall University.</p>\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom also released a statement on Tauscher’s passing, stating Tauscher “blazed trails in business and in the halls of Congress” and “held her own at some of the world’s toughest negotiating tables.”</p>\n<p>In their statements, both Gavin and Napolitano spoke about Tauscher’s “grace” during pressing times.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein described Tauscher as “brilliant, gracious and generous” in a statement she released after Tauscher’s death.</p>\n<p>“She had a knack for getting to the bottom of an issue smartly but also in ways that people could really understand. She truly loved her country and it was an honor to work with her,” Feinstein said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Tauscher joined the Board of Regents in June 2017 after being appointed by former California Governor Jerry Brown. She was one of 17 other appointed regents who sat on the board, in addition to Napolitano.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
