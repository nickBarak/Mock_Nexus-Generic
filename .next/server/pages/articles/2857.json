The dishes were separated into appetizers, entrées and desserts, and attendees were invited to sample and vote for their favorites, while the winners of each category received a gift card to the Isla Vista Food Co-op.</p>\n<p>EAB Green Chef Coordinator Kristen Herrera said the required ingredient is always locally grown and organic.</p>\n<p>“We basically take local, organic, in-season foods and we distribute that to students so that they can then make their own dishes with whatever that ingredient is,” Herrera said. “The I.V. Food Co-op has given us the beets that are the highlight.”</p>\n<p>EAB Co-Chair Heather Vest said the event started several years ago, and said it encourages students to cook using sustainable, local foods by providing the ingredients for free.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pretty big event. Every quarter people come out and love to cook. … I think it teaches a lot about how to cook sustainably in I.V., which is really important,” Vest said. “It also just teaches people how to cook in general. Giving recipes out and stuff, it’s awesome.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61466\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61466\" data-attachment-id=\"61466\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/cooking-competitors-beets-beat-others/green-chef_paris-cullen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425233918\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"27\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Green Chef Comp\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61466\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Is it beets?

It’s good for helping our local farmers instead of farmers from who-knows-where. It strengthens community bonds,” Laskorunsky said. “I like the idea of community coming together for a common purpose, and getting local food is a part of that.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major Maxine Hamilton and fourth-year biology and environmental studies major Veronica Emrich both cooked one the event’s winning dishes — Thai beet stew with creamy peanut sauce. Hamilton said she largely enjoyed the Green Chef competition because it engaged students to actively think about the environmental impacts of food production.</p>\n<p>“I’m all about sustainable food and how food relates to our impact on the environment,” Hamilton said. “I think it’s an important topic to get people on campus thinking about, and it’s a really fun way to do it because everybody gets free food.”</p>\n<p>The Green Chef competition will take place again Spring quarter with a new special ingredient selected by EAB Green Chef Coordinator Herrera.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/cooking-competitors-beets-beat-others/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/cooking-competitors-beets-beat-others/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/cooking-competitors-beets-beat-others/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/cooking-competitors-beets-beat-others/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/cooking-competitors-beets-beat-others/","id":2857,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2856,2855,2854],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"New Note-Taking Tool in the Works","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students’ Office of the Controller is currently conducting research on how to improve student information gathering in the classroom through a new collaborative note-taking program.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_54246\" style=\"width: 834px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"995623800\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61385\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54246\" data-attachment-id=\"54246\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/curiouser-and-curiouser-last-lecturer-shares-his-story/mylastlecture_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?fit=1498%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1498,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Peter Vandenbelt VBDphotos.com\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1393445111\",\"copyright\":\"Peter R.

The research has taken place in several academic subjects including sociology and communication over the course of 11 total lectures.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year electrical engineering major and A.S. controller Amir Khazaieli, research is still in its experimental stage but the goal of A.S. is to eventually offer a medium that would allow one to become more engaged with their lectures.</p>\n<p>“This is a very, very extensive project that has been in the works for over a year,” Khazaieli said. “Half of it is just providing new tools in lecture to gather information. The other half of it is to provide an interface for students to be able to collaboratively edit and review this information.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said while the Google Doc program is still in its “inception” phase, the program offers a wide variety of benefits to students.</p>\n<p>“The notes that come out of this kind of situation have proven to be a lot more complete, in the sense that a lot more thought-driven analysis goes into what they’re [students are] hearing rather than trying to frantically copy and paste everything that’s said,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>However, classics professor Helen Morales said she prohibits A.S. from passing out flyers promoting the program outside her Greek Mythology lecture because the program allegedly violates UC policy on lecture material distribution.</p>\n<p>“In a nutshell, the A.S. shared note-taking initiative breaks UC Policy 102.23 which expressly forbids students from recording lectures or discussions and from distributing or selling lecture notes and all other course materials without the prior written permission of the instructor,” Morales said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morales said the initiative seemed a lot like <em>studysoup.com</em> and other online initiatives which sell lecture notes to students.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line for me is that students who use them don’t do as well as students who don’t use them,” Morales said. “It’s important to realize that the process of taking notes during lectures is as important as the notes themselves. … So I think that this initiative encourages students not to take their own notes.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli however, the research A.S. is doing is legal and unlike other online note-sharing programs Morales mentioned.</p>\n<p>“I think some people are equating what we are doing with other services that get students to upload lecture slides, content and notes, which they sell to other people to make money,” Khazaieli said. “This is not what is being done at all.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said the note-taking program would only allow access codes within the course to access the document if the program is introduced as an option for lecture attendees.“In order to access the Google Doc you need to get the unique link that we would pass out as you’re walking into class, so it ensures you have to be in class to first access the Google Doc, and then it’s taken down afterwards,” Khazaieli said. “It would also be moderated, so anybody who is not actively participating will be kicked off. So it’s not like you can access it and not take notes.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said the note-taking program’s collaborative nature is not breaking UC policy because it will give all students an equal opportunity to contribute to the Google Doc.</p>\n<p>“We would not be taking lecture content and lecture slides,” Khazaieli said. “Its student’s interpretations and what they’ve heard. The only difference between this and taking paper notes is that this is online.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli, the A.S. Office of the Controller is in the process of finding the best way to implement the program to make it as easily accessible and function as possible.</p>\n<p>“It’s been about doing more controlled research tests to figure out how to tune the cogs and the wheels so that when the final product comes out it’s something that everybody loves and can use effectively,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Brian Lee said he would be open to any type of effort by A.S. to make information gathering in classrooms more collaborative, but said he would not use the technology himself.</p>\n<p>“I think something like this would be useful for studying because other people could clarify ideas from lecture,” Lee said. “I don’t think I would use it because I feel like I get a better understanding of material by putting it in my own words.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Any individual can register and participate, and at the first Dance Marathon event held last year, hundreds of dancers participated and raised around $13,000 for Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological science major and co-chair of Dance Marathon Molly Morrison said there are over 250 college campuses that put on dance marathons, making Dance Marathon the largest collegiate philanthropy effort in the nation.</p>\n<p>“I helped found dance marathon, but our first event wasn’t until last March 1,” Morrison said in an email. “This year, we have 600 students registered to go to the event, and our goal is $25,000.”</p>\n<p>According to Morrison, the event raises money for the Children’s Miracle Network hospitals, specifically the Cottage Children’s Hospital in downtown Santa Barbara, which, according to Morrison, is an essential part of healthcare on the central coast.</p>\n<p>“Cottage Children’s Hospital is the only hospital with a level 2 neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric intensive care unit in central California, making this hospital a vital one for many families in the state,” Morrison said in an email.</p>\n<p>At the Dance Marathon event, food will be provided and participants will be split into teams, each representing a different patient from the Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>“The food is catered, entertainment is provided, including student DJs, a cappella groups, and dance groups from the UCSB campus,” Morrison said. “In addition, dancers are split into color teams, with a child ambassador from Cottage Children’s Hospital on their team. It’s a great way for UCSB students to make a tangible difference in their community during their time here, and to see exactly where the money they raised is going.”</p>\n<p>According to Morrison, Dance Marathon aims to expand even more in the coming years.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited to see our growth from last year to this year, and to see how dance marathon can grow on this campus, and perhaps one day be the philanthropy by what UCSB is known for!” Morrison said.</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Claire Meyer said she just joined Dance Marathon this year and that the group has been preparing for the event for the past few months.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working for months with fundraising,” Meyer said, “I can’t wait to meet the kids and families that we are fundraising for. My brother did a dance marathon at Ohio State and he said it was one of the most awesome experiences of his college career.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/","id":2855,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2854,2853,2852],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCPD Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2004-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Monday, Oct. 4, 10:47 a.m.: A RecCen supervisor received a voice mail making negative sexual references and threatening his life.

Officers reported the male caller to have said in the voice mail, “I’ll kill you and kick your ass.” He followed by more name-calling and said, “If you don’t settle down, you will lose your job.”</p>\n<p>The supervisor suspects the caller to be one of the students with whom he had a confrontation in the weight room last week.

When officers arrived at the scene, they found two men walking in the median toward Francisco Torres, hitting road signs with poles. Officers spoke to the men and determined that they were intoxicated.</p>\n<p>Both men were arrested for public intoxication and sent to Santa Barbara County Jail pending sobriety. The road signs were checked but found to have sustained no significant damage from the poles.</p>\n<p>Cheech and Chong</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 1, 1:17 p.m.: Officers were stationed at the intersection of Pardall Rd. and Embarcadero del Norte to watch for seatbelt violations. Officers spotted the male driver and passenger of one passing vehicle hurriedly putting their seatbelts on. The vehicle was stopped for questioning and officers discovered that stereo equipment was being illegally sold out of the vehicle without a permit.</p>\n<p>While the entrepreneurs were being warned about the possible consequences of their illegal sales, the officers noticed a marijuana pipe in plain view on the center console of the car. A search of the vehicle revealed the driver to be in possession of marijuana and a suspended license.</p>\n<p>Officers seized the marijuana and the driver of the vehicle was cited for driving with a suspended license, driving without a seat belt and possession of marijuana. </p>\n<p>– Compiled by Lindsey Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-7967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-7967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/","id":2856,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[2855,2854,2853],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
