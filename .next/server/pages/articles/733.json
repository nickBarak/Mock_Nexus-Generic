With UCSB’s final game of the season this Saturday and the Big West postseason tournament next week, both center Alan “Big Al” Williams and point guard T.J. Taylor will have a major say in whether UCSB can make it back to the Big Dance for a third consecutive season.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun being the two young guys getting the minutes on the team,” Williams said. “In preseason and stuff we were saying that we wanted to start, and we knew that if we kept working hard it could happen.”</p>\n<p>Entering the school year last summer, both Williams and Taylor expected they would be watching most games wearing street clothes as redshirt freshmen.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Coming in, we both thought we would have to redshirt,” Taylor said. “Then a couple of guys got hurt or whatever, and we both got the opportunity to play more.”</p>\n<p>Both freshmen have taken advantage of the opportunity, running with it all the way to starting jobs. Williams has started 14 of 24 games overall for the Gauchos, including 13 of 14 in conference play. Taylor has started nine games overall for UCSB, including eight in conference.</p>\n<p>“Al and T.J. have really both created their own opportunities by playing well when given the chance,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Especially Al; every time he played he was productive and his minutes just got extended as he carved out a niche for himself.”</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that anyone who has seen a UCSB game this season knows Williams’ niche is rebounding the basketball. The 6’7” big man is currently averaging 8.2 rebounds per game in conference play, good for third in the Big West. His 1.9 blocks per game also rank third in the Big West. Impressively, Williams has more offensive rebounds on the season, a statistic in which he ranks first place in the league, than defensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I know my biggest impact is rebounding the ball,” Williams said. “It takes pressure off my guards knowing they can put up shots and I’m under the basket rebounding … I just try to go after it and get it done — it’s fun to work hard.” <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/T.J.-Taylor-vs-UNLV_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=307%2C220\" alt=\"\" width=\"307\" height=\"220\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>“It is invaluable to know your role as a player,” coach Williams said. “The key to being successful, whether you are a player on a team or in a corporation, is that you see what you can bring to the table. … Al sees what he brings, he does what he is best at and he is excited about doing it every day.”</p>\n<p>Big Al has become a fan favorite this season, as the Gaucho Locos’ cheers often reach their loudest after Williams blocks a shot, grabs an offensive rebound or dives for a loose ball.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of fun to go out there and try to bring as much energy as possible,” Williams said. “Our fans are loud and supportive … we do it for them, we represent this whole campus and school, it feels good that they are supporting us.”</p>\n<p>Standing at 5’9”, Taylor is the lightning to Williams’ thunder. Often the smallest guy on the court, Taylor makes up for his lack of size with exceptional speed and fearlessness.</p>\n<p>“He has got great quickness and is a natural leader,” coach Williams said. “He has this natural charisma about him that is just contagious.”</p>\n<p>As a young point guard often asked to run a veteran-laden team, the responsibility of being a leader is magnified. Taylor, who ranks fifth on the team in minutes and third in assist-to-turnover ratio in conference, is accepting and embracing the challenge with an eye toward the future.</p>\n<p>“If I can become a good leader for this team with a veteran group, it will help me in the future,” Taylor said. “I would like to work on becoming more vocal, more fearless and just fully taking advantage of the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The recruiting experiences for Williams and Taylor were not alike, as different circumstances in the past few years eventually brought the pair to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Williams played high school basketball in Phoenix, Arizona, and was not highly recruited out of high school despite winning two state championships in his sophomore and junior seasons.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really start getting recruited until the summer between my junior year and senior year,” Williams said. “That was the last recruiting period so I guess you could say I was a late bloomer.”</p>\n<p>Initially unsure of whether Williams was a good fit for UCSB, coach Williams decided to make an offer after attending a tournament to watch him play.</p>\n<p>“Watching him in a tournament in Arizona, I remember a specific play where he was running the length of the floor at full speed,” coach Williams recalled. “He picks up a ball thrown at his ankles in a dead sprint and finished with a finger roll right over the rim … a guy with that kind of ability for a big man is just rare.”</p>\n<p>Taylor’s path to UCSB began differently. Out of Oakland, Taylor had originally committed to Santa Clara as a sophomore before later deciding to reopen his recruiting. That is when coach Williams swooped in.</p>\n<p>“I liked T.J., but I fell in love with the kid when it came down to the in-home visit,” coach Williams said. “When I went in the home and got to know his family and his mother and grandmother, I fell in love with the kid. I walked out of the home and said I would really love to have him — he would be a great fit for our program.”</p>\n<p>As this year’s squad looks to close out its season with a Big West championship and trip to the NCAA Tournament, Williams and Taylor understand that their impact at UCSB will be felt for years to come.</p>\n<p>“It only gets better,” Taylor said. “We don’t plan on having any dip in the program in the future. We will be coming strong here for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>“We will be the sophomore veterans next year,” Williams added.</p>\n<p>A bit of an oxymoron, but that is quite possibly the truth. As the only two regular starters returning to a team that will lose five seniors to graduation, much of the leadership roles will fall on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>“That’s why it’s good for us to be out there getting the experience,” Taylor said. “To set the tone for the next three years.”</p>\n<p>While excited and optimistic about the program’s future, coach Williams remains reserved with his expectations.</p>\n<p>“They have some big shoes to fill,” coach Williams said. “They still have a lot to prove. … However, I love the fact that they are excited about it and I do think this freshman class has a chance to be as great as our graduating senior class right now.”</p>\n<p>The immediate future will allow both Williams and Taylor to make a difference in the Gauchos’ postseason run this season, but the freshman duo will have three more years to make a lasting impact on the UCSB men’s basketball program.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/freshmen-pair-big-impact-ucsb/","id":733,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[732,731,730],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush","biography":"Not available","articles":[721,733,736,737,740,754,756,757,759,761,764,774,780,783,784,787,788,791,792,793,796,799,800,806,810,811,813,821,822,824,834,839,841,907,1235,1736,1743,1745,1759,2282,2291,2301,2303,2789,2809,2826,2893,2895,2896,3496,5511,5515,5518,5522,5526,5527,5528,5532,5535,5537,5538,5539,5541,5545,5546,5553,5554],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Welcomes University of Pacific to the Thunderdome for Big West Matchup","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will play the second of a three-game homestand tonight against the University of the Pacific.

UCSB has lost six straight games to the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“We have to play with confidence,” Mason said. “We have nothing to lose, so we have to play like that.”</p>\n<p>Most known for their trapping defense, the Aggies feature the second best scoring defense in conference, just behind the Gauchos. They’re also second in the Big West in steals, averaging 10.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“Davis is always a tricky game with the system they play,” sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I think for us early on, we need to be sharp and focused. We can’t be loose with the ball because Davis really takes advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to be patient and calm to find success on offense, which was an issue against Pacific yesterday. UCSB reverted back to their shooting woes from earlier in the season, only scoring 15 points in the second half, shooting 7-28 from the field.</p>\n<p>“There wasn’t the ‘let’s get it done’ mentality,” junior guard Destini Mason said. “Davis is definitely different from other teams, so we really going to have to focus offensively.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies, who lead the league in three point field goals made per game with seven, killed the Gauchos from behind the arc in the last matchup, shooting 54.5 percent in the first period. Hannah Stephens led all scorers with 16, including 4-5 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“[Stephens] hit four threes in the first half and we did a better job in the second half,” Mitchell said. “Once someone knocks down one or two threes, you should know they’re a shooter and get your hands up.”</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s loss, both Pacific and UCSB came out strong. Early in the first half, there were seven ties and eight lead changes. However, with the score tied at 21 apiece, the Tigers mounted a 15-4 run to end the first half and took an 11 point lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>After halftime, it seemed nothing would go right for the Gauchos. After the Gauchos closed the gap to single digits, Pacific went on an 18-0 run. The Tigers kept control the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t connecting defensively,” Mason said. “I felt we were scrambling a lot and also weren’t executing the offenses. They’re at home and they took the momentum.”</p>\n<p>Gena Johnson led the Tigers with 17 points and three steals. Erica McKenzie also contributed 12 points, all in the first half.

The game at home was a nail biter throughout until an 8-0 run by the Tigers down the stretch clinched the win.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re a very different team,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We’re getting points from the inside, so there’s a lot more balance than there was in the beginning of the season.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos will look to their leading scorer, senior guard Emilie Johnson, UCSB has plenty of options, including sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit, who led the team offensively in the last matchup against UOP with 10 points. Also, in the last six games, junior center Kristen Tilleman has provided a presence inside, averaging 10.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing a lot smoother on the offensive end of things,” Mitchell said. “We did a decent job against them defensively [last time], but at that time, we were really struggling offensively. If we can find a flow early, I like our chances.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos will continue to rely on their league leading defense. On average, UCSB holds its opponents to 35.6 percent shooting and 51.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ defense will square off against Pacific’s potent offense, which ranks second in the Big West in scoring at about 70 points per game. The Tigers also rank second in three point shooting field goals per game, averaging 5.7. UCSB will need to get its hands up, since this is an area that opponents have successfully taken advantage of all year.</p>\n<p>Pacific’s offense is also very balanced. They feature two of the top nine scorers in the Big West in junior forward Kendall Rodriguez and junior guard Erica McKenzie.</p>\n<p>“We play everyone straight up man,” Mitchell said. “We’ll probably look at different people guarding players that hurt us last game, but that’ll be the only adjustment we make.”</p>\n<p>The two teams contain three of the top rebounders in conference — Rodriguez for Pacific and Tilleman and Underwood for the Gauchos. Last time, the Tigers won the rebounding battle 39-31, despite Tilleman’s 12 boards.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets and Tilleman] typically take care of their job on the rebounding side, but we’ll need players like Destini Mason and Kelsey Adrian and other guards getting the long rebounds because they shoot a lot of threes,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Alex G. Spanos Center.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45156\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45156\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-01/twogame-road-trip-begins-pacific/","id":732,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[731,730,729],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
