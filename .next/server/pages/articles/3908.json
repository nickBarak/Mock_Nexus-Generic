Though a significant amount of the country voted to put a woman in the highest office in the land, others are more concerned about what the candidate’s policies were.</p>\n<p>Eileen Boris, professor in the Department of Feminist Studies at UCSB, said feminist leaders are necessary, and while the gender of the president is significant, it is more important for there to be a feminist, in particular, in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>“I think it makes more of a difference [if] we have a feminist in the White House … It makes more of a difference not the embodiment of the person but the policies of a person,” Professor Boris said.</p>\n<p>As for what particular policies a feminist would bring into office, Boris said, a feminist in office will bring a commitment to what is often called the ‘working family dilemma,’ that is, how do we organize the relationship between getting a living and daily life.”</p>\n<p>In local politics, Joan Hartmann secured the Third District Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors seat on Tuesday, beating rival Bruce Porter 13,563 to 11,511.</p>\n<p>When asked whether Hartmann’s election to the board of supervisors would make a difference in the community, Boris seemed to summarize many of the general election’s prevailing tensions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74136\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1780941814\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74125\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74136\" data-attachment-id=\"74136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/local-women-gain-power-in-government/hbj-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hbj-by-jenny-luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74136\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HBJ-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Hannah-Beth Jackson speaks to a supporter at the Democrat watch party Tuesday.

The officers approached the crowd to investigate what was happening.</p>\n<p>According to one of the spectators, they had been walking by when they spotted the student passed out in the bushes. They then dragged him to the curb and attempted to ascertain a place they could take him.</p>\n<p>But as the deputies discovered, the ruined reveler was in no state to be answering questions. Sitting there with his head hanging low, the UCSB student had the whole spectrum of bodily fluids staining his body, including a mucus-covered face, vomit-stained shirt and urine-soaked jeans.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the deputies began dragging the man to a patrol car that they got anything out of him: projectile vomit.</p>\n<p>After soiling the back seat of the patrol car, the man was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Say My Name</strong></p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 21, 10:49 p.m. — An act of drunken vandalism proved disastrous for one Isla Vista resident.</p>\n<p>Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by a distraught female complaining that an inebriated passerby had snapped the antenna off her car. What’s more, she told the officers her friends had kept the vandal in place through the cunning use of distraction.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the 18-year-old man and could immediately tell he was exceptionally drunk. They asked the man his name, to which he replied, “What’s my name.” When asked his age, he replied “What’s my age.”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the inebriated local would answer by simply repeating the question. Frustrated, the officers arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: To Be Expected</strong></p>\n<p>Sun., Nov. 22, 12:22 a.m. — Deputies on patrol couldn’t help but notice an especially raucous partier stumbling down Del Playa Drive early Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>With a plastic beer helmet snuggly in place atop his head, the 18-year-old struggled to navigate the bustle surrounding him. After nearly falling on own his volition, the Cal Poly Mustang then stumbled into a fair-skinned Gaucho, who nearly fell herself.</p>\n<p>After being told off, the drunken man turned and tried out his best pick up line: “Fuck you!” But instead of snatching one of Isla Vista’s famed beauties, he was snatched by I.V.’s other famed demographic, the not-so-beautiful Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>A quick conversation with the foul-mouthed Mustang was all the fodder the officers needed, who promptly arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/","id":3905,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3904,3903,3902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. - Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Audacity of Douche</b><br>\nFri Jan. 8, 11:15 p.m. – Officers on patrol Friday night were directed towards the corner of Del Playa Drive and Camino Lindo on reports of vehicular vandalism.</p>\n<p>Minutes earlier, a young man was driving down the 6800 block of DP when a drunken savage came out of nowhere and leaped onto the roof of his car. Taken aback, the driver stepped on the gas and then abruptly hit the brakes in the hopes of shaking the crazed reveler, but succeeded only in shifting his body onto the hood.</p>\n<p>Reacting to this boorish move by the driver, the inebriated cowboy stood up on the hood, shouted “What the fuck?!” and slammed his heel through the front windshield, shattering it instantly.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived some minutes later, and, thanks to their superb training, were able to track down the suspect without difficulty. It was made easier, however, by the fact that their man had managed to fall asleep while standing.</p>\n<p>The officers woke the 20-year-old Menlo Park resident and put him in handcuffs. Having been read his Miranda rights, the vandal turned to the officer and said, “I would like to know what I’m being charged with.” The deputy explained that kicking through a windshield is in fact a crime, to which the suspect replied, “I just want to know what I’m being charged with.”</p>\n<p>Despite several explanations, the inebriated man was unable to comprehend why he was arrested. Nonetheless, the audacious young man was transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>How Not to Win Him Back</b><br>\nThu Jan. 7, 1:15 a.m. – Deputies on patrol were called to an apartment at 760 Embarcadero del Mar early Thursday on reports that an especially intoxicated young lady refused to leave her ex’s abode.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and found the inebriated 21-year-old in the living room searching for something. She told the deputies she wouldn’t leave without her cell phone battery, but after a moving good cop/bad cop routine, the officers were able to convince her otherwise.</p>\n<p>Love is a difficult beast to break, however. An hour and a half later, the deputies received another call saying that the girl had returned, this time with even more alcohol on her breath. The deputies arrived and escorted her out of the apartment and down the stairs.</p>\n<p>At first refusing to answer any questions, the UCSB student quickly changed tactics and demanded that the officers take her to jail. To prove she was serious, she then ordered them to do so.</p>\n<p>Happy to oblige, the deputies took her to the I.V. substation, where she insisted they give her a breathalyzer test. The deputy instructed her that was not necessary, but she continued to demand one.</p>\n<p>The issue was put to rest, however, when the officers transferred her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/","id":3906,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3905,3904,3903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Exciting Events Happening in Isla Vista This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I.V. politics will be popping this week, what with the Third Disrict County Supervisor debate, the push to register at least 13,000 I.V. residents to vote for the November election.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Get the low-down on all things I.V. for the week, from the return of First Fridays to SBCF’s monthly food distribution</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_72921\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72921\" data-attachment-id=\"72921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/vista-point-by-mclane-brown/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"vista-point-by-mclane-brown\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72921\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vista-Point-by-McLane-Brown-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"I.V. politics will be popping this week, what with the Third Disrict County Supervisor debate, the push to register at least 13,000 I.V. residents to vote for the November elections and the meeting for the future of the IVCC.

Community Center will be held at 5 p.m. Thursday at the I.V. Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>FOODBANK</strong><br>\nThe Santa Barbara County Foodbank hosts its monthly food distribution Thursday at Isla Vista Elementary School from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. The event is part of the Healthy School Pantry Program, which works to address food insecurity amongst children and families in the community. The Foodbank is simultaneously hosting a Community Resources Fair at the event for residents to learn where they can find food resources in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p><strong>FIRST FRIDAY</strong><br>\nI.V. First Fridays will return to the calendar at 8 p.m. Friday in Perfect Park. The event, which happens the first Friday of every month, will feature free food from C’est Cheese, China Pavilion at Chapala, Kyle’s Kitchen and Woodstock’s Pizza. The event will also feature live music from local acts Choice, Kaysin and The Real Savage Henry. The event is intended to provide a safe form of late-night entertainment in I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>COMPOSTING</strong><br>\nA representative from Healing Grounds Nursery will be leading a home gardening and composting workshop at 12 p.m. Saturday in front of the I.V. Food Co-op. Snacks will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>VEGAN</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Cafe). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>VOTERS</strong><br>\nCommunity volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters with as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record by registering thousands more for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24</p>\n<p><strong>STATE OF THE UNION</strong><br>\nThe next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday, Oct. 13 at the I.V. Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>IVRPD</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 13 in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>DEBATE</strong><br>\nThe Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/vista-point-exciting-events-happening-in-isla-vista-this-week/","id":3907,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3906,3905,3904],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
