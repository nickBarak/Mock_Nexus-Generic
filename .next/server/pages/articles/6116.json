First, that huge leverage was an artifact of the fractional reserve system of money that the world has been using since the end of the gold standard. This allows for the creation of leverage. The problem here is that our fiat money system only works in a constantly expanding economy. When the economy slows, contracts and starts heading in the wrong direction, shit can hit the fan fast because it doesn’t take much for banks to become under-capitalized. Calling out Ron Paul here is backward and totally wrong since he’s such a huge proponent of the gold standard. Something like this could not happen under a gold standard even if you had less regulation.</p>\n<p>Second, the executives at MF Global co-mingled funds from their own trades and their customers, which is illegal. People are going to end up in jail for this. All this you neglected to mention.</p>\n<p>Next time please look at both sides of the situation, not just the bits that best fit your views. It’s time we get some real change and fresh ideas. Ron Paul and others like him know what’s wrong here and have been trying to warn the country that this economic crisis was going to happen years before. Nobody in power did; instead, they perpetuated it and the media openly laughed at them. You can keep trying the same old thing in 2012, but I know who I’ll be voting for come next year, even if I have to write his name in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

As students opposing divestment confined the voice of Palestinians to Hamas and terrorists, they illustrated their preference to reject history, facts and reality in order to rationalize their privilege rather than to resist the status quo or to question existing power structures. Instead of disputing the occupation or the fact that companies are profiting off the occupation, students stood up one after another sharing the discomfort that they personally felt with the “Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid.” Senators and student speakers alike advocated for a more “peaceful” and “less divisive” means of achieving understanding and peace.</p>\n<p>Dialogue assumes that both parties need to take responsibility for the occupation and that both parties are on an equal playing field; however, the 27,000 home demolitions since 1967, 5,224 Palestinian prisoners, 98 checkpoints, 340 temporary checkpoints and 50 unmanned physical barriers to Palestinians, the Apartheid Wall, the 3,000 military orders that govern Palestinians and a justice system that does not comply with international law all paint a very different picture. Dialogue itself is a privilege that is not afforded to Palestinians, so students have the responsibility to utilize whatever power they choose to put an end to the subjugation of Palestinians. Most importantly, dialogue assumes that it is racial, ethnic or religious tensions that have fueled this “conflict” for 65-plus years rather than economic and political power structures that have oppressed people across the globe. While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees rights to all people, regardless of nationality, gender, sexuality, ethnicity or race, the process of dehumanization makes it unbearably easy to exclude Palestinians.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Students uncritically vilified Hamas as a terrorist organization with no consideration of the severity of the situation in Gaza, which has been under a blockade since 2007, and with complete disregard for the conditions upon which Hamas was elected in Gaza. Hamas was democratically elected by the Palestinians in Gaza in 2006 in light of extreme levels of poverty, unemployment and resource exploitation by Israel, but this government was declared a terrorist organization and sanctioned by some of the worst worldwide offenders of “terrorism,” such as the United States and Israel. This is not a justification of rocket attacks, nor do I believe any Israeli deserves their life to be taken in the name of resistance, but this is an honest, critical discussion on militancy amongst peoples that have been colonized and occupied for too many years. While students could and should debate Hamas as a legitimate governing entity, it comes down to economic involvement in the occupation, and we as students are not invested in Hamas, Iran or Syria.</p>\n<p>Other students completely refused to address the human rights violations and instead disputed the legitimacy of the numerous organizations that have investigated Israel’s human rights violations. Organizations worldwide have actively investigated the current occupation — Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, B’Tselem, Al-Haq, Defense for Children International, Addameer, Adalah, Badil and the Israeli Coalition Against House Demolitions, but anti-divestment speakers went through the list and de-legitimized the work of each organization, claiming that these organizations, along with Students for Justice in Palestine, exceptionalize Israel. It was not SJP that exceptionalized Israel with this resolution; rather, it was students that continued to overlook Israel’s human rights violations in the face of deeply ingrained nationalism. As students came up time after time stating that they were true advocates for peace, but anti-divestment, I couldn’t help but wonder when peace became synonymous with submissiveness.</p>\n<p>Regardless, we made a plea to the Associated Students government to divest our holdings from five companies that profit off the military occupation of Palestine. Senator and President-elect Ali Guthy belittled the resolution, saying that it was nothing more than a statement and that the regents would never divest from these companies. What Guthy fails to realize is that this is reminiscent of arguments made against organizers working to divest from South African Apartheid. Senator Andre Theus argued that this resolution alienated too many students on this campus. Other senators came prepared with speeches and scripts, leading us to believe that they had made up their mind prior to hearing the testimonies of students.</p>\n<p>As senators cite representation and alienation as the reasoning behind voting down this resolution, they fail to recognize that this resolution is the product of a coalition of organizations including the Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance, el Congreso, the South Asian Student Association, IDEAS, Queer Student Union, La Familia de Colores, Queer Commission, the Black Student Union Executive Board, Kapatirang Pilipino, the Society for Accessible and Safe Spaces, the Humyn Rights Board, the Arab Student Group and the Student Committee on Racial Equality. Not only are the voices of Palestinians silenced time and time again, but so are the voices of these students advocating for the rights of Palestinians in their fight against forced complicity in an occupation that has lasted 46-plus years.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, these divestment hearings have demonstrated how students of this university are preparing to enter the political arena, performing the roles of politicians and consolidating connections and allies rather than educating students or working to end injustices. To take advantage of an entire people’s struggle and co-opt a movement in order to create a non-existent ideological split, solely for the purpose of boosting one party’s platform, demonstrates the failure of U.S. students to utilize their education to “advance the wellbeing of our state, nation, and world,” as so eloquently put by our mission statement. Student leaders on this campus ignored their roles within this institution and pleaded with their peers to leave this conflict to world leaders; the very next morning Israel’s Prime Minister, “Bibi” Netanyahu, backed out of the peace talks. World leaders and institutions have been compliant in the occupation; the responsibility now falls on us as students, organizers and humans who all have the capability to empathize.</p>\n<p>Nonviolence has been heralded as the only true way to peace; however, as SJP put up this divestment resolution — which is part of the larger nonviolent “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions” movement — the consensus amongst anti-divestment organizers was that this was still an attack on Israel. “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions” was a call made by Palestinian civil society in 2005 and the movement has gained traction on a global scale with four UC’s passing divestment resolutions.</p>\n<p>Stokely Carmichael once said of Dr. Martin Luther King, “His major assumption was that if you are nonviolent, if you suffer, your opponent will see your suffering and will be moved to change his heart. That’s very good. He only made one fallacious assumption: In order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience.” In reality, Israel, the United States, the corporations profiting off this occupation and this Associated Students Senate have no conscience.</p>\n<p>We cannot ignore the fact that the United States sends Israel eight million dollars a day in military aid, regardless of countless resolutions condemning Israel’s human rights violations. We cannot forget that Palestine has been colonized and that Palestinians are indigenous to Israel and Palestine, including Jewish, Muslim and Christian Palestinians. We are profiting off of <em>companies</em> that demolish homes to make room for settlements. There are over four million registered Palestinian refugees. This movement is bigger than UCSB, and it is reaching a pivotal moment.</p>\n<p>We can no longer be invested in violence, and just as truth and justice has prevailed in the past, so will it at the University of California.

The two are fundamentally linked together — and this is a problem. While the majority of acts of sexual violence are committed against women, by framing the issue in this way we are limiting the diversity of issues of sexual violence we address.</p>\n<p>Sexual violence does not discriminate, and we need to stop treating the issue as if it does. Once we acknowledge that this issue affects everyone we can begin working together to find a solution. We must stop focusing on educating women on how to avoid rape and start focusing on educating the population on how to prevent rape. Bringing everyone in on this issue will allow survivors to break their silence, stop the victim blaming and correct the distorted views on sexual violence we see today, thus allowing us to start focusing on the real problem.</p>\n<p>Today a girl gets told that her clothes, the fact that she was drunk, her actions, etc. are the reason she was raped. We are told constantly that we need to stop victim blaming, so much so that it feels uncertain that it actually happens, but it does. We know better. Who cares what she was wearing or doing? Rape can never be justified, under any circumstances. Period. There are certain things that can undeniably put you at a greater risk for being sexually assaulted, yes, but that shouldn’t be what we focus on. We should be focusing on the rapist, because regardless of the circumstances, that’s the real problem. And then, in the rare circumstance that these events do get publicized and the victims don’t get blamed, we preach how horrible the rapist is and ask how could anyone ever do that, without ever truly asking ourselves just that question: how could anyone ever do that? What leads a person to commit such a heinous crime?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We have to start asking and answering that question, and not just by looking at the person, but the greater social problem. We have to answer that question by looking at ourselves. How are we perpetuating sexual violence? How are we allowing this person to think that raping someone is okay? Look at the media, look at day-to-day speech, look at your own reactions when you hear of an act of sexual violence, and then ask what is wrong with these things. We have to come together and answer this question. And we have to come together as not just women, but as men, women and everyone in between. Because it’s not just women. Women are not the only victims, and men are not the only perpetrators. Forget the numbers and address the issue. Just because only 3 percent of men get raped compared to 15 percent of women doesn’t mean we should forget about those men who have been raped. Sexual violence is such a taboo subject that those numbers are probably skewed anyway.</p>\n<p>I say this as a feminist and survivor myself. I do not want to undermine the importance of women’s rights, but rather highlight that we need to open our minds beyond seeing sexual violence through merely one lens. Yes, the objectification of women perpetrates sexual violence and that must be stopped, but women are not the only ones affected by sexual violence and we need to start appreciating that fact and understand that women alone cannot end this.</p>\n<p>Stop blaming the victim. Stop using the rapist as a scapegoat. Stop forgetting about the non-female survivors. Stop ignoring the problem. Let’s start talking. Let’s start taking responsibility for the part we play in this. Let’s all take a stand against sexual violence and stop tolerating it in our community, regardless of our personal experiences with it. Sexual violence is a sickness that has infected our community and it is our duty to cure it. So let’s stop avoiding the real issue and come together to face it.</p>\n<p>Emily Potter thinks we should fix it. So fix it!</p>\n<h6>This is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>The views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

The author makes an assertion that Hinduism is a polytheistic religion (as part of an argument that the columnists of the “Ask An Atheist” column are not targeting all kinds of religion). As a Hindu I would like to state that this is not entirely correct.  The Vedas, which are the religious texts of the Hindus, mention in several different verses that all gods are but a manifestation (or avataars) of the one supreme being.</p>\n<p>To quote from a great book about Hinduism: “Hindus have one God. They also have 330 million gods: male gods, female gods, personal gods, family gods, household gods, village gods, gods of space and time, gods for specific castes and particular professions, gods who reside in trees, in animals, in minerals, in geometrical patterns and in man-made objects. Then there are a whole host of demons. But no Devil.” — Myth = Mithya, Devdutt Pattanaik.</p>\n<p>Hinduism is accommodating of many different belief systems, and therefore one will find many different beliefs expressed by different people, all of whom will claim to be Hindus. This is in stark contrast to Judeo-Islamic systems which have fewer holy texts and a more hierarchical system.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That being said, I agree that “Ask An Atheist” could broaden its horizons to include other religions; however, I believe the point of that column is to express the viewpoints of atheists rather than just repudiate the viewpoints of different religions. On the whole, I think the inclusion of “Ask An Atheist” was a great idea because it is the beginning of a discussion. It is important that every faith gives its followers the leeway to ask questions and let them freely make a choice to believe (or not). I have found the column thought-provoking, and it’s helped me understand different belief systems better. I hope it is something that will continue for a while.</p>\n<p>Rajlakshmi Purkayastha is a graduate student of metallurgical engineering and materials science.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-20/truisms-hinduism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-20/truisms-hinduism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-20/truisms-hinduism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-20/truisms-hinduism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-20/truisms-hinduism/","id":6115,"author":{"id":546,"name":"Rajlakshmi Purkayastha"},"related":[6114,6113,6112],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
