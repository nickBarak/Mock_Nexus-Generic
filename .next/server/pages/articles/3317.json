No player, no matter the sport, can keep on playing forever. This harsh reality sets in for everyone at some point whether you’re the best player of all time or simply a cog in the machinery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was hard to see Michael Jordan go, and it was hard to see Kobe Bryant go. And now, unfortunately, we say goodbye to the great Tim Duncan who has decided to retire from the NBA at the age of 40.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

We all know the greatness of Duncan. We know about the five rings, three Finals MVPs, 15 all-star appearances, two league MVP awards and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of such a decorated and honored career most people, including myself, can also come to the conclusion that Duncan is the greatest power forward to ever live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He was the star of a team that, for 19 years, displayed constant greatness year in and year out. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spurs never missed a playoff series during his 19-year career and have maintained a winning percentage never less than .610. Duncan is also only one of two players in NBA history to win an NBA title in three different decades (the ’90s, ’00s, ’10s).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Duncan a true superstar is the fact that he never acted like or was treated like one. He never caused controversy — except for when it came to his disdain over his favorite referee, Joey Crawford — and never wanted to be in the spotlight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duncan wasn’t “sexy” like these other superstars. I mean, seriously, what’s sexy about the nickname “The Big Fundamental.” It’s no “King James” and it certainly is no “Black Mamba,” but it’s representative of him, and that’s what makes it special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was only one thing he cared about: winning. And in this day and age in which loyalty has become overrated and players are constantly seeking a bigger market to expand their brand, it’s refreshing to know that there was a player who truly looked beyond superficiality and simply wanted to play the sport he loves with his beloved teammates, coaches, and city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Kobe Bryant had to make his exit from the NBA known to the world by jacking up 50 shots and scoring 60 points — that’s why we love you, Kobe — it was fitting that Duncan’s way of leaving was to make a quiet exit toward stage right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Clipper fan, I know Duncan will always have a special place in my heart, seeing as how he constantly used to rip it out in the pre-Chris Paul days. From 2003-2010, the Spurs and The Big Fundamental beat the Clippers in 26 of 27 match-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ups including an 18-game winning streak from 2006-2010.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard being a Clipper fan — trust me, I can attest — but it’s only made harder when there’s one team and one guy in particular who continually beat your team quite handily.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71892\" style=\"width: 287px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71892\" data-attachment-id=\"71892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-12/farewell-to-a-big-fundamental/29906170001_3624585928001_screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"539,374\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=277%2C192\" alt=\"Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of Associated Press\" width=\"277\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?w=539&amp;ssl=1 539w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of <em>Associated Press</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why when the Clippers beat the Spurs in that playoff series in 2015 and Chris Paul made that game-winning shot in game seven over Duncan, my life as an NBA fan was, in a way, complete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know it’s not the same as winning a championship — and believe me, the next round is still painful to talk about to this day — but finally seeing the team I love to get over the hump against the team I despised most was truly satisfying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My hate for Duncan was simply out of respect for the man and his craft. I hated that he wasn’t a Clipper, winning all those games and championships for us, but I loved the man he was on the court and respected the man off of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching Duncan lose that series against the Clippers was like seeing my favorite cartoon hero defeat his enemy for the first time. And yet, watching Duncan retire is like watching the final episode of that cartoon; it really feels like my childhood is over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess that’s why No. 21’s decision to retire really gets me at an emotional level. But as the other constantly heard cliché goes, all good things must come to an end. Just like every great player that has walked away from the game during my lifetime, I’ll get over it.

morning, when his charges were dropped to two misdemeanor charges of stalking and vandalism. </span><em>Sophia Lovell / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third-year student, Dante Linden, is suspended indefinitely until a Title IX investigation is completed, according to Alexis — the student that reported that Linden was stalking her, who the Nexus is referring to with her first name only to protect her privacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she was informed about his suspension by the Office of Student Conduct. When asked about Linden’s status as a student, university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the university was “prohibited by law and policy from discussing the specifics of this case.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall 2019 was Linden’s first quarter at UCSB, according to student verification records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linden was being held on a $150,000 bail at the Santa Barbara County Jail until his arraignment on Tuesday morning, when his charges were dropped to two misdemeanor charges of stalking and vandalism. His bail was also reduced to $2,500, which he posted, and he was subsequently released Tuesday evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judicial officer in the case, Judge Clifford R. Anderson III, made Linden’s bail contingent on his compliance with a criminal protective order that was filed the same day, which orders Linden not to contact or come within 150 yards of Alexis. Alexis said she also requested a no-contact order through the Office of Student Conduct on campus on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Alexis said she first met Linden on Tinder at the beginning of the school year and “hooked up” with him approximately three times over the course of a week and a half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t think it was a big deal, and [he] wasn’t even the only person I was seeing or anything like that,” she said. “After that, he was just kind of weird, and not really my type … so I just cut him off, like I just ghosted him, like you do in that situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when Linden’s behavior became unstable, and he began to send her threatening and vulgar messages, Alexis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d be like, ‘Fuck you, you’re with another guy’ or something. And I was just like, okay, [I] blocked [him] on Snapchat, like that’s easy,” she said. “And then … he was on my Instagram, saying, ‘Why did you block me?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After blocking Linden on multiple platforms, Alexis said he then began texting her, asking her to come over, what she was doing and if he could come over to her place, she said. Initially, Alexis didn’t respond, but said she eventually told Linden: “Dude, I don’t feel the same way about you; I’m talking to someone else so, yeah, leave me alone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though she later blocked him on iMessage, Alexis said the block didn’t transfer over to her laptop, where he continued to harass her.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He sent me … like 25 texts, [a] message poem thing saying, ‘I like the way your eyes moved.’ Like ‘Oh my dear Alexis.’ Like really weird stuff,” she said. “This Friday, I was talking to my friend on FaceTime and I get this random FaceTime call …  and I answer it and it’s him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she immediately ended the call, but Linden kept calling and texting her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that point I was like, stop talking to me, you’re stalking me, I’m going to report it. And he was like, ‘Alright, do it, I don’t care. Tell the feds, I don’t care,’ just kind of making a joke about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that night, while Alexis was out of town, Linden allegedly came to her room in San Rafael Hall and starting loudly knocking on her suite’s door at around midnight, according to her roommates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had [either] cut himself prior — or was cutting himself then — and wrote his name in blood on my door,” Alexis said. “And then he was scratching his nails in my door, like his name and then my name.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, Alexis’ roommates found her name and his name written on the door together in a red substance that looked like blood; Alexis provided the Nexus with a picture of the door.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They sent me a picture ‘cause I was [out of town],” Alexis said. “I saw it and I automatically had a panic attack, like I was freaking out, I was shaking, I was crying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minutes after hearing what Linden had done, Alexis made a phone call to the UCSB Police Department to report what had happened. Linden was subsequently arrested with a warrant the next afternoon near the Santa Ynez apartments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis also spoke to a San Rafael resident assistant, Dallana Jimenez, who advised her through the next steps. Jimenez also reported the incident to San Rafael Assistant Resident Director Jesse Rodriguez, who later informed Alexis in an email that he had filed a Clery Act report and Title IX report, “as is required of [his] job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to a question about why the university had not sent out an alert to the student body when notified of the incident, Estrada said in an email that “</span><b>Timely Warnings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are issued when certain crimes (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-crime-definitions.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Crime Definitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) that occurred on UCSB-associated property (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-geography.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Geography</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) are considered a serious or continuing threat to the campus community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The decision to issue a Timely Warning is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the facts surrounding the Clery Act crime, including, but not limited to, such factors as: the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” Estrada said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days following Linden’s arrest, Alexis consulted the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E) to learn more about the resources and services available to her in dealing with the aftermath of experiencing a stalker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she also consulted with Victims Advocates in the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office, who aided her in working out the legal end of her situation. She also said the university had offered to move her into a different dorm, but that she declined the offer, telling the Nexus that it “doesn’t do anything — if he wanted to find me, he could.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis, who said she “almost didn’t go to the C.A.R.E office,” walked in after those close to her helped change her mind; she was immediately connected with an advocate to help talk her through her situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following her appointment, Alexis said her advocate was “super helpful,” encouraging her to explore all possible options and recommending that she take her situation to the attention of the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[C.A.R.E. staff] were all really, really friendly. [My advocate] was really helpful with me. She’s helping me get an attorney [and] do this whole process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When consulting survivors involved in situations involving legal matters, C.A.R.E assumes the role of a “liaison,” providing them with the support to take their situation to the police or Title IX through “informed decisions” facilitated by C.A.R.E, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The criminal justice system is really complicated … [and] the campus reporting system is pretty complicated,” which makes dealing with harassment and stalking particularly difficult, Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major function of our role is that liaison role, especially around following up from these entities to get updates: ‘So what’s the status of this person’s case? What are the next steps? When can they expect to hear from you again?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s really where our expertise and understanding of trauma comes into play and being able to understand how processes … re-victimize and can re-traumatize. So sometimes C.A.R.E’s role is to promote and help things happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E operates on the basis of “services,” which Conway defines as “any interaction between a client and an advocate.” A service could be as simple as a short meeting, Conway said, or more extensive — such as going to accompany a survivor for “restraining order paperwork” or an interview at the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In respects to stalking, Conway said the “threat of fear” is a lot more common in survivors, especially in situations involving a high “volume” of harassment, which can be difficult to shake off when “peace and security” is all they want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The elements that make stalking stick out a little bit differently than the other forms of violence that we serve is around the electronic component of it,” Conway said. “All they want is the behavior to stop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the pervasiveness of stalking through texting and social media, Conway said that it’s easy for people to feel violated when stalkers find a way to circumvent their boundaries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My whole family is obviously freaking the fuck out,” Alexis said. “I called my mom crying, like, can you imagine, can you imagine?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you imagine your daughter calling you, telling you [that] someone wrote in blood on her door? Like a stalker? It’s crazy,” she said. “[My parents] were really scared, and they kind of want me to come home and it’s crazy that that’s even an option, like that’s what I have to do [to feel safe], go home.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

[Tuesday’s] report by the NCAA Committee on Infractions is the result of an investigation that was conducted cooperatively by the NCAA enforcement staff and the university,” Bill Mahoney, associate athletics director of communications, said in a statement on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Barbara is disappointed that the violations happened. The University is committed to learning from the process and continuing to promote student-athlete welfare and competition with integrity as core values of the university’s athletics department.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the track program, a former head coach, who was with the program for over 30 years and is not named in the decision, was found to have violated restrictions on “countable athletically related activities,” otherwise known as CARA. The only head coach who was with UCSB during this time was the former Head Coach Pete Dolan, according to UCSB’s website. Dolan was fired from the position in June 2018 and later filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the decision, the head coach expected student athletes to “log their training activity” during “summer months outside of the playing season and the required weekly day off during the season</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hich is prohibited under NCAA rules, according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He actively monitored these logs, provided feedback on the student-athletes’ training, and in some instances admonished or otherwise disciplined student-athletes who did not complete their logs,” the decision states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the head coach was actively involved in the logs, and the training activity was “not initiated or requested solely by the student-athletes,” the NCAA considered his activities “impermissible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the men’s water polo team, the head water polo coach “impermissibly facilitated housing for one of the student-athletes who wanted to come to Santa Barbara prior to his enrollment and compete on a local water polo club team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach during that time was Wolf Wigo, who is currently employed by the university, according to UCSB’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NCAA committee found that this led to other restricted recruiting inducements, including free meals and transportation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach were found to have improperly compensated two international student-athletes, who are not named in the decision, with “a monthly stipend that equaled the exact amount of their rent and transferred the payment directly to the student-athletes’ landlord.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two student-athletes were employed at a water polo club co-owned by the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach, and were paid “significantly higher” rates compared to the hourly rates of other student-athletes working in similar positions at the club, according to the decision. The two student-athletes were also found to have been occasionally paid for “work not actually performed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Tuesday’s decision, the head track coach involved is now subject to a one-year show-cause order, which follows him to any NCAA institution that he may be employed by or affiliated with between Nov. 5, 2019 and Nov. 4, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Should the head track coach become employed in an athletically related position at an NCAA member institution during the one-year show-cause period, the head track coach shall be suspended from 30 percent of the season’s contests,” the decision writes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the NCAA decision, the head and assistant water polo coaches are subject to two-year and one-year show-cause orders respectively, which prohibit them from a number of coaching duties during their show-cause order time periods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach, who was found to be “personally involved in arranging a recruiting inducement and providing extra benefits in the form of improper compensation and pay for work not performed,” is prohibited from all off-campus recruiting activities during this two-year period, which is applied to any NCAA-affiliated institution that they may be employed by during the period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head coach is also suspended from the first 30% of the season’s contests during the first year of the show-cause period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The provisions of this suspension require that the head water polo coach not be present in the facility where contests are held and have no contact or communication with men’s water polo coaching staff members or student-athletes during the suspension dates,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The prohibition includes all coaching activities for the period of time that begins at 12:01 a.m. on the day of the contest and ends at 11:59 p.m. that day. During that period, the head coach may not participate in any coaching activities, including, but not limited to, team travel, practice, video study, recruiting and team meetings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the results of any contests during this suspension will not count for the head coach’s coaching record.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the assistant water polo coach’s show-cause period, they are to be suspended from 30% of the season’s contests, a suspension that will be served after the head water polo coach’s  suspension from the first 30% of the contests is served. The provisions of the assistant coach’s show-cause period are the same as the head coach’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the penalties on the coaches, UCSB is placed on probation for two years, beginning Nov. 5, 2019, and ending Nov. 4, 2021, and is required to pay a fine of $5,000 “plus one percent of each of the budgets for the men’s water polo, men’s cross country and women’s cross country programs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track and men’s water polo programs are also required to put limitations on their recruiting visits and reduce the scholarships they give out, based on previous self-imposed restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of the penalties listed in the decision are self-imposed, including the men’s water polo team abstaining from participating in post-season conference and NCAA tournament competition during the 2018 season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since two student-athletes involved in the water polo program violations are now considered ineligible, UCSB is required to vacate all “regular season and conference tournament records and participation in which the two ineligible student-athletes competed from the time they became ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Further, UCSB’s records regarding its men’s water polo program, as well as the records of the head men’s water polo coach, shall reflect the vacated records,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the other self-imposed restrictions, which occurred while the NCAA investigation was occuring, included the men’s water polo coaching staff being barred from recruiting communication with prospective international student-athletes from April 1, 2018, through Dec. 31, 2018, other than the student-athletes who had already verbally committed to or been signed by UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with the track program, “UCSB reduced CARA by four hours per week for cross country student-athletes and track and field student-athletes who are also on the cross country squad list.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also required track program athletes to take two days off per week from CARA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During UCSB’s probation period, the university is required to “develop and implement a comprehensive educational program on NCAA legislation to instruct coaches, the faculty athletics representative, all athletics department personnel and all institutional staff members with responsibility for recruiting and certification legislation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, they must submit a report to the NCAA committee by Jan. 15, 2020, informing them of their implementation plan and schedule. They must also file annual compliance reports by Aug. 30 of each year of probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Particular emphasis shall be placed on rules education and monitoring related to CARA and student-athlete employment,” according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All student-athletes prospects must also be informed of UCSB’s probation status, and UCSB must “publicize specific and understandable information” about the infractions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once UCSB submits its final compliance report, and before the probation period is concluded, Chancellor Yang must also send a letter to the NCAA “affirming that UCSB’s current athletics policies and practices conform to all requirements of NCAA regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omar Hernandez contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
