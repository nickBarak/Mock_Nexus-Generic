This will be their sophomore album, and their first didn’t quite live up to their mixtapes. You can blame stale production and verses that didn’t know when to end themselves. “Headstone,” though, has a syncopated but catchy beat, and every member loses his mind in verses cleverly riddled with references to hip-hop greats.</span></p>\n<p><b>Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Sex &amp; Food: April 6</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruban Nielson’s brainchild will follow up their critically-acclaimed 2015 effort Multi-Love with Sex &amp; Food, and its singles promise plenty of psychedelically doctored guitars, drums, vocals and whatever else the band has lying around. In “Not in Love We’re Just High,” Nielson pretty much uses his voice as a synth, and he weaves it hypnotically through a bobbing core melody. “American Guilt,” however, is a fuzzy, driving expression of paranoia, flying on the back of a distorted hard rock riff. Here’s to hoping the rest of the songs deliver on the visceral tone that the album’s title implies and these songs promise.</span></p>\n<p><b>Thirty Seconds to Mars, America: April 6</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Seconds to Mars decided to come back, and this time they’re not even pretending to be a rock band. Well, kinda. Singles “Walk on Water” and “Dangerous Night” sound like Imagine Dragons meets Ed Sheeran meets top-40 default sound boards meets Jared Leto’s singing voice. </span></p>\n<p><b>John Prine, The Tree of Forgiveness: April 13</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Country legend and restless human John Prine is set to release his 24th studio album. It’s been thirteen years since he’s released an album of all new material, and The Tree of Forgiveness’s singles show that time has been on Prine’s mind. In “Summer’s End,” time moves faster than anyone’s prepared for, and moments are lost before you’ve thought about them. And “Knockin’ on Your Screen Door” is a springy ode to old-man loneliness. And even though there’s a bit of summer breeze in their sound, Prine is sounding as timeless as he ever has on these singles, and this album looks as if it will maintain his reputation as a songwriter with a golden pen.</span></p>\n<p><b>A Perfect Circle, Eat the Elephant: April 20</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been 14 years since the heavy rock supergroup last unleashed an album’s worth of layered and animalistic darkness onto the world, and now it’s finally time for more. Two of the singles that are already out — “The Doomed” and “TalkTalk” — came with videos that take on an eerie and confrontational tone. “TalkTalk” is a spiritual criticism and a challenge to back up words with actions, and its music video features — lying in the hands of the most unnaturally pale of men — a palpitating heart/space-octopus. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>Janelle Monáe, Dirty Computer: April 27</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next manifestation of Janelle Monáe’s monstrous ambition comes attached with a film project to enrich the narrative. Monáe’s conceptual streak seems like it will hit a high mark this April. She released two crazy singles along with their music videos late last January. “Make Me Feel” is a groovy bit of dance pop that reinvents the sounds of Prince, and it reeks of just as much sex and glitter. (Monáe has stated that Prince actually worked on the project with her before his passing in 2016). “Django Jane,” on the other hand, is all filthy bars and disdain. Janelle Monáe is beyond crushing the competition at this point.</span></p>\n<p><b>Courtney Barnett, Tell Me How You Really Feel: May 18</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following up her collaborative album with Kurt Vile that came out last year, Courtney Barnett is set to release her second solo studio album this May. Lead single “Nameless, Faceless” sports more biting lyrics and louder guitars than is usual for Barnett. The chorus goes “I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Men are scared that women will laugh at them / I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Women are scared that men will kill them.” And with song titles like “I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch” and “Crippling Self Doubt and a General Lack of Self Confidence,” who’s not curious about this album?</span></p>\n<p><b>Parquet Courts, Wide Awake!: May 18</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The singles from this album are more than punk with a groove; they’re punk that makes you want to move in platform shoes. That goes very well with lyrics like “All this music’s playin’ in my head / If it stops I’m / If it stops I’m / If it stops I’m having an unshakeable nightmare” from the latter half of “Almost Had to Start a Fight / In and Out of Patience.” Parquet Courts is having a lot of fun on this album, and that’s always a good sign. Punkers who don’t have fun, well, they’re just boring.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

The singer-songwriter, known mononymously as Mitski, released her fifth studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">via Dead Oceans on August 17 to seemingly unanimous critical acclaim. In an album so aesthetically different from her prior works, Mitski proves that she does not need to lean on her lo-fi indie rock niche, as she breaks out of her classic use of vocal overlays and grainy tracks as heard on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Puberty 2 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bury Me At Makeout Point</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitski is one of the rare artists who can articulate feelings so complex, that trying to formulate the words to describe them usually seems futile. She isn’t afraid to broadcast emotions and desires that seem ugly or taboo because she knows everybody else feels them, too. That’s what makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such a standout: Every relationship is unique, but the corresponding feelings remain universal, and Mitski chooses to lean into the discomfort with an unflinching candor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Geyser,” is one of Mitski’s more cohesive songs with her previous work. The album begins with a hazy intro and the yearning lyrics, “You’re my number one / You’re the one I want / And you’ve turned down / Every hand that has beckoned me to come.” Unlike many of her other tracks, Mitski admitted in an interview with NPR that “Geyser” breaks from her traditional use of narrative and instead is “all feeling.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may seem to reference a lover, Mitski sings of her relationship with music and her career. Being an artist has led to her sacrifice of her physical and mental health and her relationships with other people. She skillfully personifies music as a partner, thus allowing “Geyser” to remain wholly relatable, even for those who are not so musically inclined. She ends the song with the woeful, “I will be the one you need / I just can’t be without you,” which is indicative of any passionate — maybe even unhealthy — relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second song on the album, “Why Didn’t You Stop Me?” portrays a self-centered desire for an ex. In this narrative Mitski finds herself feeling regretful after ending things with her partner. “I know I ended it, but / Why won’t you chase after me?” she asks. As the song continues it becomes clear that Mitski has a distorted perception of her partner and the relationship they had together, as she sings, “I look for a picture of you / To keep in my pocket / But I can’t seem to find one / Where you look how I remember / Look how I remember.” It seems incredibly bold for an artist to shed light on a relationship in a way that lacks a whimsical and nostalgic element. While the music may retain these undertones, the lyrics tell a different story of warped ideas of other people and even of ourselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most relatable track on the entire album, Mitski delves into the sentiment behind trying to settle the score with an ex on “Lonesome Love.” She sings of putting on makeup and high heels to prove to her ex that she has moved on and is thriving, but upon seeing them immediately softens and completely loses the upper hand. The melody shifts from an upbeat acoustic guitar to a more solemn tone as she mournfully sings, “‘Cause nobody butters me up like you / And nobody fucks me like me.” Mitski manages to completely gut her listeners (and all in under two minutes) as she relays a story that may feel all too familiar to many. She ends the song on a solemn note: “Why am I lonely for lonesome love? / Why am I lonely?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to her incredible vocals, Mitski is also a profound lyricist. She shows off some of her best songwriting chops on album-standout “Nobody.” Juxtaposed with the upbeat music, the strikingly sad lyrics once again touch on feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. Possibly the most insightful verse on the entire album, Mitski compares her own desires to the greenhouse gases on the planet Venus: “Venus, planet of love / Was destroyed by global warming / Did its people want too much too? / Did its people want too much?” Breaking from the abstract she goes onto sing, “And I don’t want your pity / I just want somebody near me.” On this particular verse, Mitski explained that she views pity as the “emotion you have for someone who’s, like, lower than you. I don’t want your fucking pity…Don’t judge me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so much available content about relationships and all that comes with them, Mitski still finds a way to offer a refreshing take. The album is so densely packed with hits that touching on all of them would simply be too lofty an effort. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proves to be Mitski’s magnum opus. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Following this song were a couple others like “We Don’t Care,” “Sweet Dreams,” “Faded Heart” and finally the song that put him on the map: “Electric Love.” It was during this song that he picked up the guitar once again and invited the audience to sing the beginning harmonies along with him.</p>\n<p>While the headliners of this show were alt-J, it was quite clear that this crowd would now be leaving the SB Bowl with a new appreciation for the music, style and stage presence of a very Mick-Jagger-esque Børns.</p>\n<p>Although it was obvious that an alt-J concert would attract all the local hipsters here in Santa Barbara, it was quite interesting to see the diversity in the age of audience members. This further reinforces the likeability of alt-J, as they’re able to appeal to almost anyone — Glenn Howerton, better known as Dennis on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” was even there showing his support and admiration for the band as a fellow civilian concertgoer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82530\" style=\"width: 1810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"620383098\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82528\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82530\" data-attachment-id=\"82530\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/alt-j-and-borns-breeze-through-santa-barbara-bowl/unnamed-54/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82530\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Beginning their lively set with “Deadcrush” off their newest studio album <em>Relaxer</em>, alt-J presented their fans with a very visually stunning stage setup and light show. From left to right was Gus Unger-Hamilton on keyboard, Joe Newman on guitar and vocals and Thom Sonny Green on drums, with each member divided by an open-knit curtain of lights that synchronized with the band’s music. Additionally, behind them was a giant lit-up triangle that the band uses as a logo since it comes from the Greek letter “delta” and represents change.</p>\n<p>Everywhere, fans were either jumping out of their seats and belting out each word to each song or happily relaxing while they bobbed their heads along to the contagious melodies. New songs like “In Cold Blood” and “Pleader” seemed to capture and maintain the attention of the crowd; however, it was incomparable to the change in audience hype when alt-J performed fan favorites like “Fitzpleasure,” “Tesselate” and “Matilda.” It was during these songs in particular that sober and drunk fans alike were able to come together and truly express their love for the music as one coherent entity.</p>\n<p>In an effort to wrap things up, alt-J ended their set with “Left Hand Free,” which has been played almost everywhere since its release and has since been featured in major motion picture films like “Captain America: Civil War.” This was the one that got each audience member up off their feet as they were enticed to sing along to the band’s biggest hit. All too soon though, the stage went from flickering purple and white lights to pure darkness, and everyone was left waiting in anticipation for an encore.</p>\n<p>In the end, the boys of alt-J came back out to perform an additional three songs for their eager and beloved fans, and the show concluded with the song that made them famous to begin with: “Breezeblocks.” After a night of playing a medley of old and new songs, it was rather refreshing to see alt-J go back to their roots and give thanks to the many that have helped them achieve this level of success. If you happened to miss this spectacular show here at the Santa Barbara Bowl, both alt-J and Børns, will be playing at Weekend 2 of Coachella –– so go catch them if you can.</p><div

music and produced creative tracks that proves his growing originality. On the six-track, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weeknd continues to innovate while producing numbing, cathartic post-break-up music that reflects a new style of R&amp;B.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye, began his musical journey in 2011 with his mixtape </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House of Balloons </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and since then, has broken numerous boundaries within the R&amp;B genre. While categorized as an R&amp;B and pop singer, he managed to create his own niche with a slower, darker, and sensual version of the styles, while attaching his soulful, smooth voice to the sounds. Even though it’s been labeled reminiscent of Michael Jackson’s style, The Weeknd’s high pitch smooth tone defies traditional pop music. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is centered around a very somber theme, which is indicated by the title itself. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Similarly, closing song “Privilege” sounds like it was pulled straight from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trilogy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with soft vocals and lyrics that are simultaneously sensual and painful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This track seems to be his attempt at creating peace within himself, as he even says “let’s try to end it with a smile.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work as a whole seems to reflect his inner quarrel between grief and love, as he finally settles with his emotions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weeknd’s most recent albums, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiss Land, Starboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beauty Behind the Madness, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deviate from his original music, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seems to combine the many different sounds of these albums</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project is consistent with the Weeknd’s original introspectiveness, and also brings back the original Abel that fans loved. Maybe </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Dear Melancholy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is The Weeknd’s attempt at returning to his most loved </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trilogy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">production, or maybe he’s moving toward a new direction that continues to combine pop, alternative rock, and R&amp;B — only the next album will tell. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82440\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/the-friday-review-my-dear-melancholy-by-the-weeknd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82440\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/the-friday-review-my-dear-melancholy-by-the-weeknd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/the-friday-review-my-dear-melancholy-by-the-weeknd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/the-friday-review-my-dear-melancholy-by-the-weeknd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/the-friday-review-my-dear-melancholy-by-the-weeknd/","id":6656,"author":{"id":661,"name":"Neha Makkapati"},"related":[6655,6654,6653],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
