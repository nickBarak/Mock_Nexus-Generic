Last October, law enforcement personnel assigned to work Halloween weekend in I.V. included UCPD officers from UCSB and other UC campuses, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office deputies, California Highway Patrol and Ventura County Sheriff’s Office, as well investigators from local law enforcement agencies and the Sheriff’s Mounted unit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said a noise ordinance will be in effect beginning at 6 p.m. during Halloween weekend, largely due to the behavior of out of town visitors who come to I.V. to celebrate the holiday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s more reactionary to people who are from out of town walking in public making noise or resident’s blasting music towards the street than it is to private house parties,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said he hopes the number of people coming to I.V. for Halloween continues to decrease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Halloween and Deltopia have certainly died down in the recent years,” said Signa. “We would like to keep it that way for the safety of our neighbors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD Officer Jon Reyes said I.V. residents should take normal precautions to protect their residencies and vehicles over Halloween weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lock your house and car doors,” Reyes said. “Secure your belongings. We deal with a lot of preventable burglaries.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College of Letters and Science Senator and third-year history of public policy major  Ashcon Minoiefar helped organize the event and said Pizza with Police has been very successful. UCPD and A.S. will be hosting the event every other week in October with a follow-up event after Halloween, according to Minoiefar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pizza with Police went very well,” Minoiefar said in an email. “Since Lt. Mark Signa and I started the event last Halloween, it has consistently brought in 100-200 attendees every time.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minoiefar said Pizza with Police “gets students interested” in public safety and could encourage them to volunteer for community policing programs such as UCIV which is active during Halloween and Deltopia weekends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating a culture of community policing and community involvement in public safety, is the first step to moving away from harsh enforcement and high rates of tickets,” Minoiefar said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biology major Manu Chopra said his interactions with officers at the event caused him to see them, specifically Reyes, as more that “just a police officer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just hearing his stories of past experiences on the force humanized him,” Chopra said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65027\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65027\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/pizza-with-police-focuses-on-i-v-halloween-plans/","id":3939,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3938,3937,3936],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez","biography":"Not available","articles":[2516,2571,2611,2670,2679,2694,3939,3962,3971,3974,3975,3976,3977],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up 5/7-5/10","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sbso_masthead_office_new_012.jpg?resize=355%2C192&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sbso_masthead_office_new_012.jpg?resize=769%2C192&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to one case of public intoxication, one break-in, two fights, one peeping tom and one vehicle theft last weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to one case of public intoxication, one break-in, two fights, one peeping tom and one vehicle theft last weekend.</p>\n<p>Thursday night, a 7-Eleven employee reported a subject urinating in an aisle. Upon entering the store IVFP deputies saw the subject, later identified as 19-year-old UCSB student Peter Alan Deleon, mopping the floor. After questioning Deleon, deputies arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Friday night, deputies responded to a break-in on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. Residents who witnessed the break-in said the suspect, identified as Atascadero resident Zachary Devries, jumped onto a car, then fell to the ground near the residency and became violent when asked if he was okay. He punched two subjects and proceeded to break into the residency by shattering a glass door. Residents then beat Devries in self-defense until he became unconscious. He was then transported to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Friday night deputies also responded to a report of a fight in front of Aladdin Café at 938 Embarcadero Del Norte. Witnesses said a subject, identified as 19-year-old Goleta resident Santiago Carmona, punched an employee of the restaurant. The employee, who stated Carmona hit him in the jaw, requested prosecution and signed a citizen’s arrest form. Carmona was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive noticed a male adult looking in windows of an apartment complex at 6653. After speaking with the subject, later identified as Carnell Lewis, deputies found he had no connection to the building. Lewis threatened the deputies and refused to comply with their instructions. He was then arrested on numerous charges and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Saturday night, deputies responded to a report of a fight on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. Deputies arrived and found approximately 40 people shouting obscenities at each other. Two subjects, identified as Jefferson Crockett and Campbell Davis, were arrested for breaking a victim’s jaw.</p>\n<p>Sunday, deputies responded to a report of a vehicle theft on the intersection of Camino del Sur and Sueño Road. The victim said a back window of his parked SUV had been broken and $1,200 had been stolen from a safe in the vehicle. Anyone with information related to the case is encouraged to notify IVFP.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/weekend-wrap-up-57-510/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/weekend-wrap-up-57-510/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/weekend-wrap-up-57-510/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/weekend-wrap-up-57-510/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/weekend-wrap-up-57-510/","id":3936,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3935,3934,3933],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last week (Oct. 5-12) law enforcement units in Isla Vista encountered a possible sexual assault, a driver under the influence of heroin and a suspect in possession of cocaine, marijuana and stolen wal...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>*This story has been updated as of 11:30 AM 10/14/15 to exclude a segment describing the death of a UCSB student.

The car was in drive and running on Embarcadero Road headed towards Del Playa Road. Officers administered a DUI investigation and found the driver had a BAC of .01 percent, with a background check later revealing Jordan as a heroin addict. Jordan admitted to being under the influence of heroin, later confirmed through a urine sample. Deputies also located heroin paraphernalia in his vehicle. Jordan was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail and his vehicle was towed and stored with Loves Towing.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 6, two I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were walking near Anisq’ Oyo’ Park and recognized Say’Qwaun Ford, a suspect whom they had seen in recent warrant status. He was detained for a records check and with Ford’s consent, deputies searched his backpack. A small pouch of marijuana, a small amount of cocaine and a stolen wallet with multiple items belonging to different people were found. Ford said he found the wallet on the kitchen floor of a party he attended the night before and did not know how the cocaine ended up in his bag, but anticipated his fingerprints would most likely be on it. He admitted to owning the marijuana. Ford, who had a previous history of providing a false identity and burglary, was arrested for theft and possession of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>On the night of Friday, Oct. 9, at approximately 12:46 a.m., law enforcement officers attempted to stop and detain a male suspect on suspicion of an alcohol possession violation. The suspect fled from the officers, drawing attention from other law enforcement officials in the area who ran to assist. One of the assisting officers collided with the suspect, causing him to slam into a parked car and slide to the pavement. Deputies then converged on the suspect as medical assistance made its way to the scene. Upon arrival, paramedics treated the suspect then took him to the hospital for further evaluation. The suspect fractured his left wrist and had several abrasions on his head, hands and knees. UCPD initiated a Use of Force review as a UCPD officer made contact with the suspect.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, an IVFP deputy witnessed a suspect, later identified as Dustin Anthony, strike a male victim in the head with a closed fist in the middle of Del Playa Road. The victim lost consciousness and hit his head on the concrete, causing him to seize and urinate in his pants. The victim was taken to the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital emergency room and Anthony was arrested at the scene and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, two male students were seen in broad daylight streaking around their residence at 6549 Cervantes. According to the students, they had lost a bet and had to run around the block naked. Two UCPD officers contacted the subjects and issued them citations for public nudity. Clothes were brought to the suspects by each of their parties while tickets were being issued.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65372\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65372\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/weekend-wrap-up-oct-5-12/","id":3937,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3936,3935,3934],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrapup May 21-25","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"This weekend, law enforcement responded to two incidents, a break-in and a robbery, in Isla Vista.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This weekend, law enforcement responded to two incidents, a break-in and a robbery, in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Last Thursday at around 2 a.m., I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were dispatched to a sorority house to investigate an audible alarm. Deputies arrived on scene and found a suspect, later identified as Brian Lopez Aranda, attempting to break in through the living room window. Lopez removed the window screen and triggered the alarm before deputies detained him. Aranda confessed to breaking into the residence because he was “lonely and curious about women.” Deputies arrested him for attempted residential burglary.</p>\n<p>Lopez waived his Miranda rights and informed deputies he entered the sorority house to try and see women. When asked what he would have done if he encountered a female in the residence, Lopez confessed he would have tried to touch her face. IVFP deputies added lewd and dissolute conduct in a public place to the burglary charges, and booked Lopez into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>The streets of I.V. remained quiet Saturday night.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, IVFP deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers responded to a report of a robbery at the 800 block of Camino del Sur.
