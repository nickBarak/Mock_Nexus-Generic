Soon after that, “Left Hand Free” came out, and this trio proved they were more than mere one-hit wonders; they were an alt (no pun intended) force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>Since their emergence into the world of music six years ago, alt-J has grown from a small college band in Leeds to an internationally known indie sensation admired by many. They reminded the people of Santa Barbara of this exact thing on Monday when they performed with special guest Børns at the SB Bowl for a night of fun, hipster bliss.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82529\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"299273983\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82528\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82529\" data-attachment-id=\"82529\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/alt-j-and-borns-breeze-through-santa-barbara-bowl/unnamed-1-19/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82529\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=800%2C1200\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82529\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Kicking things off right at 7:20 p.m. on the dot, singer-songwriter Garrett Borns jumped out from backstage and began with the first song of the night, “God Save Our Young Blood.” Sporting an monochromatic all-blue outfit, it was clear parallels were being made between the title of his newest album <em>Blue Madonna</em> and his interest in fashion as well. The unique and sophisticated style of Børns has even caught the eye of Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, who often supplies his wardrobe for major events like Coachella and music video shoots.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As people made their way to their seats, Børns continued dancing across the stage and singing his soft pop-rock hits, each with more fervor than the last. It was during this time that die-hard fans of his made themselves apparent, as they begun to spring from their seats and caper in both the seated and general admission sections. Because of the time limit on his set, Børns sped his way through the first two-thirds of his set list by cutting out certain verses and choruses to reserve time for his other better-known singles.</p>\n<p>Once he brought out the guitar for “10,000 Emerald Pools” and begun strumming, everyone around me seemed to raise their heads in recognition and finally allowed themselves to join the surrounding excitement. Following this song were a couple others like “We Don’t Care,” “Sweet Dreams,” “Faded Heart” and finally the song that put him on the map: “Electric Love.” It was during this song that he picked up the guitar once again and invited the audience to sing the beginning harmonies along with him.</p>\n<p>While the headliners of this show were alt-J, it was quite clear that this crowd would now be leaving the SB Bowl with a new appreciation for the music, style and stage presence of a very Mick-Jagger-esque Børns.</p>\n<p>Although it was obvious that an alt-J concert would attract all the local hipsters here in Santa Barbara, it was quite interesting to see the diversity in the age of audience members. This further reinforces the likeability of alt-J, as they’re able to appeal to almost anyone — Glenn Howerton, better known as Dennis on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” was even there showing his support and admiration for the band as a fellow civilian concertgoer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82530\" style=\"width: 1810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"620383098\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82528\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82530\" data-attachment-id=\"82530\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/alt-j-and-borns-breeze-through-santa-barbara-bowl/unnamed-54/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82530\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Beginning their lively set with “Deadcrush” off their newest studio album <em>Relaxer</em>, alt-J presented their fans with a very visually stunning stage setup and light show. From left to right was Gus Unger-Hamilton on keyboard, Joe Newman on guitar and vocals and Thom Sonny Green on drums, with each member divided by an open-knit curtain of lights that synchronized with the band’s music. Additionally, behind them was a giant lit-up triangle that the band uses as a logo since it comes from the Greek letter “delta” and represents change.</p>\n<p>Everywhere, fans were either jumping out of their seats and belting out each word to each song or happily relaxing while they bobbed their heads along to the contagious melodies. New songs like “In Cold Blood” and “Pleader” seemed to capture and maintain the attention of the crowd; however, it was incomparable to the change in audience hype when alt-J performed fan favorites like “Fitzpleasure,” “Tesselate” and “Matilda.” It was during these songs in particular that sober and drunk fans alike were able to come together and truly express their love for the music as one coherent entity.</p>\n<p>In an effort to wrap things up, alt-J ended their set with “Left Hand Free,” which has been played almost everywhere since its release and has since been featured in major motion picture films like “Captain America: Civil War.” This was the one that got each audience member up off their feet as they were enticed to sing along to the band’s biggest hit. All too soon though, the stage went from flickering purple and white lights to pure darkness, and everyone was left waiting in anticipation for an encore.</p>\n<p>In the end, the boys of alt-J came back out to perform an additional three songs for their eager and beloved fans, and the show concluded with the song that made them famous to begin with: “Breezeblocks.” After a night of playing a medley of old and new songs, it was rather refreshing to see alt-J go back to their roots and give thanks to the many that have helped them achieve this level of success. If you happened to miss this spectacular show here at the Santa Barbara Bowl, both alt-J and Børns, will be playing at Weekend 2 of Coachella –– so go catch them if you can.</p><div

performance is genuinely reflective of the band’s success, and it elevated the record’s feelings of happiness to newer heights.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Real Estate has found a brilliant niche in their vibrant, dreamy sound that provides a meditative atmosphere for ambitious explorers and daydreamers alike. The East Coast indie group has developed a unique aesthetic of elevated background music, having an outer layer of calm waves and a deeper layer of meaning and inspiration. Their live performance last Sunday at SOhO in downtown Santa Barbara displays this perfectly with fluctuating moments of passionate energy, as well as longer drawn-out spells of connected tranquility. Their performance is genuinely reflective of the band’s success, and it elevated the record’s feelings of happiness to newer heights.</p>\n<p>The longer I waited in the intimate space of SOhO, the more I realized I was in for a night away from the normal day-to-day of college life. After making my way to the bar area and ordering a gin and tonic before the show, I noticed that there was a very apparent sense of high audience diversity. Along with the high presence of Doc Martens and cuffed jeans from the college crowd, as expected, there was also a somewhat surprising amount of an older Santa Barbara crowd. Thinking back, this rings true to the band’s appeal as their pure and refined rock sound recalls older bands of music history, such as The Smiths and Pink Floyd. Moments before the tunes began, the venue filled to full capacity and anticipation filled the Sunday air. Acoustic indie songstress Bedouine kicked off the night’s festivities with soothing ballads from her 2017 self-titled release and accurately set the stage for the music to follow. After a powerful ovation from the crowd and an unfortunate goodbye from Bedouine, the stage was set for the next phase of the evening.</p>\n<p>Real Estate took to the stage and was met with high applause, and they delivered immediately with classics “Saturday” and “Had to Hear.” The music sounded as clean and vibrant as expected with a balanced mix and well-orchestrated connection. The band’s limited physical movement and crowd interaction mixed well with the feel of the sound and was balanced out by an extremely sonically pleasing presence. Although the group uses dreamy instrumentals and drawn-out essays to generate atmosphere, the life context is often successful in making these lengthy moments feel like an instant. I often found myself drifting away in Real Estate’s harmonies only to come back to reality feeling like a lifetime had just passed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The hands-down most powerful moment of the night was early in the set when the band performed the hit song “Darling” from their latest album, <em>In Mind</em>. The synth chords moved beautifully in and out of the song’s arrangement and set a gorgeous landscape for the performance of the track. The disorienting off-beats of the instrumental hit perfectly, which was by far the most effective moment of the night in connecting with the audience; it made me move and smile like an entranced fan. Afterwards, the applause was at an all-time high for the night, and the crowd showed an amount of euphoria that I haven’t seen in a long time. It was a moment that left the crowd wondering what could possibly come next to keep the audience alive. Needless to say, the band kept the mood moving.</p>\n<p>After that glorious display of bliss, Real Estate followed with a one-two punch of “White Light” and “Crime.” Afterward came the most wild and heavy moment of the night with <em>In Time</em> standout “Two Arrows.” The track features a long psychedelic instrumental outro that makes plenty of noise in the studio version, but a mere listen to a digital copy of the song does no justice to what would happen live. The live rendition was long, distorted and crazy, with high-pitched self-made feedback screeching from the lead guitar, a punching bassline and eclectic drum fills from the sticks in the back. There were time switches and solos and guitar thrashes that left the audience in awe. When it finally faded out and all the chaos ended, there was a moment of stillness where it seemed that neither the viewers nor the band even knew what to do.</p>\n<p>A tremendous applause erupted as the bassist happily proclaimed, “It’s different every time. That was the Santa Barbara version.”</p>\n<p>After we all recovered from that display, Real Estate followed up with more vibes of “Serve the Song” and “It’s Real,” before heading out to commence the encore. After a surprisingly cohesive chant of “Real Estate!” the band came back out to appease the crowd with “Municipality” and end with show essential “Talking Backwards.”</p>\n<p>It is especially important to note the power of the band’s closer. “Talking Backwards” was a beautifully reflective moment for the set, which was the band executed flawlessly. Arguably the band’s biggest and best song, it ended the night with a sort of victory lap for the night’s main event, displaying that they are alive and well, better than ever and living it up in the beautiful and immersive atmosphere that they have created. It was outstanding, it was gorgeous, it was near perfect, and it left all of us feeling so damn happy. The night was above and beyond the level of quality and emotion that was expected, showing just what a successful, transparent and heartwarming band Real Estate is.</p><div

BADBADNOTGOOD on their latest project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IV</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to have Charlotte Day Wilson’s spectacular vocals implemented on “In Your Eyes,” a track in which the singer gleams and steals much of the sonic spotlight. This is where I first discovered the Toronto-based singer. After having delivered a delightful debut EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CDW, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson is back to welcome listeners into her vulnerable world of romanticism and empowerment. Titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her subsequent EP consists of six lovely ballads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project opens with the single “Stone Woman,” a bare minimalistic track. Although quite simple, the song serves to foreshadow the tone of the works that proceed it. The EP’s title track concludes with a pleasant transition into “Doubt,” where Wilson profoundly rides the slow-paced acoustics, sincerely admitting, “What have I done for your love?” In the second portion, Wilson promptly enters into liberating bellows over fast-paced drums and ends on a strong note. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson’s voice is gentle, almost sounding too fragile. At moments, one may start to doubt her ability to break into high-pitched vocals. Nevertheless, she exceeds expectations. Sounding so nimble at one moment and ascending into emotional breakthroughs the next, Wilson proves that she is merely tapping into a prowess which many vocalists train tirelessly to maintain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson does well in illuminating the spectrum of R&amp;B with neo-soul instrumentals that work as backdrops to her booming vocals. On “Nothing New,” she employs an electronically-induced beat which resonates throughout the background of the track. At the peak of the synths one can hear a faint shriek that sounds almost effortless and comes down to a mellow fadeaway.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The singer moves eloquently through versatile musicality and takes an avant-garde approach to the varying melodies. Following “Nothing New,” producer River Tiber grabs hold of Wilson and leads her into a darker tone for the soulful “Let You Down.” The jazzy drum beats are similar to sounds from BADBADNOTGOOD, which does not come as a surprise considering the artists’ collaborative history. River Tiber, who’s discography also consists of tracks with artists such as KAYTRANADA and Daniel Caesar, provides an incredible space where Wilson finds much success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Falling Apart,” Tiber returns to provide an eerie instrumental as a silhouette to Wilson. She sings, “Falling deeper and I’m never coming home/Never coming home, no,” dropping into the atmospheric area which is Tiber’s intoxicating production. Ending with “Funeral,” a melancholic anthem, Wilson invites listeners to discover some of the dark thoughts that frame her mentality and brings the task full circle with jazzy saxophone and trumpets that outline the bridge of the song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast to her debut EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CDW, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson proves to have a stronger grasp of structuring her instrumentals. The concept behind the EP’s title, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, could be interpreted as a play on words: Wilson has gained some stability as a musician and maybe just as a human being as she has searched for validation and for someone who cares.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Wilson takes listeners through a path filled with discovery of self-worth and desire to fulfill impulses for love. Many artists thrive in their storytelling abilities. With Wilson, listeners do not receive too many of the specific details or really much of a narrative, yet her lyricism does well in evoking different facets of emotion. It is evident in the way she shares her feelings that she’s lost someone who once filled the gap which still remains. There is no doubt that with Wilson’s talent, she has the star potential, but where the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone Woman </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decides to go remains entirely in her control. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-83945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Bandcamp</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitski Miyawaki has outdone herself. The singer-songwriter, known mononymously as Mitski, released her fifth studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">via Dead Oceans on August 17 to seemingly unanimous critical acclaim. In an album so aesthetically different from her prior works, Mitski proves that she does not need to lean on her lo-fi indie rock niche, as she breaks out of her classic use of vocal overlays and grainy tracks as heard on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Puberty 2 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bury Me At Makeout Point</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitski is one of the rare artists who can articulate feelings so complex, that trying to formulate the words to describe them usually seems futile. She isn’t afraid to broadcast emotions and desires that seem ugly or taboo because she knows everybody else feels them, too. That’s what makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such a standout: Every relationship is unique, but the corresponding feelings remain universal, and Mitski chooses to lean into the discomfort with an unflinching candor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Geyser,” is one of Mitski’s more cohesive songs with her previous work. The album begins with a hazy intro and the yearning lyrics, “You’re my number one / You’re the one I want / And you’ve turned down / Every hand that has beckoned me to come.” Unlike many of her other tracks, Mitski admitted in an interview with NPR that “Geyser” breaks from her traditional use of narrative and instead is “all feeling.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may seem to reference a lover, Mitski sings of her relationship with music and her career. Being an artist has led to her sacrifice of her physical and mental health and her relationships with other people. She skillfully personifies music as a partner, thus allowing “Geyser” to remain wholly relatable, even for those who are not so musically inclined. She ends the song with the woeful, “I will be the one you need / I just can’t be without you,” which is indicative of any passionate — maybe even unhealthy — relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second song on the album, “Why Didn’t You Stop Me?” portrays a self-centered desire for an ex. In this narrative Mitski finds herself feeling regretful after ending things with her partner. “I know I ended it, but / Why won’t you chase after me?” she asks. As the song continues it becomes clear that Mitski has a distorted perception of her partner and the relationship they had together, as she sings, “I look for a picture of you / To keep in my pocket / But I can’t seem to find one / Where you look how I remember / Look how I remember.” It seems incredibly bold for an artist to shed light on a relationship in a way that lacks a whimsical and nostalgic element. While the music may retain these undertones, the lyrics tell a different story of warped ideas of other people and even of ourselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most relatable track on the entire album, Mitski delves into the sentiment behind trying to settle the score with an ex on “Lonesome Love.” She sings of putting on makeup and high heels to prove to her ex that she has moved on and is thriving, but upon seeing them immediately softens and completely loses the upper hand. The melody shifts from an upbeat acoustic guitar to a more solemn tone as she mournfully sings, “‘Cause nobody butters me up like you / And nobody fucks me like me.” Mitski manages to completely gut her listeners (and all in under two minutes) as she relays a story that may feel all too familiar to many. She ends the song on a solemn note: “Why am I lonely for lonesome love? / Why am I lonely?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to her incredible vocals, Mitski is also a profound lyricist. She shows off some of her best songwriting chops on album-standout “Nobody.” Juxtaposed with the upbeat music, the strikingly sad lyrics once again touch on feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. Possibly the most insightful verse on the entire album, Mitski compares her own desires to the greenhouse gases on the planet Venus: “Venus, planet of love / Was destroyed by global warming / Did its people want too much too? / Did its people want too much?” Breaking from the abstract she goes onto sing, “And I don’t want your pity / I just want somebody near me.” On this particular verse, Mitski explained that she views pity as the “emotion you have for someone who’s, like, lower than you. I don’t want your fucking pity…Don’t judge me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so much available content about relationships and all that comes with them, Mitski still finds a way to offer a refreshing take. The album is so densely packed with hits that touching on all of them would simply be too lofty an effort. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be the Cowboy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proves to be Mitski’s magnum opus. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
