Hamner said philanthropy is essential to helping raise UCSB’s national ranking.</p>\n<p>“We really encourage students to give back to the school once they graduate,” Hamner said. “Even if a student gives one dollar or five dollars, it ups our ranking because it shows alumni involvement.”</p>\n<p>According to Fenton, UCSB First will also use Food Truck Cinema as a platform to announce the senior class gift, which was voted upon by members of this year’s senior class. The winning result, Fenton said, will determine which of three options on the ballot will have a fund opened on its behalf at the end of the school year: Associated Students Food Bank, A.S. Academic Resource Fund or the Student Safety Enhancement Fund.</p>\n<p>“[A senior class gift] is an opportunity for seniors to create a legacy and stay connected with their alma mater,” Fenton said. “UC Santa Barbara is a strong community, and giving to this gift demonstrates our firm belief in Gauchos helping Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>UCSB First is also partnering with the Associate Students Food Bank by recommending that attendees bring canned food donations to the event, according to A.S. Food Bank coordinator and alumna Tuyen Nguyen.</p>\n<p>Nguyen also said 10 percent of the proceeds from the food trucks will also go to A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p>“If there is something in the back of your pantry that you are willing and able to part with, it could always be used to help other students who utilize our pantry,” Nguyen said. “We also encourage [buying food] in whatever capacity people can engage and be able to give back.”</p>\n<p>Food Truck Cinema, Fenton said, will also be hosting tabling from various student organizations like Dance Marathon, Active Minds, DJ Club and the Education Abroad Program.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to provide more fun things for students to do,” Fenton said. “This is an opportunity for students to learn more about their campus and where they can get involved in.”</p>\n<p>According to Hamner, deciding what movie to screen was a difficult decision due to factors like appropriateness and popularity.</p>\n<p>“It actually took such a long time to pick a movie because we wanted to do a film that everyone would like and be able to relate to,” Hamner said.</p>\n<p>In the end, “Anchorman” was the right choice, according to Fenton.</p>\n<p>“We thought it was a fun movie and kind of nostalgic to most people,” Fenton said. “Plus everyone loves Will Ferrell.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the event would provide free food to attendees. That is incorrect, food will be sold.

During their open forum Saifuddin and Oved explained the student regent application process and discussed the responsibilities that accompany the position in order to reach out to a more diverse pool of applicants for the 2016-17 Student Regent application. Issues facing UC students were also discussed, including mental health, food security and the recently approved tuition increase plan.</p>\n<p>Saifuddin said the main issue facing UC students today, which she has focused on extensively during her term as a regent, is food security. According to Saifuddin, she is looking to address issues of food inaccessibility for students on campuses in which food prices tend to be high.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a problem that students have to make a decision between books and food,” Saifuddin said. “Students should never have to skip a meal. I’m working on creating a system-wide food security model that still has the flexibility for each of the campuses to adapt for their own culture and their own needs, but has some kind of coordinated response so that students don’t go hungry.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik, who attended the forum to learn about how students can mobilize to support student regents, Saifuddin and Oved are using a different recruitment approach this year, meeting with students across the system in an open forum, as well as forums specifically for African American, Asian Pacific American, Chicano/Latino, American Indian/Native American, Middle Eastern and undocumented student minority groups.</p>\n<p>“They are looking for a very diverse group of applicants this year and that’s the exact reason why they’re doing this tour … to talk with students that are on the ground, students that perhaps have not understood what this position entails and to get them interested,” Abdalmalik said. “I think that they have done a very good job of doing so, especially when talking to students that are normally underrepresented such as Middle Eastern students, undocumented students.”</p>\n<p>During the forum, Saifuddin said her experience as the only member of the Board of Regents outside of ex-officio members to vote “no” on the proposed tuition increase was difficult but necessary.</p>\n<p>“You’re kinda backed up against the wall when you’re a student regent,” Saifuddin said. “Students don’t need another tuition increase. It really puts a crunch on middle class students and our campuses really have a big chunk of middle class students.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, students from an upper-income level family could likely handle an increase of $600, which is approximately what the tuition increase would be annually, but that it puts unnecessary pressure on middle-income students.</p>\n<p>“It seems kinda affordable, but for middle-class students that’s like one month of rent and that’s a lot of hours of work,” Saifuddin said. “Work-study jobs do not make that much. It’s very rare to find a work study job that makes over $15 an hour, and that’s on the high end. It was kind of personal for me because I had gone through a tuition increase and I had to work. I felt that craziness, and really depression.”</p>\n<p>Saifuddin also said she is concerned by what she perceives as continued divestment in the UC by the state over the last 10 to 20 years.</p>\n<p>“The state is slowly dwindling the funds and increasing the budget for things like the Rainy Day Fund that the governor put another like $1.2 billion dollars into in the recent budgets, or prisons, which are really big, actually one of the things at the top,” Saifuddin said. “But when you work with students so intimately you understand what their personal struggle is and I just can’t support that.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Oved is currently working on addressing safety on UC campuses, an issue he said he tackled while working in student government at UCLA and will continue to focus on when he becomes the official Student Regent in July of this year.</p>\n<p>“One thing that we did is develop a mobile panic button safety application,” Oved said. “It was an idea I got from the UC [blue light] phone booths, but those aren’t practical. What we wanted to do was heighten safety resources at UCLA and make it more relevant so students are more equipped with resources. So in the event of an emergency they would be able to respond.”</p>\n<p>According to Oved, the mobile safety application was created in partnership with Circle of 6, a free app that aims to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. The application, according to Oved, “centralizes” emergency communication efforts with six friends that become informed of a person’s location via GPS if they press a button indicating they need help.</p>\n<p>Oved said the application also centralizes safety information with campus resources like Community Service Organization (CSO) and Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE).</p>\n<p>“It’s these resources that I was told by multiple students, ‘I wish I had that, that night, when I really needed it,’ ” Oved said. “I think it’s a really valuable tool and really starts the conversation about safety awareness as well. It also falls under the umbrella of [the UC] President’s task force on responding to and protecting students from sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, the Board of Regents is also discussing how to address student mental health issues and how to make counseling and other resources more available to students struggling with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“Right now students make appointments for mental health counselors or psychologists and what ends up happening is they have to wait four, or five or six weeks, and then it’s finals time and it’s like, ‘Okay well, good job, nothing happened, we weren’t able to help students,’ ” Saifuddin said. “Every year there is a suicide on campus, so it’s really, really critical that we deal with this problem.”</p>\n<p>Oved also said working one-on-one with UC President Janet Napolitano can be refreshing, because unlike some members of the Board of Regents she is very candid when communicating with Oved and Saifuddin.</p>\n<p>“When we have meeting with her she doesn’t sugar coat her answers,” Oved said. “She is very straight forward. ‘Yes I agree and we’ll support this’ or ‘No I don’t agree and this is why.’ ”</p>\n<p>According to Oved however, the Board’s straight-forward way of communicating can also be “frustrating.”</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes that’s also a really frustrating thing in the student regent position is that you want to do so well and to advocate and to make a dent in your term,” Oved said, “but oftentimes there are people within the democracy who don’t really necessarily want to jump on board with you.”</p>\n<p>Second year biopsychology major Niki Elyasi said she thought the student regents did a “fantastic job” during the forums and are commendable for reaching out to more students in order to allow for a more diverse student regent applicant pool.</p>\n<p>“Bringing people who haven’t been involved in student government, [like] undocumented students [and] Middle Eastern students — I think that is just really, really great,” Elyasi said. “I give them huge kudos for spearheading that and for taking so much time out of what they do to just to reach out to people and make them see that this is something that you can actually do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/uc-student-regent-designate-meets-with-students/","id":2948,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2947,2946,2945],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The event involves male members of various Greek Life organizations competing for the title of Mr. Greek Universe. The event fell under scrutiny by some members of the finance board.</p>\n<p>The first objector to the re-allocation of funding for the event came from Senator Steven Kwok who raised the issue of whether or not the planned desserts were in line with A.S. regulations regarding the funding of sustainable food.</p>\n<p>“My issue with the desserts is that they are primarily going to spend it on brownies from Costco,” Kwok said. “That does not meet the Green Bill to the best of my knowledge, so I don’t think we should be funding that portion of the re-allocation. Fifty percent of the food that you buy has to be from sustainable sources.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nadia Blant said she took issue with the possible exclusivity of the event.</p>\n<p>“The only people allowed to compete are Greek so if they’re getting money, that seems unfair,” Blant said. “Is there any way that stipulates that any and all competitions have to be all inclusive?”</p>\n<p>Senator Casey Firenze disagreed with Blant and said that if an event is open to all students as spectators, that is enough to qualify it for student funding, regardless of whether or not event participation is inclusive or not.</p>\n<p>“I just want to say about the whole Greek system thing, I thought that we were in agreement that if anyone can come watch it, it’s fine,” Firenze said. “And anyone can come watch.”</p>\n<p>Blant contended and said that an event that is open is not necessarily open enough.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, just open to attend is not inclusive enough,” said Blant.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Jasmine Moses said she was personally offended by Blant’s suggestion to not fund events primarily targeting a Greek community audience because of her membership in Greek Life organizations.</p>\n<p>“The way in which you said [that Mr. Greek Universe should not be funded], it made me feel some type of way because I am in the Greek community,” Moses said.<br>\nAfter discussion, the Board passed a motion granting the re-allocation of $160 for food and desserts, but not for sashes or a crown.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Chinese Students and Scholars Association requested $1,100 to hold a dating game show event in Corwin Pavilion. According to CSSA representatives, the matchmaking event would feature several singles answering questions about their relationship goals in front of an audience and being assigned potential dates.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Kherishma Shah did not approve of the event, questioning its value to the overall student population.</p>\n<p>“Personally I don’t see how this event would benefit UCSB in any way possible,” Shah said. It’s pretty much watching people, like, meet, that’s all it is.”<br>\nFinance Officer Jerel Constantino supported funding the CSSA’s event and said the Finance committee is responsible for financing events for a diverse range of students with different cultural backgrounds and entertainment preferences.</p>\n<p>“We all know this event is catered toward the international community, right? And I don’t know about you guys but my mom is from an East Asian country, this show is familiar to me,” Constantino said. “I think for us to tell [CSSA] this isn’t entertainment, that’s kind of ripping on their culture. It might not be fun for you, but it’s fun for the Chinese students who show up, who are also paying into student fees and who are also part of this community.”<br>\nThe Finance Board eventually approved $844 in funding for CSSA’s event.</p>\n<p>A Community Affairs Board request for $230 in re-allocation for buying toys for children living in Storke Family Housing and $1,850 funding request for toys for local children by the Sigma Chi Omega fraternity also sparked debate among the members of the committee.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Haley Ferrera proposed that both initiatives come with a stipulation that the funding be used for purchasing gender-neutral toys.<br>\nChief Finance Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus objected on the basis that if the committee required the stipulation, it would be overstepping its bounds as a purely financial organization.</p>\n<p>“I’m all down for gender-neutral toys, but I feel like a lot of our personal beliefs on things is kind of getting pushed on these groups and their organizations. Like a male beauty pageant is hella bad in some spaces, they find that very heteronormative,” Theus said. “If we start with one group, I feel like we have to start doing an inclusivity check on all events. That’s a precedent we will have to start following.”</p>\n<p>Both CAB and Sigma Chi Omega were granted their requests with a recommendation, but not stipulation, from A.S. asking that funds be used for gender-neutral toys.</p>\n<p>Other notable motions passed included $1,970 in funding to the Swing and Ballroom Dancing Club for an event winter quarter, $3,200 to La Familia de Colores for plane tickets to an LGBTQ event in Denver and $3,000 to the Women’s Club Soccer team to help cover expenses related to participating in a national championship tournament in Memphis.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-59711\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of UCSB Philosophy Department.</p></div>\n<p>Graduate student Jason Andrew Bennett, a fifth-year doctoral student in philosophy, died on Dec. 31 after committing suicide at age 32.</p>\n<p>Bennett received his Bachelors and Masters degrees in philosophy from UC Santa Cruz and enrolled at UCSB in 2010, where he earned a second Masters degree and became a Ph.D candidate with the philosophy department. Bennett’s primary research interests included the intersection between language logic and the limits of linguistic expression. Bennett also left a suicide note on his blog “<a href=\"http://notes.dedicto.org/the-note\">de dicto</a>“<strong> </strong>along with a lengthier post attached to the note providing instructions on how to distribute his possessions, including a number of paintings he created and posted to his blog.</p>\n<p>Philosophy Department Chair Thomas Holden said Bennett’s death was unexpected and that Bennett was a bright student and respectable person.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be holding a faculty memorial to share stories about Jason soon,” Holden said. “He was a brilliant student. He really was. He was a little quiet guy, very dignified and respectful. He was a stand-up guy … We’ll miss him.”</p>\n<p>Nathan Salmon, graduate student adviser for the department of philosophy, said Bennett was among the most talented students of philosophy that has been seen in the department.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s fair to say that I’ve never known a graduate student with more raw ability in philosophy than he had,” Salmon said. “And I’ve known many who are very, very talented. He was right up there in terms of raw talent. That was obvious really, from the start. He was very humble … to the point where people didn’t realize quite how talented he was.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett had a rough childhood and had “overcome extreme adversity.”</p>\n<p>“He grew up in an abusive home and he ran away from home at age 16,” Salmon said. “But he had to leave behind his younger siblings — he wasn’t old enough to take care of them himself. He really wasn’t even able to take care of himself.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett never gave any indication that he was tormented about his past and that his death took everyone by surprise.</p>\n<p>“By all appearances it looks as if he had completely overcome it,” Salmon said. “He was so capable. He just looked like he had a very promising future ahead of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett’s blog post on his website “de dicto” on Dec. 31 makes clear that he put time and thought into the decision before taking his life.</p>\n<p>“His suicide message was very methodical, very well-planned and thoughtful,” Salmon said. “It was clearly something he had been thinking about for quite some time. He took all of the kind of precautions and measures to make it easier for people who survived him to deal with his death and donated his body to UC San Francisco Medical School.”</p>\n<p>Salmon said that while graduate students are commonly under pressure, he does not believe Bennett’s death is a result of an insecurity about his studies.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be a mistake to conclude that he was under the kind of depression that comes from insecurity, not feeling that he wasn’t valued enough from his teacher,” Salmon said. “He knew his teachers thought very well of him and expected good things from him. He knew he was impressive to them, so it was probably something else. He didn’t talk to anyone about what tormented him.”</p>\n<p>According to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Janet Osimo, people who commit suicide often think about the decision for a long period of time and see no other alternatives. She also said childhood trauma can affect individuals long after the events occur and that some individuals have a genetic predisposition to depression.</p>\n<p>“For them they see it as that they’ve tried everything and that people that they leave behind will be better off,” Osimo said. “A lot of times a reason that they want to be dead is so they can be out of pain. Past traumatic events can absolutely effect individuals long after they’ve happened and some people may be more prone to depression through family genetics.”</p>\n<p>Osimo said people feeling depressed or having suicidal thoughts should talk to someone or reach out to a suicide hotline, 911 or use the 24/7 CAPS counseling number.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times people wait until they’re in crisis to seek help” Osimo said. “Research shows that it’s better to seek help sooner, your symptoms will alleviate faster and stay away longer. However, if someone is facing a crisis and feeling like they want to end their life, they should call a suicide hotline or dial 911 for immediate help.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/","id":2950,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2949,2948,2947],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
