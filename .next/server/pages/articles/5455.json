This weekend will be Santa Barbara’s best opportunity to capitalize since it is the only ranked team amongst its opponents.</p>\n<p>So far the Gauchos have only played one game against an unranked opponent, Cal Baptist, and took home the victory 10-4. Despite the statistics, Coach Kay knows that numbers do not matter at the end of the day, assuring that the team’s “mentality does not change with opponent.”</p>\n<p>The first matchup will be against the University of La Verne, who is 3-0 thus far this season. It was an encouraging 2015 season for the Leopards, who finished with an overall record of 7-14 under first-year Head Coach William Rodriguez. Despite being a year full of changes and adjustments, La Verne managed to surprise everyone by taking fifth-place in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest strengths that La Verne depends on is its depth. With seven returning players and a great recruiting class, the Leopards have players ready to step in when needed or just to keep a fresh group in the water. This helps the team maintain their attack strong, going on unanswered runs right away that make it hard for their opponent to try to come back. So far, two of its three wins have been by a double-figure margin. Most notably, in the Leopards’ season opener, they defeated Grove City College by a score of 24-3.</p>\n<p>Although it is a young team, the Leopards have a roster with talented players such as freshman attacker Guarina Garcia. The Puerto Rico native has scored nine goals in La Verne’s three matches. She is a member of the Puerto Rico senior national team, as well as the junior national team. Garcia won a silver medal at the XXII Central American and Caribbean games and has played in several of the Pan-Am games.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day will be against Claremont Mudd-Scripps, who is 1-5 overall so far this season. Its lone victory came in its opening match against Concordia. The Athenas finished 11-17 overall, 8-3 in conference last year and took third-place at the SCIAC Championships.</p>\n<p>It seems to be that Claremont’s biggest challenge is its defense’s inability to prevent opponents from scoring. Out of its five losses, four of them were by 10 points or more. No. 6 Hawaii and No.21 Long Beach defeated the Athenas 20-3, 20-5 respectively.</p>\n<p>The leading scorer for Claremont is Santa Barbara native, sophomore attacker Jessica Gaffney, who has a total of eight goals in the last five games. After leading the team last year with 21 goals, 22 assists, 16 drawn ejections and 22 steals, she was named to the SCIAC Second Team.</p>\n<p>Both of UCSB’s matches are set to be played this Saturday, March 5. Its first game against La Verne will be played at 1 p.m. at the Axelrod Pool. Following is the Gauchos’ matchup against Claremont Mudd-Scripps at the same location at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68782\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/no-14-ucsb-to-conclude-road-trip-at-claremont-convergence-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68782\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/no-14-ucsb-to-conclude-road-trip-at-claremont-convergence-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/no-14-ucsb-to-conclude-road-trip-at-claremont-convergence-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/no-14-ucsb-to-conclude-road-trip-at-claremont-convergence-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/no-14-ucsb-to-conclude-road-trip-at-claremont-convergence-tournament/","id":5455,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5454,5453,5452],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon","biography":"Not available","articles":[1970,4969,4970,4971,4987,4989,4994,4997,5007,5010,5011,5012,5014,5453,5454,5455,5457,5458,5459,5471,5477],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Stakes Remain High With UCSB On Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite no real shot at representing the Big West in the NCAA Tournament, the UCSB women's volleyball team remains motivated to win out the remainder of the season.

She stands at fourth in the conference in digs per set against Big West foes with 4.24.</p>\n<p>The engine of their offense is powered by senior setter Sophia Mar and sophomore Maddie Merlino, who have put up 6.24 assists per set and 5.73 assists per set, respectively, against Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Their two pronged attack will be an adjustment for the Gauchos, as they’ve played against one setter for their past three matches.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine has similarly won three of its past five matches. The differences between the two teams, however, include Irvine’s ability to come away with at least one set against Hawaii and fortune to hand Long Beach State its first loss of the season in five sets.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters will try and rebound from a devastating loss in their final match last weekend against Cal State Northridge after having been ahead by two sets.</p>\n<p>Clearly a team with considerable upside after their recent results, Irvine has relied on redshirt senior outside hitter Victoria Dennis and sophomore opposite hitter Harlee Kekauoha against conference competition, as the duo has averaged 3.43 and 2.82 kills per set respectively.</p>\n<p>Kekauoha also leads the Big West with .64 service aces per set in conference play. She has a total of 11 total service aces thus far this season.</p>\n<p>Senior setter Shelley Anderson greases the wheels for the Anteaters, contributing 10.22 assists per set, the fifth most prolific mark against Big West teams this season.</p>\n<p>The defensive effort is centered around junior libero Luna Tsujimoto, whose 4.15 digs per set place her just behind Davis’s Malia Bolko in the conference. First-year middle blocker Makayla Wolfe adds 1.42 blocks per set, the only non-Hawaii player in the stats top four during the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>This weekend the Gauchos will rely heavily on sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi, who has consistently made her case as the league’s best defender and continues to lead the Big West with 4.62 digs per set when matched up with conference opponents.</p>\n<p>Redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley will look to continue her ascent as her stellar play has begun to receive recognition; she was named Big West Freshman of the Week after her dominant outing in San Luis Obispo this past weekend, and her 10.49 assists per set still rank third in Big West play.</p>\n<p>The offense will continue to be driven by redshirt first-year Lindsey Ruddins, who has dominated with 3.44 kills per set in conference play, and junior Chanel Hoffman (3.19 kills per set in conference), who has been the keystone for UCSB’s season thus far.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blockers Elizabeth Sheffield and Phoebe Grunt will look to continue a hot streak of play where opponents have had major difficulties attacking the Gauchos at the net.</p>\n<p>Winners of two straight and riding a wave of excellent play, the Gauchos are poised to assert themselves as postseason threats in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match with the Aggies will be at 7 p.m. on Nov. 3 in Davis, after which they will get a day of rest. The Gauchos then travel to Irvine for Saturday’s 7 p.m. match with the Anteaters on Nov. 5.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November, 3 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73706\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73706\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/stakes-remain-high-with-ucsb-on-road/","id":5452,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5451,5450,5449],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 17 Gauchos Prepare for UCI Invitational this Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's water polo team will attempt to erase its three-match losing streak playing in the UC Irvine Invitational.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended its visit to San Diego with a win over No. 22 Marist College, but were defeated by No. 7 Arizona State, No. 14 Loyola Marymount University and No. 13 UC San Diego.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s subpar 1-3 finish, there were some individual standout performances throughout the team’s two days of competition.</p>\n<p>On opening day of the invitational, the Gauchos were led by redshirt senior center Lauren Martin who put away four goals, including a hat trick against the Red Foxes. The Fresno native shot 3-4 to sustain a .581 shooting percentage this season.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, junior utility Taylor Shore was active in stealing the ball, collecting seven on the day— three of which were against the Sun Devils. Complementing Shore was senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw who had nine saves in total and three steals per game.</p>\n<p>However, it was senior attacker Bryn Hudson who took the second day of the invitational with her outstanding work in the pool, finding the back of the net for a combined seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against the Tritons. She also went on to contribute five assists in the second game of the day against LMU.</p>\n<p>“<u></u>Bryn Hudson is tough as nails,” Coach Kay said. “She [Hudson] plays with the same mental toughness no matter who the opponent.  She will continue to make an impact not only as a playmaker but also as a scorer.”</p>\n<p>Brokaw on her part had 12 saves in the first match to go along with two steals. She tallied six saves and a steal in the second contest, but it was not enough to lead the Gauchos to victory as they dropped both games on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With that behind them, the Gauchos will now focus on what is to come this weekend. There are a total of 16 teams participating, which are divided into four separate groups. Santa Barbara is placed in “Group C” along with tough competitors such as No. 3 Cal, No.6 Hawaii, No.12 Pacific.</p>\n<p>The first matchup for UCSB will be Saturday morning against No. 3 Cal. The Bears are 13-1 overall after their solid performance at the UC Davis Invitational in which they defeated No. 12 Pacific and Brown University. Cal will look to extend its current nine-match winning streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos faced the Bears earlier this season in an intense game that went into overtime. A goal by sophomore driver Carla Carrega in the last seven seconds of the match clinched the Bears’ second chance, forcing the game into its extra period. It was in overtime where Cal finished the game to defeat Santa Barbara by a score of 9-8.</p>\n<p>“We have now played 4 OT games so far this season and I believe if we are resilient these games will teach lessons in big moments come Big West Championship time,” Coach Kay said. “This is what we have been focusing on to prepare for this coming weekend where every game in the tournament will be a fight to the final buzzer.”</p>\n<p>The biggest threat to the Gauchos will once again be Carrega, who is responsible for most of the Golden Bears’ scoring so far this season. The sophomore currently ranks third in the MPSF in scoring, averaging 2.21 goals per game and is second in total goals scored with 31.</p>\n<p>Apart from the sophomore driver, providing the Bears with productive play are Dora Antal and Anna Illes, who will both participate in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, after their outstanding performances with Hungary in the 2016 European Championships last month.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the UCSB vs. Cal rematch will be an exciting match to watch, and also an important one. The result of the match will dictate who the Gauchos will face in its next match on Sunday, Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on the Bears at 10:30 a.m. at Corona del Mar High School this Saturday, Feb. 27.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68567\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-17-gauchos-prepare-for-uci-invitational-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68567\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-17-gauchos-prepare-for-uci-invitational-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-17-gauchos-prepare-for-uci-invitational-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-17-gauchos-prepare-for-uci-invitational-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/no-17-gauchos-prepare-for-uci-invitational-this-weekend/","id":5453,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5452,5451,5450],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 17 Gauchos Recover from Slow Start in UCI Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensWaterPolo_1-24-16_7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Losses to No. 3 Cal and No. 12 Pacific in the first day of the UCI invitational extended the UCSB women's water polo team's losing streak to five matches.

Santa Barbara’s first goal of the match came at the 1:52 mark of the second period by redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader. Cal quickly responded to the score, giving the Bears a three-point advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense was able to limit the Bears’ scoring the first five minutes of the third period, but Cal was able to get two goals in before the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite senior center Lauren Martin, senior attacker Bryn Hudson, and sophomore utility Camila Schafer scoring one each, the match resulted in an 8-4 victory for Cal.</p>\n<p>The loss to Cal led the Gauchos to face Pacific in the second game of the day.</p>\n<p>This time UCSB attacked first and found the back of the net twice by the 5:16 mark. The Tigers retaliated with two goals of their own tying up the game, but thanks to junior utility Taylor Shore it was not for long. The junior gave the Gauchos the lead with her shot at the 0:27 mark of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>In the second period the Tigers came back and grabbed the lead after a two-goal streak, but once again the scoreboard was tied up when freshman defender Kristen Denney scored one more.</p>\n<p>After a back and forth battle for the lead in the third quarter, the game remained tied up 6-6 going into the last period of the game. It was Pacific that managed to get the winning goal at the 1:42 mark earning the Tigers the win.</p>\n<p>Junior attacker Brenna Thomas had two goals against Pacific, while senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had 14 saves adding up to a total of 21 for the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos turned it around the second day sweeping up the competition. In the first game of the day, UCSB collected its first win of the weekend against San Diego State in an overtime battle. It was the second time that the teams had met, once in the Michigan Invitational in which Santa Barbara also came out on top in a 9-8 victory.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs opened up the board with a goal at the two-minute mark, to which UCSB responded with two consecutive goals courtesy of Thomas giving them a one-point deficit lead going into the half.</p>\n<p>The momentum was carried on to the third quarter where the Gauchos scored another two goals for a 4-0 run.</p>\n<p>With the score at 4-1, the Aztecs turned on the jets and put away three goals unanswered. After an ejection drawn by Schrader, junior defender Sophie Trabucco took advantage of the power play and put away the equalizer.</p>\n<p>The first period of overtime went scoreless, then with 1:22 left of the second Trabucco finds the back of the net once again. However, the Aztecs scored thirty seconds later to what seemed would take the game into a sudden death match.</p>\n<p>Just when the cards seemed to have been dealt, Martin came in clutch for the Gauchos drawing an ejection. The senior center did not let the opportunity go to waste, capitalizing on it and giving Santa Barbara the close win 7-6.</p>\n<p>Enhancing Santa Barbara’s momentous win over the Aztecs was its victory against Loyola Marymount to end the day which ended in a 15-12 shootout.</p>\n<p>Martin and Shore both scored five goals each, followed by Schrader with four of her own, and Hudson with one to claim the victory.</p>\n<p>Wasting no time, the Gauchos dominated the first quarter going on a four-goal streak. They maintained the lead throughout the rest of the first half to go into half time leading 7-5.</p>\n<p>Despite an attempted comeback from LMU in the fourth quarter with five goals, the Gauchos had locked in their victory and gathered their second win of the tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face La Verne next at the Axelrod Pool on Saturday, March 5. The match will begin at 1:00 P.M.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/no-17-gauchos-recover-from-slow-start-in-uci-invitational/","id":5454,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5453,5452,5451],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
