If you want to piss UCSB students off, just fuck with their vacation time.</p>\n<p>Of course, this was pretty bad timing. If the UC system had waited until the beginning of summer to announce the schedule change, most students probably would have shrugged it off. But instead, they chose the worst possible time to spring this news on us: two weeks into Winter Quarter, right when we were all wishing Winter Break was still going on. Not the greatest time to say, “Oh, by the way, you’re only getting two weeks off next year! Hope that’s all right with you. No hard feelings, eh?” Grrrr…</p>\n<p>This isn’t a question of <i>how much</i> time off we get. With this change, we still get the same number of weeks of instruction and, by extent ,the same number of weeks off. This is a question of dispersal; the raw material doesn’t matter so much as <i>when</i> we get that break time.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Greeks said, “Everything in moderation.” Our school schedule is not conducive to that goal. It is a schedule of extremes ­- long stretches of schoolwork, and then long stretches of time off. During the school year, we work pretty much straight through nine months. Then, after that academic baby has come to term, we’re suddenly facing more vacation time than we know what to do with: A summer break that stretches out over four months. What the hell am I supposed to do with a summer that long? Rewrite the Constitution?</p>\n<p>And now, thanks to the UC Registrars, we have yet another week tacked onto that already-too-long summer, and, simultaneously, one fewer week during Winter Break that we could use to lighten the load during the school year when we actually need it…</p>\n<p>Winter Break is not about Christmas. I, a Jewish-born atheist who has never celebrated Christmas, am very unhappy about this change, despite having no religious holiday to celebrate. Why? Because Winter Break, like the Christmas holiday itself, is merely a symptom of the winter solstice. Even at moderate latitudes, the waning winter sun has a pronounced effect on the human psyche. It causes significant percentages of people (myself included) to experience the winter blues, and causes many more to feel at least somewhat sluggish and unmotivated. (This isn’t news. We all hate the last week of Fall Quarter.) Winter is the time of year when our biological clock is telling us to crawl into a cave and hibernate. Or, in more human terms, curl up in front of the fire with a good book.</p>\n<p>The bleakness of this time of year is the reason why we celebrate Christmas – a Pagan-derived holiday based around tranquility, familial love, and the rebirth of the sun – only four days after the solstice, and it is also why we take far more vacation time, and attach far more symbolic meaning to Christmas, than would be necessary if it were just another holiday. And if you take away our hibernation time, we’ll be as grumpy as a bear if you woke it in the winter.</p>\n<p>Others have pointed out the unfair favoritism of changing the school schedule in order to accommodate a religious minority. Let’s be clear: anti-Semitism is a serious form of hatred. The very word brings to mind ghastly images of gas chambers, villages burning in pogroms and “A Resolution To Divest From Companies That Profit From Apartheid.” But lacking official observance of Jewish holidays is not anti-Semitism in any sense whatsoever. It’s life, and part of attending a secular public university.</p>\n<p>If I were in a more acerbic mood, I might consider asking my fellow Jews to make the small concession of moving the High Holy Days to the week of December 14, 2014, so that everyone can be happy … but I don’t want to completely blow my chances of ever going on a Birthright trip, so I’ll avoid going down that road, and instead ask the age old question: Is this good for the Jews?</p>\n<p>No, it isn’t. We didn’t ask for this schedule change. And since it was dropped into our lap, it’s hard for observant Jews to not be happy about it. People everywhere are quick to rage against injustice, until it favors them. That’s normal and human. But if we do take advantage of a small injustice that favors us, and shout down anyone who disagrees as an anti-Semite, then will that really generate goodwill and endear the students of this university to the Jewish community?</p>\n<p>To the UC Registrars I can only say this: Please reverse this ridiculous schedule change at once. Summer Break is already too long, and Winter Break already too short. Please, please don’t make it even worse.</p>\n<p><em>Jason Garshfield is a second-year political science major. </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

that has been constantly cycled year after year when looking at industries such as military, media, entertainment and politics (especially during presidential elections; Republican candidate Mitt Romney famously said he had “binders full of women” in 2012 when responding to a question about pay equality). Recently, however, it seems these traditionally perceived “boys’ club” sectors are experiencing a disruption, not because the “boys” are opening the doors, but due in part to more opportunities for women to learn how to better promote themselves.</p>\n<p>In the media sector, the numbers are the story. According to the <a href=\"http://www.grady.uga.edu/annualsurveys/Enrollment_Survey/Enrollment_2013/2013EnrollCombined.pdf\"><em>2013 Annual Survey of Journalism and Mass Communication Enrollment</em></a>, two-thirds of the students enrolled in journalism programs nationwide are women, but they have still been underrepresented in the newsroom for many years, especially at the executive and management levels.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Hosted by the Film &amp; Media Studies Dept., the speakers not only emphasized the growing roles of women in the entertainment and media industries but also offered attendees tips and insights for pursuing careers in technology, film, television and media.</p>\n<p>The conference kicked off Saturday with Sara Caputo, founder of the consulting and training business Radiant Organizing, moderating a panel called “Taking Charge,” featuring human resource expert Karen Boublis, jeweler and online marketing strategist Calla Gold, negotiation consultant and executive coach Lisa Gates and public speaker Lisa Braithwaite.</p>\n<p>Besides maintaining authenticity during networking sessions, distinguishing between assertiveness and aggressiveness, achieving confidence, framing strengths and skill sets into value propositions and negotiating, “Taking Charge” offered guidance on how to make, keep and utilize industry connections. Not only were the speakers excited to share their advice, they also understood that networking, while essential in the entertainment sector known for “who you know,” does not come naturally.</p>\n<p>“If you’re uncomfortable with starting a conversation, do what I do — I give away gifts!” said Gold as she tossed small bags into the audience. “Now there’s a conversation starter for ya, but be sure your card is part of that gift, and don’t be shy talking about what you do and asking them what they do.” Sure enough, a business card for Calla Gold Jewelry along with a pair of earring backs were found in the bag.</p>\n<p>Although mastering the art of negotiation, networking and self-presentation is a major key to success, knowing one’s core values and ambitions is crucial since they help an individual navigate the career path. Sheila Sullivan, associate director of the Carsey-Wolf Center, helped students tackle this subject in “How To Get There.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the session, Sullivan directed attendees’ attention to the job interview: organizing and explaining a variety of interview questions, providing tips on how to stand out and emphasizing the importance of researching the desired position, interviewee, business and industry. As practice, volunteers from the audience would sit in the “hot seat” in the front of the room, where Sullivan ran through some practice interview questions and gave tips on how to improve afterward.</p>\n<p>“It reminded me of doing theater in high school, except instead of workshopping a scene, it was my life,” said second-year communication major Shanna Benji, who was the first to volunteer. “It was a little bit nerve-wracking, but I think it was beneficial to me in the long run. I’m glad it was done in there instead of with an actual interview.”</p>\n<p>Succeeding Sullivan was Kathy Wertheim, a certified fundraising executive teaching people “how to ask for money and get it.” While elaborating on the conference’s running themes of networking and negotiation, she stressed the importance of developing confidence in all aspects of career development.</p>\n<p>“People will take advantage of you ’cause you’re nice,” Wertheim said. “If you can move a little bit off of ‘nice,’ it helps enormously. The world doesn’t collapse when you’re direct.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Breaking In </strong></p>\n<p>The final panel of the day, “You Do What!?!,” featured publicist and crowdfunding consultant Brittany Sandler, newly hired assistant to “Vinyl” showrunner Scott Z. Burns, Brittany Vu, anonymous content attorney Laura Foody, editor Andulka “Annie” Wilkes, set lighting technician and best boy electric Stephanie Choi and cinematographer Lauren Haroutunian. The UCSB alumni discussed how to break into the entertainment industry’s production and creative sides and also touched upon Hollywood’s gender myths, particularly one regarding the lack of interested women in this “friends’ club” or “boys’ club.”</p>\n<p>“One of the things I’ve noticed,” Haroutunian said, “is that when they say, ‘We’re looking to hire X, Y and Z,’ they send it out to their buds, and then they’re like, ‘No women applied. Why did no women apply? Well, we tried.’”</p>\n<p>“There are a ton of women hungry for work and fighting to get that work. If you really want to hire women, you have to go and find those women,” Haroutunian added.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Beyond College, What’s Your Story?</strong></p>\n<p>Wertheim returned for day two to present a crash course on “How To Adult.” From managing finances to work and personal relationships, Wertheim imparted words of wisdom to help students prepare for adult life after college. Attendees performed various exercises such as practicing the perfect handshake and participating in a “rejection party” where they received and gave rejections in a variety of hypothetical work-related situations.</p>\n<p>“Checking … checking … nobody’s bleeding on the floor,” Wertheim said, scanning the room after the rejection party broke up. “‘No’ didn’t kill you. Rejection isn’t fatal.”</p>\n<p>In the “Finding Your Voice” session, award-winning producer and educator Marie Cantin upheld that everyone had a story to tell, even though oftentimes it took large amounts of luck in an ongoing process to find it.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be different for every person,” Cantin said. “Some people have lots of stories to tell; some people only have one. Some people tell the same story over and over again.”</p>\n<p>Once people find their stories, the next step is to tell it. Maker Studios’ artists and repertoire specialist Hilary Michaels, YouTuber Holly Conrad, writer and artist Mia Resella and author Laura Horwitz (all former Gauchos) gave advice on building a unique voice, promoting one’s passion and staying genuine while interviewing for jobs.</p>\n<p>“If you are you and they’re looking for you, then you already got the job,” Resella said.</p>\n<p>The final panel of the weekend, titled “Leading Ladies,” was moderated by journalist Starshine Roshell and featured Karen Horne, senior vice president of programming talent development and inclusion for NBC Entertainment and Universal Television Studios, along with television writers Jane Espenson and Anne Cofell Saunders. When asked if being a woman brought anything unique to writing, show running or executive production, Saunders responded that she doesn’t think of herself as a woman while working.</p>\n<p>“I don’t self-actualize myself before I pitch, ‘I’m pitching this as a woman,’” Saunders said. “I just pitch it as myself.”</p>\n<p>Still, the panelists recognized that diversity plays a crucial role in the business and in storytelling.</p>\n<p>“It’s diversity of experience, not just diversity in gender or sexual diversity,” Horne said. “If we have those differences of experiences, it makes us much richer storytellers.”</p>\n<p>Overall, WIM was a fantastic event full of informative and practical sessions and activities that not only addressed the state of Hollywood’s gender gap, but also how to prepare for the work and adult life that awaits after college.</p>\n<p>Kirsten “Cookie” Pierre, who is part of the WIM planning committee, is certain that WIM will continue after this year.</p>\n<p>“We hope that more people hear about the new event from all majors and participate next year, since everything shared will be helpful for not just women and men going into the film industry, but everyone!” Pierre said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Still an Uphill Battle but Making Progress</strong></p>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/CARDReport%20FINAL%2022216.ashx\">USC Study</a> finds that while about half of the film school graduates are women, they directed only 1.9 percent of the highest grossing 100 films in the period from 2013 to 2014.</p>\n<p>At UCSB, according to film &amp; media academic advisor Joe Palladino, roughly 53 percent of the department’s enrollment is comprised of women. In acting as a loose advisor for WIM, Palladino recognized that women had a very big presence in the department at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a time in the department where a lot of the student clubs — the Filmmakers’ Co-op, the Writers Room, Reel Loud, The Limitless Coalition — were all being run by women,” Palladino said.</p>\n<p>He adds, “We look at representations in the Oscars, representations of directors that are out there making feature films … It’s not good. We need to change.”</p>\n<p>In 2010, Kathryn Bigelow made history when she became the first woman to win an Academy Award for Best Director for “The Hurt Locker,” which follows an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in the Iraq War.</p>\n<p>When “Zero Dark Thirty” was released in 2012, it was not just an enthralling account of the CIA’s operation to eliminate Osama Bin Ladin, but also another breakthrough for women in Hollywood. Helmed by Bigelow, this Oscar nominated spy thriller was also led by main star Jessica Chastain, whose character is a composite of real female agents at the CIA (another “boys’ club” bastion) and overseen by Amy Pascal, who was then president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, parent company of “Zero Dark Thirty’s” film distributor Columbia Pictures.</p>\n<p>So, it’s safe to say in the 21st century, it’s a poor excuse to say qualified women are none to be found, as they are everywhere in big numbers and ready to go.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

His performances and songs are still iconic today, and new waves of fans continue to admire his music with each generation.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, KCSB presented “Starman Under the Stars,” a tribute to Bowie’s legacy and the wide range of his talents. KCSB advisor and DJ Ted Coe explained, “KCSB has been doing the Sound and Vision series which has incorporated a week of special programing over the airwaves commemorating the life and work of David Bowie.”</p>\n<p>Part of the series was a double feature film screening on the lawn of the lagoon to celebrate two films starring the late performer. The first film, met with shouts of excitement, was “Labyrinth.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With its fairytale story infused with unnerving, gritty imagery,<em> “</em>Labyrinth” is a unique and stylized film that plays with the mysteriousness of fantasy. The film is dripping with ’80s cheesiness from the songs sung by puppets to the teased craziness that is Bowie’s hair. It’s these elements, however, that have made “Labyrinth” an ’80s icon, and no element of the film proves that more than David Bowie himself.</p>\n<p>Bowie’s role as the Goblin King perfectly melds the dramatics of his stage performances with the mysterious magic of the fantasy world. Bowie’s first appearance in the film clearly announces his presence as he stands sinisterly in a doorway, arms and dark flowing cape outstretched as thunder cracks behind him. A dusting of sparkles emitting from his direction adds the finishing touch of rock ‘n’ roll magic. Bowie commands each scene he is in with a smooth, confident tone, a calculating gaze and an occasional mysterious smirk that intimidates and beguiles.</p>\n<p>Bowie’s music throughout the film creates an otherworldly tone while still maintaining his signature style of rock. “Magic Dance” is catchy and upbeat with bursts of synthesizer and memorable lyrics about the magic and mystical. Bowie’s quick dance moves and taunting attitude showcase delightfully evil antics. “Within You” conveys a much more threatening tone, demonstrating the range of Bowie’s character and his own musical style. The beginning of the song is jarring and ominous, with sharp drum beats and guitar to match the sudden, terrifying appearance of the Goblin King and his quick, determined pace.</p>\n<p>The screen isn’t the only place Bowie’s talent shines. His performance in film is only matched by his presence on stage. The next film, “Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,” provides a look at Bowie’s eclectic performance style and music. The concert film highlights Bowie’s last performance as his Ziggy Stardust stage persona.</p>\n<p>Bowie’s vocal talent is clear in every song. The quick tempo of “Moonage Daydream” is accented by Bowie’s whispery low tones and clear high notes. Members of the audience are shown excitedly singing along as he holds out high notes and speaks toward them during the breaks in his songs. At the end of “Ziggy Stardust,” he pauses dramatically in front of the microphone in silence before belting out the last note of the song in a strong voice that commands attention.</p>\n<p>The iconic performances in this film show the unique way Bowie blended theatrics with music. At the beginning of “Time,” he appears with his arms outstretched with long, elegant white sleeves as two people suddenly rip his robe off of him to reveal a skin-tight, elaborately patterned bodysuit complete with a bright blue feather boa. In each song, he engages directly with the audience, pointing toward them dramatically and singing to various people.</p>\n<p>Andrew Kenny, a second-year and Bowie fan, said of the film, “I’m glad it wasn’t a normal documentary, because I’ve already seen two on him, so I don’t think there would have been too much new stuff to learn. It was fun to just sit through essentially like an entire concert experience.”</p>\n<p>David Bowie remains an important icon in music, movies and performance, and KCSB’s tribute only confirmed the appreciation and admiration of fans of all ages. From the magic of “Labyrinth” to the cool confidence of Ziggy Stardust, Bowie’s range of styles and performances is as impressive as it is entertaining. “Starman Under the Stars” proved that David Bowie is a star that will never fade.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71472\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/kcsb-pays-bowie-tribute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71472\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/kcsb-pays-bowie-tribute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/kcsb-pays-bowie-tribute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/kcsb-pays-bowie-tribute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/kcsb-pays-bowie-tribute/","id":5877,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[5876,5875,5874],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"True Life: UCSB Thinks I’m A Woman?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/14-2-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/14-2-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A classic mix-up forces Jonathan Rodgers to explain to Student Health why he cannot, in fact, get pregnant.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After I made the decision to attend UCSB, one of my first interactions with our school’s administration was a rather strange one. Following standard protocol, I had enrolled with the campus Resident Halls Association for a dorm room several months in advance of my first academic quarter. However, I was soon met with a particularly odd problem: For some reason (and I’ve never been able to resolve how this happened) the RHA had me listed in their student database as being female.</p>\n<p>Now, in certain situations and circumstances this would not have been an issue, but in my personal case this represented quite a problem. This is perhaps the appropriate place in this story for me to mention that I am not a woman. Since birth I have been and have considered myself male, both by sex and by gender identity. Additionally, I have a name which leaves no ambiguity as to my gender, and my physical features could not even be described as epicene.</p>\n<p>This particular inaccuracy on the part of the housing authority presented me with quite a dilemma, as roommate assignments are generally categorized by sex. What I anticipated was that once my secret was discovered, I would have to be reassigned to a different dorm — the possible result being that I would receive a less desirable room, as this would occur after assignments had been completed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a few minutes of contemplation, I decided to call the RHA office and explain the issue: “Signed up for housing; am not female; never have been female, etc.” Laughter came across the telephone line.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t mind being in your situation,” chuckled the masculine voice on the other end of the call.</p>\n<p>Within a few minutes the problem was rectified, and despite this small mistake, I then went on to have a fairly auspicious academic year.</p>\n<p>Though not a particularly significant event in my life, I never imagined that this occurrence would serve as a quasi-prelude to a more recent quandary which I (and also other students, from what I’ve been told) have been met with.</p>\n<p>Several weeks ago, I received an email of a particularly odd nature from Student Health Services. Now, normally when I receive emails where the subject title begins with “IMPORTANT,” I am nearly always correct in my assumption that the contents of the message will be hopelessly boring. Usually I’m able to ignore these, at least for a little while. However, in this instance, I felt a strong urge to unveil the contents of the message immediately — a result of feeling a bit miffed by this sudden end to a serene two weeks of not receiving any emails from the Student Health office.</p>\n<p>The email contained a cursory message about my health insurance coverage. You see, I — like many other students — have my own insurance plan with an outside provider, and therefore I elect to not be provided with (charged for) health insurance by the university, a health plan which they automatically enroll you in (charge you for) unless you fill out this waiver with a bunch of esoteric insurance questions at the start of the school year. As you are probably aware, all UCSB students are required to have health insurance, a policy which I will fully endorse, as long as there are roundabouts on the campus bike path. (That we force freshmen to attend orientation workshops warning of the dangers of substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases and mental illness but leave the roundabouts unaddressed has always seemed puzzling to me.)</p>\n<p>What made this particular missive interesting was not the curt wording in the body of the message informing me that I’d had my waiver audited and rejected, but rather what was contained within the file attached to the email: a document which informed me that I was to be enrolled in (charged for) the campus health insurance program against my will. Following this edict was a very specific explanation as to why Student Health Services had determined that my outside insurance provider was inadequate:</p>\n<p>“According to your insurance carrier, your plan does not provide you with coverage for maternity care. (Required for both male and female — California state law there be no [sic] gender-specific limitations).”</p>\n<p>This was the solitary reason listed for the insufficiency of my health care provider and for my impending enrollment into UCSB’s insurance program for the paltry sum of $804.57 per academic quarter.</p>\n<p>Though I have frequently been hailed as an individual with a fair distribution of talents and abilities, I’ve often been told that when it comes to pregnancy, I just don’t have it in me. In fact, I’ve lived most of my life under the impression that people like me (you know, men) have a certain deficiency when it comes to child-bearing. (You may recall the old anecdote about the clergyman who, when asked by a precocious woman to define the key difference between men and women, simply replied “Madam, I cannot conceive.”)</p>\n<p>A few days later, at the conclusion of what might have been the most bizarre phone call of my life, I was reassured by a representative of my insurance company that in the event that I were to ever devise some way of achieving pregnancy, the maternity costs would indeed be covered by my policy. After receiving this confirmation, I then proceeded to the Student Health office to receive some answers regarding my needless and involuntary conscription into the student health insurance program.</p>\n<p>After locating and entering the appropriate office, I sat opposite a student health representative and detailed my complaints: “waiver revoked; maternity coverage; am a man; can’t give birth; wouldn’t want to even if I could,” and so on. Stopping just short of explicitly explaining how human reproduction operates, I ceased talking and waited for a response from the official across from me. Having remained relatively expressionless for the duration of my remarks, you would have thought I’d been discussing the weather rather than how blatantly absurd it is to postulate that a male student needs maternity insurance coverage.</p>\n<p>I later learned that the health representative’s dispassionate demeanor during our conversation wasn’t due to indifference, but rather that the office had recently been experiencing an influx of other students with identical complaints. It was explained to me that the gender-neutrality policy is part of a series of reforms within the state to accommodate the impending implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>After I explained that my health provider had confirmed their willingness to cover any costs incurred in the highly unlikely event that I become pregnant, I was then told that I would be able to once again waive out of the campus insurance program. I am quite thankful to the health staff for allowing me this concession. In the end, the decision to let me disengage myself from the program most likely saved their resources. Especially considering that since being notified of the $1,600 I would have had to pay in insurance fees for the remainder of the year, I had begun to entertain the idea of scheduling regular gynecology appointments at the health office, feigning ignorance when told that there must be some sort of misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Much has been said in the past year about the recent changes in the campus insurance policy, the discussion of which is frequently centered on the almost two-fold increase in costs to undergraduate students. However, I think it is important to note that these additional costs have also been accompanied by additional benefits. Perhaps the most notable of these is the removal of a “maximum benefits amount,” something which is highly beneficial for students who are diagnosed with a severe illness.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it has often seemed as though the campus has been quite pushy in selling their product. Students accessing the waiver to opt out of the campus insurance program are met with what is essentially tactical advertising: statements asserting the alleged value of being “double-insured” by buying into the program. And had I not paid attention and challenged my position, I very easily could’ve been enlisted in the program.</p>\n<p>There is a distinct difference between the mere offering of a product to a person and the active coercion of its purchase. These points of difference fall on the opposite sides of a line ­— the demarcation which marks the disparity between having a choice in purchasing what you realistically could have a need for, and the mandated subscription to a product which one could never realistically use.</p>\n<p><em>Jonathan Rodgers wants you to know that he’s completely and totally secure in his lack of female parts, and the fact that he can quote lines from Mean Girls is a completely unrelated matter.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, February 12, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
