Greitens is also a Rhodes Scholar, a White House Fellow and founder and CEO of The Mission Continues, a non-profit organization which challenges veterans to serve and lead in communities across the country.</p>\n<p>Throughout the lecture, Greitens focused on how to grow from personal experiences, stating that growth is necessary to move on from past hardship.</p>\n<p>“You cannot bounce back from hardship. You can only move through it,” Greitens said. “No one escapes pain, fear, and suffering. Yet from pain can come wisdom; from fear can come courage; and from suffering can come strength — if we have the value of resilience.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through – Eric Greitens</p></blockquote>\n<p>Greitens also discussed the importance of meeting obstacles in order to progress in life and said that, as Navy SEALS, he and his colleagues understood the word “frontline” to mean “the place where we met the enemy,” but frontline is not just a “military term.”</p>\n<p>“In fact, you have a frontline in your life now,” Greitans said. “Everyone has a place where they encounter fear, where they struggle, suffer, and face hardship. … It is on the frontline of our lives that we earn wisdom, create joy, forge friendships, discover happiness, find love and do purposeful work.”</p>\n<p>According to Greitens, the most important factor in dealing with hardship is figuring out to work through life’s challenges.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a place in life where they have to deal with hardship and challenge and pain and difficulty fear,” Greitens said. “But it’s often our ability to navigate those places — of hardship and difficulty — that grow essential to our ability to live life in a purpose, productive and meaningful way.”</p>\n<p>Greitens said he believes resilience is a way of working through hardship rather than returning to a state of being prior to experiencing hardship.</p>\n<p>“When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through,” Greitens said. “Resilient people do not bounce back from hard experiences. They find healthy ways to integrate them into their lives. In time, people can confront great calamity with great spirit and can create great strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major at Golden West College in Huntington Beach Nick Wolfe said he traveled to Goleta, CA., from Anaheim to hear Greitens speak.</p>\n<p>“I’m a fan of his work,” Wolfe said. “I’ve read his past book <em>The Heart and The Fis</em>t and I’ve acquired his other book, which is pretty similar.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience. But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. – Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wolfe said he was considering joining the military before he sustained a personal injury, but still enjoys learning about Greitens’ military career.</p>\n<p>“I’ve read the book already and some of the things he did say were verbatim,” Wolfe said. “But he did hit a lot of the more important topics harder on the head as he felt necessary and it was nice to hear it in his voice for the first time. That was awesome. I have respect for humanity and life in general and the way he approaches and sees it is really fascinating. Really, it’s respectable.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Herman Li said he attended Greitens’ lecture because of his prior training experience with the United States Marine Corps. According to Li, the lecture was more successful and influenced him more than previous, similar events he has attended.</p>\n<p>“I just thought his advice on getting through pain and suffering was really good … to build resilience,” Li said. “I wasn’t expecting this many people because I went to an event a few weeks ago where a marine was speaking and there was only like ten people.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Patrick Mossman said he attended the lecture to learn more about the military.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in joining Army ROTC [Reserve Officers’ Training Corps] here and I just decided to come because I thought it would be interesting hearing from someone, especially a Navy SEAL,” Mossman said. “He had a lot of interesting things to say. I definitely learned some things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin said hearing Greitens speak was as an impactful learning experience.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience,” Franklin said. “But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. I liked his ideas of growing from what we have experienced. He said something like, ‘What happens to us becomes a part of us’ and that really resonated with me.”</p>\n<p>According to Franklin, Greiten’s idea of “segmenting,” or breaking work assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks, was helpful.</p>\n<p>“That’s helpful in everyday life,” Franklin said. “As students, and a lot of us with jobs, we have busy lives that can seem overwhelming. So I’ll be using this segmenting advice in my life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/","id":2841,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2840,2839,2838],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt","biography":"Not available","articles":[2748,2775,2793,2841,2883,4721,4748,4767,4770],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Lecture Talks About Reintroducing Extinct Animals","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Conservation-Talk_Brendan-Mansfield-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Conservation-Talk_Brendan-Mansfield-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) hosted a talk on the possibilities of resurrecting extinct life by Oliver A.

Ryder, Director of the San Diego Zoo’s Frozen Zoo Project and Chair of the Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, delivers a talk on reviving extinct species.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) hosted a talk on the possibilities of resurrecting extinct life by Oliver A. Ryder titled “Conservation, De-Extinction, and the Future of Life” in the HSSB McCune Conference Room on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Ryder is the Director of the Frozen Zoo Project at the San Diego Zoo’s Institute for Conservation Research, a project that freezes cell samples and DNA from over half a million endangered organisms in an effort to save species coming close to extinction.</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, there is increased global concern for conservation and he is disappointed in the United States’ lack of participation in international conservation treaties.</p>\n<p>“The international community is making goals to provide standards and higher expectations to express these problems on a global basis,” Ryder said. “Our country is one of the great minority in the world that has not participated in the discussion since we did sign the Convention [on] Biological Diversity. We have a major role to play in the involvement of these discussions one way or another.”</p>\n<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity is a multilateral international treaty signed in 1992 by over 150 countries across the world pledging a commitment to ensure conservation of biological diversity within their borders. As of 2014, the U.S. has signed but not ratified the conditions of the 1992 agreement.</p>\n<p>Ryder said the now extinct Hawaiian po’o-uli bird was been studied in the Frozen Zoo Project using cells of the bird from previously acquired genetic samples.</p>\n<p>“[The Po’ouli bird] is a real just a tragic story and a prime example of dysfunction,” Ryder said. “However we were able to receive some DNA of the species before the bird died and we were able to grow some living cells out of it. It was a surreal experience. How the cells are growing vivaciously and seeing the chromosomes being created and just knowing the organism is gone.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, in 1987 conservationists counted the amount of California Condors and found a shockingly low total population of about 20 birds. Participants took samples of and tagged each individual bird and found they were struggling to survive due to lead pollution, according to Ryder who participated in the project.</p>\n<p>“We used DNA fingerprinting on 23 condors and found each Condor to only three clans and found they have a genetic disease, like a lethal dwarfism that prevented chicks from hatching, resulting from lead in the environment,” Ryder said. “As a result of that, Governor Brown signed a bill banning lead bullets, but California is the only state to do this even though the condor is present in Arizona and Utah.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said one of the biggest success stories is of the black-footed ferret, which was thought to have been extinct but reappeared in Wyoming in 1981. Seven of the ferrets brought to captivity reproduced successfully using artificial semen, a process that increases genetic diversity.</p>\n<p>“Currently, all 8,000 ferrets in captivity came from seven individuals,” Ryder said. “We received skin biopsies samples from ferrets who were alive earlier to create artificial semen. The semen was then used on the seven individuals who gave birth to ferrets that now have more genetic diversity, which will help the overall survival of the black footed ferret species.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, the only way to help increase genetic diversity of endangered animals is by cloning, which he considers an expensive procedure.</p>\n<p>“Cloning is the only way to do it,” Ryder said. “However this is used as a model for cystic fibrosis research. There are ferrets who are given the gene for the human form of cystic fibrosis that are then used as test subjects for medication treatment. They can take the ferret cell but it costs about $50,000 to $150,000.”</p>\n<p>Ryder said the San Diego Zoo is attempting to use Frozen Zoo Project samples to save the only five remaining northern white rhinoceros, but that saving the animals will not be enough to save the species if the rhinos do not breed.</p>\n<p>“We took some cells from one of the rhinos and grew stem cells from them, which can make any cells in the body,” Ryder said. “Theoretically we can save the white rhinos, however the rhinos aren’t repopulating. There are five walking around, but if there is no offspring, they might as well be extinct already.”</p>\n<p>According to Ryder, future generations are raised with notions of potentially saving endangered species, and must decide the future of manipulating genomes.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to watch movies like ‘Ice Age’ because it assaults everything we know about DNA and genes, but this is the world our children are growing up in,” Ryder said. “They’re growing up believing this is possible, and it might be, but it’s up to them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Bree Brydenthal said she believes scientists need to work purposefully when conducting research and should consider whether their work will benefit the community.</p>\n<p>“I think the question that has to be asked is what is the point of them branching out to bring these animals into a world we don’t need them in,” Brydenthal said. “Is it beneficial to our current ecosystem or will it have serious environmental consequences? I think we have to determine what place it will have.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Brianna Acuesta said freezing samples could lead to moral debates among researchers and the general public.</p>\n<p>“In terms of morality, it’s the issues that come up of this topic,” Acuesta said. “People are talking about cloning or bringing back animals that necessarily don’t have a place in our world right now. But also we’re not talking about mammoths, we’re talking about species such as the passenger pigeon too.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62032\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62032\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/lecture-talks-about-reintroducing-extinct-animals/","id":2838,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2837,2836,2835],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Program Board commissioner Ben Simons urged students to attend university-sponsored events during Deltopia this weekend.</p>\n<p>Member of the UCSB chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) Anumita Kaur sponsored a bill that would voice the Senate’s support to stop UC investments and contracts with businesses allegedly profiting from human rights abuses in conflict areas in Israel and Palestine and said students’ tuition is funding to these corporations.</p>\n<p>“When you pay your tuition, you are investing in corporations and currently those corporations are profiting off of apartheid and profiting off of occupation,” Kaur said. “All this bill means is that we do not agree with that.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major and SJP member Shahryar Mooraj spoke to the Senate about injustices committed against the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>“The fact is that Palestinians living in Gaza, in lands disputed with Israel, live in an apartheid state,” Mooraj said. “On a daily basis they are subjected to Israeli policies such as segregated bus lines, the continuation of illegal settlement building, home demolitions [and] housing discrimination.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61960\" style=\"width: 346px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61960\" data-attachment-id=\"61960\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/a-s-senate-meeting-discusses-uc-divestment-anti-semitism/senate_lorenzo-basilio-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=600%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,454\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1427875777\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_Lorenzo Basilio-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=600%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61960\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=336%2C254\" alt=\"Senators listen as students voice their opinions during public forum.

External Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Senator Michelle Moreh then introduced a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and said she introduced the resolution “to raise awareness about the outgrowth of hatred of Jews around the world.”</p>\n<p>“We still have swastikas being spray-painted on Jewish fraternities at other UC schools, we still have students denying the right to exist of the only Jewish state in the world and we still have a candidate for UCLA’s judicial board being discriminated against on the basis of her Jewish identity,” Moreh said. “We still have flyers posted around UCSB blaming the Jews for 9/11.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Muslim Students Association (MSA) President and fourth-year biochemistry major Yasmin Sallak said she supports the bill and noted there is a distinction between anti-Semitism and criticism of the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>“I want to do my part to make sure that Jewish students feel safe expressing their identity,” Sallak said. “When speaking about Israel I’d like to point out, just as the resolution does, that there is a significant difference between criticizing the being of Israel and critiquing Israeli policy.”</p>\n<p>The resolution to condemn anti-Semitism passed with a vote of 23-0 with one abstention from second-year economics and accounting major and Senator Steven Kwok.</p>\n<p>Simons outlined all of the on-campus events Program Board has scheduled to minimize the amount of students in Isla Vista during Deltopia weekend and said students should attend the events to encourage administrators to support similar alternative programming in the future.</p>\n<p>“This needs to be a success in order for us to continue doing stuff like this,” Simons said. “There is no way the university will allow us to create events like this if this one is not successful.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the University of California Isla Vista (UCIV) volunteer program will help facilitate Deltopia and the lawful conduction of festivities this weekend.</p>\n<p>“These students are acting as an independent body,” Schunk said. “This year, UCSB is taking ownership over I.V. and what happens in it.”</p>\n<p>The program currently consists of around 50 students and three Greek organizations. UCIV is still accepting volunteers, who will receive free shirts and food if they participate, and will be holding an orientation Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“UCIV is a volunteer program,” Schunk said. “Every volunteer will have a backpack with water bottles, maps with all the locations and know where the water stations and resources are.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the problems surrounding Deltopia partially stem from distrust between law enforcement and students.</p>\n<p>“The status quo is there is a lack of trust in student responsibility,” Schunk said. “We are hoping for a better bank of student-police interactions.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said more planning and precautions were taken this year as a result of Deltopia last spring, and next week plans will be made for the 2016 Deltopia based off the weekend event.</p>\n<p>“There was a lack of momentum last year,” Schunk said. “Everyone stepped back and said, ‘Wow that’s terrible that happened, we should never let that happen again’ but the conversation ended there. In addition, the week following will be a week of action and discussion. So what this week will focus on is discussion forums for solutions about problems we face this year and what to fix … or what went right and what we should expand upon.”</p>\n<p>Schunk then moved on to discuss the progress of I.V. self-governance bill AB 3 and said the preliminary report for financing the bill is set to be completed by the end of May and the full report to be finished by July.</p>\n<p>“We are getting financial feasibility,” Schunk said. “It will answer the question, ‘Do we have the money to move forward with self-governance?’ … It’s really good to see the community working together to provide benefit and support.”</p>\n<p>Senate ended with brief updates on the upcoming installation of vending machines on campus and the progression of redesigning student ACCESS cards.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 the Thursday, April 2, 2015 print edition.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article incorrectly reported the location of today’s AS External Affairs Committee meeting as the Goleta Valley room of the UCen.

The committee will revisit the resolution at its next meeting next Thursday.</p>\n<p>The controversial resolution calls on the university, ASUCSB, the UCSB Foundation and UC Regents to divest from companies selling equipment to the Israeli government for use in “Israel’s military occupation and siege of the Palestinian territories.” The resolution specifically names Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon, Motorola, Caterpillar and General Electric as companies that should have profited due to their sale of various pieces of equipment to the Israeli government including biometric scanners, engines for Apache helicopters and various guided missiles.</p>\n<p>The resolution cites the UC’s historic disinvestment from South Africa over its apartheid policies as precedent for continued divestment from companies doing business with Israel.</p>\n<p>“ASUCSB will examine its assets and UC assets for investments in companies that a) provide military support for, or weaponry to support, the occupation of the Palestinian Territories, or b) facilitate the building or maintenance of the Separation Wall or the demolition of Palestinian homes, or c) facilitate in the building, maintenance, or economic development of Israeli settlements on annexed Palestinian territories,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major, Students for Justice in Palestine member and co-author of the divestment resolution Anumita Kaur read the language of the resolution calling for the university to take action.</p>\n<p>“Let it finally be resolved that we the students call upon our university to disassociate itself from companies that promote systematic discrimination, inequality and human rights violations,” Kaur said. “Where this system targets people based on religion, gender, race orientation by divesting in companies that participate in or profit from human rights violations.”</p>\n<p>Kaur also said it is distressing for students to know that their funds are being invested in companies engaged in military activities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>“Knowing that our money is going to companies that provide missiles, going to companies that bulldoze homes, going to companies that provide surveillance systems and biometric systems that are used to restrict freedom of movement — wrong,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Second-year biopsychology major Niki Elyasi said the divestment resolution would do nothing to address the flaws in Israeli state policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that being pro-Israel means that you love Israel for all its flaws, because Israel does have flaws, but I don’t think that means that a resolution like this will solve those flaws at all,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>Kaur summarized her perspective of the goal of the divestment movement toward the end of her presentation and said, “We are just trying to wash the blood off our hands.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh spoke in favor of some of the more controversial aspects of Israeli policy addressed in the resolution, such as the military blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been in effect since 2007.</p>\n<p>“The reason there is an imposed blockade is because terrorists smuggle weapons into Gaza before that have been used directly to attack Israeli citizens, Moreh said. “If Israel does not restrain to a certain level what goes into Gaza, its citizens are in critical danger.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and economics double major Guy Singer said he is opposed to the passage of the divestment resolution because it does not include any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“I want the Jewish community to be involved in some way, and they have not been. In fact, having to take this on this week has been a complete surprise to all of us,” Singer said. “What I’m here to suggest is we vote this bill down, we form an ad hoc committee of certain representatives from certain communities to put forward a bill that addresses the various needs of the communities.”</p>\n<p>Second-year physics major Senator Liam Stanton said he was in favor of tabling the bill for next week and anticipated it will be voted on eventually by the full Senate.</p>\n<p>“Either tabling it here or tabling it in big Senate, sending it there and then tabling it, is the appropriate thing to do, regardless of which side of the resolution you go on,” Stanton said. “I think of course it will get to big Senate.”</p>\n<p>After further debate and discussion a proposal was made to table the motion for one week, with five of the six senators voting in favor and one opposed vote from Moreh, the motion passed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62002\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/a-s-senate-committee-tables-divestment-talks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62002\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/a-s-senate-committee-tables-divestment-talks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/a-s-senate-committee-tables-divestment-talks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/a-s-senate-committee-tables-divestment-talks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/a-s-senate-committee-tables-divestment-talks/","id":2840,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2839,2838,2837],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
