The 40 wins was a new record for most wins against Division I opponents in a season.

This is because a record 10 of his players were drafted last year, including pitcher Dillon Tate, who was drafted fourth overall by the Texas Rangers. UCSB has the second-most draftees of any team in the country, only trailing Oklahoma’s 11 players drafted.</p>\n<p>“There has been a lot of turnover on the roster,” Checketts said. “However, we are returning some key pieces.”</p>\n<p>These key pieces include outfielder Andrew Calica and pitcher Shane Bieber. Calica is a career .321 hitter at the Division I level, while Bieber earned an All-Big West Second Team nod after co-leading the Big West in wins with 8 and a solid 2.24 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I’m counting on them [Calica and Beiber],” Checketts said. “They’re Friday night starters and have experience, including playing in regionals last year.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are also going to count on younger pieces such as sophomores Clay Fisher and Kyle Nelson. Fisher, an infielder, racked up 43 hits and 19 RBI’s, which were both seventh best on the team. Nelson, a left-handed pitcher, went 3-1 with a 0.75 ERA out of the bullpen to earn Freshman All-America honors.</p>\n<p>“We are new in some spots and we are excited for the younger players,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to see its new roster do some good things against a San Francisco squad who finished 23-31 last season. They ended the season on a seven game losing streak, meaning they will be excited to take the field against UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Dons are looking to players like infielder Dan James to lead the team this year. The junior had a .346 batting average, which was second best on the team. They will also look to former 2014 West Coast Conference All-Freshman Team Nico Giarratano. The junior hit a respectable .220 average in his 32 games.</p>\n<p>The new Santa Barbara line-up is what will have most people excited this season. After losing the aforementioned 10 players to the draft, it will be interesting to see how new players feel in their roles.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lot of question marks,” Checketts said. “There are still a lot of moving parts and we still are not sure of our exact lineup. We want to find ourselves and our identity, and it will take some time, but we are excited.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s season opener is at 2 p.m. Friday, Feb. 19 against San Francisco at Caeser Uyesaka stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

During a goat yoga class, goats interact with participants by jumping on participants’ backs or snuggling on the yoga mat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goat yoga class in I.V. will be held at the Santa Barbara Hillel this upcoming Saturday, Dec. 2, at 11 a.m. A maximum of 50 people are allowed in the class, and the class will cost $40 per participant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Bahar, a second-year undeclared major and host of the event, said goat yoga is more beneficial than regular yoga because the interaction with goats releases endorphins, which stimulates a positive feeling in the body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It connects you to the people around you and provides a friendly atmosphere,” Bahar said. “It is more than zen and more of an experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar grew up in Los Angeles and said he discovered goat yoga last August. He was on a waitlist for three months before he could participate because there is only one studio in Los Angeles that offers the unique yoga class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an amazing experience and a crazy wild adrenaline rush. You are just surrounded by people having a good time,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar said he wanted to bring goat yoga to I.V. because UCSB students “stress out and don’t find time for themselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahar contacted a farm in Sun Valley, Calif. that brings certified goats to yoga events. It is “fairly expensive” to bring this experience to Isla Vista, Bahar said, but he expects a good turnout at the class.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga was created by Lainey Morse, a goat owner from Albany, Oreg. Morse was encouraged by a local yoga instructor to connect her love of goats with the practice of yoga. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goat yoga is animal-assisted therapy, according to Morse’s </span><a href=\"https://goatyoga.net/about/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and is an “unbelievable distraction” from work, politics or sickness.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not Bahar’s first time helping students destress before finals. He also started a business called Party Ice which delivers ice cream sandwiches to residents in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall the week before midterms and finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Goat yoga is a step above Party Ice and is still a way to help people destress,” Bahar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those interested in signing up for goat yoga can email Bahar at </span><em><a href=\"mailto:ivgoatyoga@gmail.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivgoatyoga@gmail.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/goat-yoga-class-to-come-to-isla-vista/","id":4353,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[4352,4351,4350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Freebies and Activities in Isla Vista This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I.V. indie rock band Frisson will play their first show of the new school year on Saturday, Dec. 2 from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m at 6694 Del Playa Drive.
