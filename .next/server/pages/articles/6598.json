I was only 17 and still heavily invested in my indie and alternative roots, with bands like Arcade Fire and MGMT topping my personal list of must-see acts. As a young and naive festival-goer, I wasn’t too keen on checking out acts I was unfamiliar with. Nonetheless, I found myself with a gap between sets toward the end of Day 1 and decided to make the most of my time. So, I made my way to the nearest tent closest tent near me to pass the time.</p>\n<p>I found myself aimlessly stumbling into the darker and more intimate setting of Coachella’s Gobi Tent. It was then that I was introduced to Flume, hearing his track “Sleepless” for the first time. I had no idea who he was and had only managed to figure out his name after looking at my little booklet of set times, but what I do know is that whatever I was hearing, I liked it. I was instantly mesmerized by every weird and unfamiliar bit of sound I heard, so much so that I remained there for the next 30 minutes of his set.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“What is this?” I asked myself.</p>\n<p>Five years later and Flume has just released his newest project, Hi This Is Flume, a 17-track mixtape touting features from KUČKA, Eprom, JPEGMAFIA, SOPHIE, HWLS and slowthai and accompanied by a 42-minute-long visualizer directed by Jonathan Zawada. The Australian record producer, musician and DJ took to Instagram and Twitter earlier this month to announce the project, releasing it only a day laterin only a days time and breaking a painstaking two-year silence that has lasted since the release of the second companion EP to his Grammy award-winning album Skin in 2017.</p>\n<p>Flume, also known as Harley Streten, is notorious for consistently branching out into uncharted territory when it comes to his production. He is a pioneer in experimental electronic music and is largely responsible for launching the “future-bass” sound that dominates much of the mainstream music now. His sound design is an innovative and genre-blending mesh of sounds that one may not have ever heard before.</p>\n<p>Following his widely acclaimed Skin album in 2016, it’s hard to imagine how Flume could expand upon the weirdly alluring obscurities that make up his signature sound. When all has been watched and listened to, however, it’s evident that his newest project, Hi This Is Flume, stands as an even bigger career-defining moment in the scope of all things Flume.</p>\n<p>To my 17-year-old self, I’d confidently say, “This is Flume.”</p>\n<p>The mixtape opens up with an introductory “Hi, this is Flume” sample and transitions into a track titled “Ecdysis,” which quite literally is the process of shedding old skin among reptiles and insects. Metaphorically, this opening signals Flume’s own shedding of his “skin” — the evident narrative throughout the mixtape and visualizer. It’s a narrative of growth and moving forward, reaching newer and higher grounds.</p>\n<p>Filled with retro and hypnotic graphics among expansive landscapes, the visualizer accompanying the mixtape helps to guide audiences through this narrative journey Flume embarkssets out on. It’s psychedelic and trippy and helps accentuate every feature of the mixtape and its seamless transitions from track to track.</p>\n<p>Standout tracks in the first half include “Jewel” and “Dreamtime.” Both are somewhat reminiscent of the sounds in Flume’s prior work, particularly those in the two companion EPs to Skin. They’re nostalgic in nature and indicative of the mellow flow and glitchy sounds that helped propel Flume into the global spotlight, but still with new and heavier twists to them. The first run of tracks culminate in Flume and Eprom’s remix of SOPHIE’s “Is It Cold In The Water?” and builds on SOPHIE’s already ethereal and hyperreal sound.</p>\n<p>After several minutes of following Flume in his tie-dye kimono on his trek through the desert, the mixtape and visualizer pauses with a three-minute silence during which he is seen pumping gas late at night at an empty gas station. Then, it immediately transitions into “How To Build a Relationship,” featuring a strong and powerful verse from rapper JPEGMAFIA.</p>\n<p>This is where the real action of the project picks up — even fresher and newer sounds are poured into this side of the tape. “Wormhole,” for instance, is the most telling of all in terms of Flume’s growth and experimentation as a producer. It presents to listeners a seemingly random conglomeration of almost unbearable, loud noises until it bleeds into “Voices,” with appearances from SOPHIE and KUČKA. In “Voices,” we hear the same bashing of sounds, although in a much more fascinating way that’s layered beneath the vocals.</p>\n<p>“MUD” and “Upgrade” follow these tracks as an even more impressive pair of the strangely entrancing mixture of sounds Flume uses in his productions.<br>\nBut perhaps the best run of tracks is the 10 or so minutes engulfed by Tracks 13-17, from “71m3” to “Spring.” The visualizer shows Flume seeing double of himself, driving in circles and even burying himself in the sand. It’s a psychedelic realization and rebirth, quite literally depicted in this part of the visualizer and through the wonky, hard-soft melodies that bring these tracks together.</p>\n<p>In the end, Hi This Is Flume speaks true to its name. This is what Flume is. It’s the raw and organic feeling of hearing a sound for the very first time. It’s the discovery of something new — something you never knew you needed, until you did. It’s that feeling my 17-year-old self was overcome by when hearing the oddities of Flume’s production for the very first time and being strangely drawn to it because of its fresh and authentic nature.</p>\n<p>Hi This Is Flume is a mesmerizing testament to the process of discovery, growth and continuation. Whether it be in his personal life or creative processes, Flume is, and continues to be, a confident stride into the unknown. His originality as a producer is quite possibly what leads others to flock to his side, and not knowing what will come next perpetually leaves fans on their toes.</p>\n<p>What has always fascinated me about the electronic music genre is how electronic artists and producers are continually able to push the musical landscape, challenging traditional conceptions of what music is and what it ought to sound like. Throughout his career and especially through his new project, Flume has exemplified this to a tee, proving that music can and should be a continually progressive phenomenon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/","id":6598,"author":{"id":685,"name":"Austin Fauni"},"related":[6597,6596,6595],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":685,"name":"Austin Fauni","biography":"Not available","articles":[6598,6627],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"In Review: Weezer’s ‘The Teal Album’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2019-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/weezer-920x584.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/weezer-920x584.jpg?resize=920%2C584&ssl=1","description":"The Teal Album is lighthearted in spirit.

With a diverse discography running the gamut from the cacophonously angsty </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinkerton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the pristinely poppy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Album</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the band has had to deal with praise and criticism of every shape and color through the years. Following the musical civil war between artist and audience after the negative response of last year’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacific Daydream</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Teal Album</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the first entry in the postbellum period of Weezer’s discography, surprising fans with an entire album’s worth of covers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as I hit play, I found myself wearing the same smile on my face as I had in the fifth grade, when I first I heard the band singing about destroying sweaters. And even though the songs may not deviate too far from their source material, the album as a whole is still very much a Weezer album.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first four of the 10 songs on the tracklist harken back to ‘80s synthpop classics. The album opens, of course, with the song that started it all: Toto’s “Africa,” released in response to a meme account on Twitter jokingly begging the band for the cover. The band’s instrumentation handles the reins for the next two covers — Tears for Fears’ “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” and Eurhythmics’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” — with classic Weezerisms like chugged power chords and simple but punchy drum patterns blending in seamlessly with the songs’ synthpop edges. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But frontman Rivers Cuomo steals the spotlight in his rendition of a-ha’s “Take On Me,” particularly when he hits the chorus’s notorious high note (a nightmare for karaoke singers and audiences alike) with such natural effortlessness that I’m surprised we haven’t heard Cuomo show off his falsetto more often.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘80s nostalgia fades into the drug-addled music of the ‘60s and ‘70s, beginning with the album highlight “Happy Together,” which transforms the Turtles’ quirky psychedelic ditty into anthemic power pop. Cuomo shines yet again with his Beach Boys-like harmonies throughout the track, but the real star of the show here is rhythm guitarist Brian Bell, whose alternation between subtle licks and heavy walls of distortion give the song such a unique, grungy flavor that  it could probably pass as a Weezer song from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything Will Be Alright in the End</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This version of “Happy Together” distinguishes itself so well not only from the original, but also from the rest of the album’s pattern of carbon-copy covers, that it wins the silver medal out of the whole tracklist. (More on the gold medal later.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brian Bell continues his streak on the band’s version of Black Sabbath’s “Paranoid,” this time by temporarily stepping up to lead vocals with what sounds like a cross between Ozzy Osbourne and Patrick Stump, right before the band completely shifts the mood with a faithful rendition of ELO’s uplifting “Mr. Blue Sky.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gold medal I promised earlier undoubtedly goes to Weezer’s reimagination of TLC’s “No Scrubs.” Rivers Cuomo’s nasal voice and eccentric personality somehow fit perfectly with the band’s R&amp;B instrumentation, earning him the distinction of being possibly the only 48-year-old lead singer of a ‘90s rock band who can pull off bragging about “looking like class and he’s looking like trash.” I spent the first few seconds of the song wondering how this combo could possibly make sense; every second since then, I’ve been wondering how it couldn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’d be fairly easy to find a Weezer fan with qualms about the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Teal Album </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— the featured “Billie Jean” and “Stand By Me” covers leave a lot to be desired. It might not be as memorable of a cover album as Tony Bennett’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duets</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or Mark Kozelek’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Rats</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some might even go as far as to file it under the “so-so karaoke” section of the record store. Maybe none of these are too far from the truth. Regardless, listening to this album is like watching your parents sing along to the songs they grew up with — they’re not perfect renditions, nor are they refreshingly innovative takes, but they’re not meant to be either. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Teal Album</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is lighthearted in spirit. It’s self-aware. But most importantly, it’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fun</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Only a band that has a song about eating their candy with pork and beans would cover Black Sabbath and TLC in the same album, remain close to the originals and create a final product that still very much fits in with the Weezer ethos.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

artists to change their styles to make more money. Today, there are new means and opportunities awaiting artists’ effortless abilities to expand their musical talents. For some, it’s not about moving forward or making money with their music, but rather reflecting a sense of nostalgia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluto — no longer considered a planet — is also the pseudonym of one of the most influential artists in the hip-hop/rap industry today. If you’ve ever heard a young man in a song mumble, “I am Pluto,” then you have just heard the voice of Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, a.k.a. Future, a rapper and songwriter from Atlanta, Georgia. His style envelopes a version of hip hop that he created himself, truly isolating himself from the mainstream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his many names, the man of the hour has just released his newest album on Jan. 18. Time after time, Future has brought back the heavy trap beats that he first started with, inducing an intense sense of jubilation. This new hip hop creation known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WIZRD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> captures Future’s most hidden and magical identity as his work induces an ultimate sense of nostalgia. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His alter identity, Pluto, transcends the listener, forcing you to separate yourself from your thoughts and surroundings, making the music your sole focus.

In all these cuts Future illustrates his life stories to show you how unstoppable he is and how unstoppable you can and will be if you just take a listen.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unicorn Purp” is one of the few songs on the album with a feature that includes Young Thug and Gunna. Not any artist gets to end up on an album with Future. His selection of features is very narrow, but that’s because not every voice fits into the aura of head-banging music that Future creates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you feel the crowd in your head as you blast his voice through your speakers, feeling your head bob like a maniac? That is the power of Future: to make you feel the insane need to be that crazy go-getter of a person that you’ve always wanted to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there’s “Temptation” and “Baptize,” but why bring these up as a separate entity from the rest? Because this Wizrd tries to play a trick on us all; he has no magical wand, just the realm of his musical imagination. The smallest yet most intricate patterns are woven into a melody of sounds not everyone may notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both “Temptation” and “Baptize” enclose warped soundtracks of two of Future’s classics. In “Temptation” the ending is actually the intro to one of his older songs, “Honest.” He is explicitly showing us that he wants us to recall the memories that he is trying to hold on to, the ultimate nostalgia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With “Baptize” comes a break in the lyrics where he uses the beat from another old hit, “Slave Master.” Future’s references in these two tracks gives a sense that his artistry is rooted in meaning, not just another hit to top the charts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time artists change, but Future has proven with yet another album that no one can change him or his music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven’t already, it’s time to immerse yourself into a track of songs that will not only bring you back to who Future really is, but will bring you back to remember what’s most important in your life. So go find your medium, whether that be music or writing, art or god knows what, and use your nostalgia as inspiration. Tell your story. The outcome might be pretty darn good, trust me. And if you don’t believe me, “go ask Tanya.” I’m just bein’ honest.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

jazz-fusion group Snarky Puppy performed in Santa Barbara for the first time after 12,000+ performances in six continents since their formation in 2004. Before the show, band leader and bassist Michael League gave a master class to UCSB’s Jazz Combo and students from San Marcos High School. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures announced the concert, I was thrown back to a memory of when I saw them at the 2016 Reno Jazz Festival. Their set was loud and flashy, splashed with bright purple lights and smoke. At the time, my knowledge of Snarky Puppy was limited to the benevolent ramblings of my high school jazz teacher who would exclaim his love for the group. In 2019, I finally  experienced this excitement for seeing them live that my teacher had three years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside the Granada Theater, the stage was illuminated with a gorgeous mix of purple, blue and magenta lighting. An array of curious instruments patiently sat on the stage; bongos, congas, an organ, a flute, two keyboards and more foreshadowed the craziness that would soon take place. Among the chitchat of anticipation, a mix of classic soul, funk and R&amp;B floated faintly in the background. The crowd was a blend of young and old jazz enthusiasts, all with glistens of bubbling eagerness in their eyes as “I Got You” by James Brown accompanied their chatter. Once the lights dimmed, I immediately sensed the aura of enthusiasm for what was to come. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snarky Puppy, comprised of 10 musicians, opened their set with a breathtaking percussion solo by Nate Werth. Slightly elevated above his band members under a single spotlight, Werth soloed as all eyes, including his bandmates’, focused on him. After a roar of applause, the group burst into their opening song, “Semente.” The wispy melody of flute juxtaposed the blaring horns and synths, creating a rock- and funk-filled atmosphere that captured the audience and welcomed them into the band’s eccentric world of music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They next played “Bigly Strictness” and “Chonks,” two songs from their upcoming album. Full of heavy synth bass, distortion and reverb, “Chonks” was instantly a crowd favorite. On the keys, Shaun Martin soloed over the booming bass with high-pitched riffs straight from outer space. He occasionally spoke the lyrics, “Chonks,” on beat into the microphone which invoked giggles every time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following song, “Thing of Gold,” the band took a more interactive approach. Martin secured lead as they neared the head of the song and questioned if the audience knew the iconic melody. The crowd responded quickly by shouting the nostalgic tune, their voices filling in the gap and becoming a part of the show. Martin ended the performance with an astonishing organ solo and entertained the audience by humorously incorporating “Amazing Grace” into his improvisation. One audience member yelled, “Preach!” as the rest erupted into laughter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning to their next song, League prefaced with a disclaimer for the track: “It’s kind of hard,” he said. Before counting off the band, League said, under his breath, “Okay, ready? Nope, me neither.” The incredible tune “Xavi” then took off with no caution, like a roller coaster let loose of its tracks. The flute made a return, only to be startled by the demanding and assertive presence of electric guitar. As the song progressed, the atmosphere became like a beehive, an organized chaos. The horns were unstoppable bustling bees on a mission, contradicting the rhythm section, a steady and intuitively accented buzz. The tension from the crowd anticipating a resolution to the chaos shifted to a massive roar of cheerful applause as the band members finished the journey and high-fived each other in a sigh of relief. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other highlights from the show included an astounding drum solo in their new song “Bad Kids To The Back” by Jason “JT” Thomas, who received a couple standing ovations. Watching Thomas skillfully play his instrument was like watching a blur: dozens of movements within seconds that could not be comprehended by an amateur but made perfect sense to its player. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snarky Puppy ended their set with the popular “Shofukan,” and an encore of “What About Me?” It was heartwarming to see the audience of all ages unify through the uncontrollable urge to groove along with the music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easygoing presence of Snarky Puppy — in their casual jeans and t-shirts talking and laughing with each other on stage and with the audience — contrasted the jazz and fostered an unforgettably intimate and otherworldly show. They captured the beauty of jazz: a confident, spontaneous, instinctive and passionate form of art that combines the musicianships of the group and individual self-expression, all while making it their own and having fun. For the audience to respond to the finale on their feet — clapping, raving, yelling, waving, throwing up “rock on” signs with their fists — was a sign of gratitude to Snarky Puppy for transporting them into their purple, blue, and magenta world for two hours on a Sunday night. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86811\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86811\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/","id":6597,"author":{"id":684,"name":"Kelly He"},"related":[6596,6595,6594],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
