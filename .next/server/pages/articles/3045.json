Local student DJs were judged by a checklist system based on mixing ability, song selection, originality, energy and audience response. The four DJs with the highest scores — Beta wave, PsychoJohn, T-Fresh and Dropwise — will move on to the next round at tonight’s final competition at the Hub.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Program Board publicity coordinator Karen Masumoto, third-year communication and film &amp; media studies major, Battle of the DJs is a new incarnation of the annual Program Board event Battle of the Bands, which also aims to spotlight local student talent.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to do something new,” Masumoto said. “We always have transitions during Extravaganza when there’s no music playing, so we thought that during that time we could really use DJs. And we kind of wanted to spotlight all the DJs in Isla Vista since there’s so many house parties that have talented DJs.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Speak Volumes editor-in-chief Dylan Chase — who is one member of DJ duo PsychoJohn — said the event allowed electronic music artists across “a whole gradient” to display their different brands of talent, utilizing different techniques ranging from controllers to vinyl to CDs to live mixing.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to show that DJing is a craft and that there are varying levels,” Chase said. “We try to incorporate different stuff into our routine. We do live performance and play vinyl records.”</p>\n<p>Describing their music as a “dreamy and ephemeral kind of house vibe” that ranges from “soul and funk music,” Chase and his DJ partner — third-year film &amp; media studies major Alex Ho — have already played shows at I.V. Theatre, Indochine and SoHo in addition to last night’s performance at the Hub. According to Chase, he and Ho “like to play that funky shit.”</p>\n<p>Tyler Fish, a fourth-year communication major who goes by the DJ name T-Fresh, described his music as “bouncy and highly energetic” and he said the roots of his DJ career go back to his freshman year during Deltopia, which he described as “pretty fucking legendary.”</p>\n<p>“I was a drummer all my life and I was in numerous bands … then I realized that bands aren’t playing backyards on DP — it’s DJs,” Fish said. “So I picked up my first pair of turn tables, sold my drum set and got some speakers.”</p>\n<p>Chemistry graduate student Matthew Snedaker, a.k.a. DJanet Napolitano, said his influences are rooted in hip hop and that his DJ name is derived from his views on the UC President.</p>\n<p>“I really like Janet Napolitano as a person. I think it’s really important to have a woman in this position,” Snedacker said, “But you have to also consider that she’s a politician and she’s making an absurd amount of money when she should be a public servant, and that bothers me a lot.”</p>\n<p>Third-year film &amp; media studies and sociology double major Ashkan Karimloo — whose DJ name is Kuro—said Battle of the DJs has allowed upcoming talent in the newly emerging electronic music scene to distinguish and legitimize their craft.</p>\n<p>“With DJs, there’s usually this kind of stigma that they just stand there and press play,” Karimloo said. “This is cool because it shows what people can actually do, and it’s good to just to get word out that there’s this different variety of talent and music being played.”</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-54077-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Front-page-DJ-photo_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=2090%2C1362\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54082\",\"title\":\"Front page DJ photo_Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/bottom-right-DJ-Photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=4163%2C2439\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54081\",\"title\":\"bottom right DJ Photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Bottom-left-DJ-photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=700%2C652\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54080\",\"title\":\"Bottom left DJ photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Upper-right-DJ-photo_Angela-Kempf-Luu.jpg?fit=902%2C900\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54079\",\"title\":\"Upper right DJ photo_Angela Kempf-Luu\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/Upper-left-DJ-photo_Kenneth.jpg?fit=700%2C652\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54078\",\"title\":\"Upper left DJ photo_Kenneth\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p>Photos by Kenneth Song &amp;

President Brooke Kopel had <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">appointed</a> four members to the council after <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/a-s-postpones-council-vote-for-second-week/\">concerns</a> about conflicts of interest plagued her choice for the position of chair, current council member Justin Nilsen.</p>\n<p>According to Alonso, the council internally determined that Alonso was the best decision for chair.</p>\n<p>Alonso spoke about his plans for the position of chair at Wednesday’s meeting and in an interview with the Nexus, highlighting his interest in “broadening the accessibility of Judicial Council.”</p>\n<p>He plans to do so in two ways: by reaching out to various boards, commissions and units (BCUs) on campus and by introducing more empathy in judicial council proceedings.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to the judicial process, what often gets left out are the struggles of individuals from various communities, and that allows other people to misinterpret or misunderstand the decisions of other individuals that may have made necessary a judicial council case,” he said in the interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>“I want to do this in order to really give people who might not be as easily understood the ability to be understood.”</p>\n<p>He noted that, while the council is “alright, in terms of a diverse body,” there is always more that can be done to make the judicial process more equitable.</p>\n<p>Alonso said he also wants to work with various BCUs to increase their involvement and understanding of A.S. Legal Code, and wants to encourage them to reach out to the council if they have any concerns about legal code violations.</p>\n<p>“Almost every body of Associated Students violates legal code, accidentally, or on purpose, but usually accidentally. We want to make ourselves known to other people, like hey, if something is happening in your BCU which violates legal code and you don’t like this, we have legal code for a reason, and that’s something that you can come to us about,” he added.</p>\n<p>By gaining a better understanding of A.S. Legal Code, organizations can operate in the most efficient manner, Alonso said, which is his ultimate goal with the Council.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gone to a few BCU meetings myself, the bodies are great, and they have these brilliant missions, but because they aren’t super informed on legal code, they get stuck in a lot of… bureaucratic red tape,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It just really paralyzes action, and I want people to have the best understanding of legal code because it was designed very specifically to allow A.S. to function, not to prevent it from functioning.”</p>\n<p>Speaking to the Senate Wednesday evening, Alonso fielded questions about how he would address conflicts of interest and potential biases that could crop up.</p>\n<p>In response, Alonso affirmed that he was committed to transparency, both amongst council members and from himself. Alonso also noted that last spring, when the council encountered a case where he had a conflict of interest, he immediately recused himself from the discussion.</p>\n<p>Alonso also said the council has been discussing possible bias trainings that they could undergo in order to make the judicial proceedings as fair and understanding as they can be.</p>\n<p>Internally, Alonso plans on revamping the Council’s office space in order for them to be able to hear cases in their office, instead of spending the bulk of their minimal budget on renting out spaces to hear cases.</p>\n<p>He also plans to make the process of submitting a petition more clear by creating a Google form with mandatory questions, noting that petitions that were submitted last spring were bogged down with technicalities and are now being dealt with over six months later.</p>\n<p>Making the office as efficient as it can be is Alonso’s goal for his time as chair, but it’s also important to him to introduce an aspect of warmth to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>“It is important that all people within UCSB are able to feel safe and comfortable and know that the Association has their back.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

He urged the Senate to publicly solicit contributions for logo ideas and then encourage all “A.S. entities to make their opinions known.”</p>\n<p>The logo issue hit close to home for Abboud, as he said all students should be able to be a part of the incredible projects and events of A.S.</p>\n<p>“I believe each and every person in A.S. and even the student body should have had a chance to submit designs and submit their opinion,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<p>Contreras said that while she understands the president’s rationale, she hopes the matter will be resolved quickly, as the Senate has already devoted ample time to the deliberation.</p>\n<p>“President Abboud said that he wasn’t comfortable with the outreach efforts, and I feel that this was a reasonable argument,” Contreras said. “But the Senate had been deliberating on the logo for weeks and very few people voiced concerns, so it didn’t seem like anyone was openly opposed to the change.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53899\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53899\" data-attachment-id=\"53899\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/new-a-s-logo-is-a-no-go-a-s-president-rejects-design/logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53899\" alt=\"Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-53899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.</p></div>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Associated Students of UCSB.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, February 6, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

One significant difference between the two parties lies in how each decides on the yearly slate, with DP choosing its slate through an open primary and OPP through an interview process.</p>\n<p>As for their mission statements, the parties differ only slightly. DP stated on its Facebook event page for its informational sessions that the party’s primary goal is to “challenge the status quo” of A.S. by demanding that the student government become more “Associated with YOU” as an inclusive group for all students, as opposed to remaining “exclusive to a privileged few.” OPP also professed inclusivity, claiming on their own Facebook event page that they value the “honest and absolute representation of each and every student” at UCSB.</p>\n<p>OPP will hold its last informational session tonight from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m at the San Nicolas Classroom. DP will hold two sessions tonight at 8 p.m. in both the Loma Pelona Center and Gibraltar Center in Santa Ynez, with two more sessions to occur Feb. 24 and another two on Feb. 26.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit OPP’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ucsbOPP and DP’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ucsbDPparty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/","id":3044,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3043,3042,3041],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
