Safe Committee, aiming to both recognize April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month and set a new tone for survivorship in I.V., according to Spencer Brandt, president of the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</p>\n<p>“[Sexual violence] is something that our community knows and takes very seriously already, but it was also important to try to debunk some of the myths that are around sexual violence both when it comes to law enforcement, when it comes to who can be made into a victim or survivor of sexual violence,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The video series tackles attitudes toward sexual assault with a three-pronged approach, focusing on the role and support of law enforcement, prosecutors, friends and family during survivors’ times of turmoil. Each video includes members from the aforementioned communities discussing support for survivors in the legal and healing processes.</p>\n<p>I.V. Safe Committee is a collaborative group composed of legal and government offices in I.V. and Santa Barbara. The committee is made up of the I.V. CSD, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office, UCPD, SBSO, Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) and more.</p>\n<p>The committee and Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), a UCSB student group advocating for survivor resources and ending sexual violence, worked on the videos together over the last months.</p>\n<p>The videos were released just in time for April, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>One of Brandt’s hopes was that the videos would do more to encourage survivors to come forward with their experiences. He said this is an important goal in addressing and solving sexual violence in the community.</p>\n<p>“If we do not have more people feel comfortable going through and doing that, then it’s going to continue to be very difficult to solve a lot of these cases, and that really is the bottom line,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Numbers from UCSB’s Title IX Office showed that there had been 320 individual reports of sexual violence in 2018, 140 instances of sexual harassment, 18 instances of sexual discrimination and 133 instances labeled “other.”</p>\n<p>But Brandt noted the numbers of survivors who report incidents of sexual violence is far less than the number of people who actually experience it.</p>\n<p>“The harsh reality is that sexual violence is both incredibly prevalent in the community and peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown that the likelihood of survivors coming forward and reporting their assault to either a law enforcement agency or through other avenues is incredibly low,” Brandt said. “We’re looking at a number of about 10 or 20%.”</p>\n<p>For Emily Montalvo-Telford, director of SASA, it was important that the working process of the videos included input from student voices, especially considering the intended audience of the videos.</p>\n<p>“It’s always best to work with the community that you’re trying to send a message to and hearing [student] voices as a part of the conversation,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The conversation around sexual violence necessitated change, and the video series is a step in a better direction toward helping survivors by leaving behind the phrase “we believe survivors” for something more encompassing, Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“For me personally, believing survivors is a necessary step, but it’s not enough. It’s not sufficient. So the concept of ‘we stand with survivors’ is a commitment to support and a commitment to consistent allyship,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The videos is just one of many actions taken by I.V. community to create a safe environment for survivors and residents in general, Brandt said. This includes the hiring of an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">interpersonal violence investigator</a> in November 2018 and the signing of agreement between I.V. CSD and STESA to create a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\">survivor resource center</a> in I.V. in January.</p>\n<p>“Our community is, I think, really at the forefront of being able to create a culture where it’s both acceptable to talk frankly about these issues and also where we stand with survivors when they come forward and that we will believe them without any reservations whatsoever,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11th print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-87716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The program was announced at the April 23 meeting of the I.V. CSD. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A designated sober party monitor is alerted through telephone if SBSO receives a noise complaint about the party. The monitor then has 20 minutes to shut down the party and lower noise levels, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/sheriffs-office-announces-iv-party-registration-program/\">press release</a> sent out by SBSO on Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is intended to foster a partnership between residents and police, allowing party hosts to remedy noise complaints without the need for a police response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy for Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), announced the launch of the program at the April 23 meeting of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a complaint is received, we then call or text that person and they have 20 minutes to mitigate that noise problem themselves without a police response. So our slogan for that is, ‘Get a text, not a ticket,’” said Schroeder at the I.V. CSD meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we’re hoping people utilize that program, just to kind of foster a more community-oriented policing method out here in Isla Vista, and we hope it’s a popular program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Party Registration Program has been in Schroeder’s plans since his <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\">instatement</a> as Community Resource Deputy back in November 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think the students realize there’s like families and young kids that live in Isla Vista. We have some families that call every single night about a noise complaint,” Schroeder said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program builds on Schroeder’s goals of constructing a community-policing model and bridging the gap between law enforcement and community members. The program allows I.V. residents to monitor themselves, without the need for police intervention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar programs are also in effect in cities around the country. San Luis Obispo’s adoption of this program has been successful at California Polytechnic State University, according to the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must follow a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IV-party-registration-guidlines2.pdf\">set of guidelines</a> in order to register a party with the program. Parties must be registered at least 48 hours in advance and can only be registered for Fridays and Saturdays, as well as Sunday if the following Monday is a holiday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police will be dispatched if contact cannot be made with the party monitor, and a citation will be issued if noise violations are verified. A citation will also be issued if a second complaint is received by SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Properties will also lose registration privileges for nine months if complaints are received for two separate parties within nine months of each other. Individuals who have received a noise violation citation or a social host ordinance violation cannot register for the program for nine months after the last violation occurred. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, people who have received a public nuisance party citation cannot register with the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Juan Camarena of the IVFP also believes that the program will create a clearer line of communication between I.V. residents and law enforcement, along with establishing a safe environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program embraces the idea of community-oriented policing and partners community members with law enforcement to solve the problem of noise complaints in Isla Vista,” Camarena said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It also creates an open line of communication between the community and law enforcement, shows transparency and cooperation, and encourages future partnerships to solve other crimes.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
