Attendees were asked to join different groups in order to discuss current issues facing I.V. in a small setting and then afterward presented their findings to the larger audience. The groups focused on potential services that could be offered by an I.V.-specific CSD, included improved plans for parking and transportation, planning, housing, health and wellness, arts and culture, infrastructure, community advocates, a community center, lighting and public safety.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel Executive Director Rabbi Evan Goodman opened the event and said Hillel has hosted a number of community organizing events related to self-governance from last Spring quarter to present day.</p>\n<p>“We feel it is very important that the community, the members of this community, the students in the community at large take responsibility for our community to make it a better place,” Goodman said, “So, little by little, we are moving the ball down the field.”</p>\n<p>Community organizer Darcel Elliott, who kicked off the forum with a discussion on services related to law enforcement, said policing practices in I.V. need to be “proactive”.</p>\n<p>“Since the population has grown and the number of officers has stayed relatively steady, there has been more reactive policing as opposed to proactive,” Elliott said, “So we were talking about a need for someone who is dedicated just to proactive policing, and we also talked about the expansion of the CSO program, which is the community service officers on campus.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60590\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60590\" data-attachment-id=\"60590\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/town-hall-meeting-discusses-i-v-infrastructure/a-member-of-the-ucpd-discusses-public-safety-issues/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4.jpg?fit=5472%2C3648&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"A member of the UCPD discusses public safety issues.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423122619\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"A member of the UCPD discusses public safety issues.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Self Gov Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60590\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-4-1024x683.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"A member of the UCPD discusses public safety issues.

Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and fourth-year global studies major Jacob Lebell said improved transportation services need to be introduced to I.V.</p>\n<p>“The buses could maybe be linked to a system of bike rentals or something, like the city bikes in New York or something,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebell, the typical I.V. internet connection is slow and expensive, thus he suggested empowering an I.V. CSD to break the current cable monopoly by providing other internet services to Isla Vistans.</p>\n<p>“Trying to either get more competition of internet service providers or maybe even trying to have like a community services district have the ability to create a municipal broadband internet, maybe that could even be a source of raising a little bit of revenue,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>Williams also gave a brief history on <a title=\"I.V.: A History — Part I\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-12-01/i-v-a-history-part-i/\" target=\"_blank\">past attempts to turn I.V. into a CSD</a> and said it is important residents spend money in I.V. in order to continue generating revenue for the local community.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60587\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60587\" data-attachment-id=\"60587\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/town-hall-meeting-discusses-i-v-infrastructure/das-williams-explains-ivs-history-of-self-governance/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-1.jpg?fit=3648%2C5472&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3648,5472\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 70D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Das Williams explains IV's history of self-governance&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1423120598&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;800&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0166666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Das Williams explains IV's history of self-governance&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Self Gov Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60587\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Self-Gov-Town-Hall-1-683x1024.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Das Williams explains I.V.'s history of self-governance.

According to IVFP officials, deputies began notifying I.V. residents and property managers in November to make residents aware of the rule change come Feb. 15. The purpose of the new citations, according to the policy, will be to increase pedestrian visibility on the sidewalks and therefore increase their safety by keeping them out of the street.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the high population density in I.V. causes residents to park illegally on sidewalks to make room for more cars.</p>\n<p>“Rising costs make people want more roommates, which means more cars,” Plastino said. “They’re trying to slam more cars into a driveway that wasn’t designed that way.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties. If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk? – First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, the practice of parking on the sidewalk forces pedestrians out into the street and into the path of oncoming traffic. Citations will also be issued to allow pedestrians with physical limitations safe use of the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Sam Perez said he has not ever seen law enforcement officers try to keep people out of the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen I.V. Foot Patrol, or any law enforcement for that matter, make an effort to keep students out of the street here,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the law wasn’t enforced in the past because I.V. lacked a complete sidewalk network.</p>\n<p>“You go over to Goleta and you’re not going to see a whole bunch of people just standing in the middle of the road, because they have sidewalks there,” Plastino said. “So the thought was: If you’re a pedestrian and you’re walking down DP, you need to be on the sidewalk; you can’t be in the roadway.”</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph said the enforcement does not make sense because parties tend to keep people off sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties,” Joseph said, “If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear. – IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plastino said California law states that cars cannot park in a way that blocks sidewalks and that now that DP has a sidewalk running its full length, IVFP can enforce the law correctly.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that people start realizing that the sidewalks are there now, and sidewalks can be utilized for pedestrian use,” Plastino said. “If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major Adam Chukhman said it would be hard to keep everyone off the street even with the new restrictions because people simply don’t want to walk on the sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“The reason people walk on the street isn’t the lack of good sidewalks,” Chukhman said, “it’s the lack of want to walk on the sidewalk.”</p>\n<p>First-year chemical engineering major, John Stair said the he does not think citations would keep people from walking in the street.</p>\n<p>“It’s clear that they want people to stay off the street and stay on the sidewalk, but that’s just never going to happen,” Stair said.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, I.V. will need more funding to be able to complete sidewalk installation along El Nido, Trigo, Seville and Madrid roads, as well as the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I.V. residents showed support by honking car horns, cheering on protesters and by joining the protest.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major and event attendee Kevin Villar said he relates to the evicted families because of his personal experience with a similar situation that occurred in his hometown.</p>\n<p>“This situation has a huge impact on me because my family and I got evicted during my childhood at apartments that we used to live at,” Villar said. “It makes me angry to see the reality that most landlords in I.V. only care about profit.”</p>\n<p>Villar also said the evictions may have been particularly “traumatic” for children of the evicted families who may have thereafter been exposed to inappropriate aspects of I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“Just think of the kids and the traumatic experiences of not having a home. They deal with that fact that there will always be drunken students on the street and see drugs weekly,” Villar said. “Yet they still get evicted, which is injustice.”</p>\n<p>Former I.V. resident Maria Hernandez, who was among those evicted from the Abrego Villas, said her family prefers to live in I.V. and that the eviction has been particularly difficult because she is a single mother who provides for other family members.</p>\n<p>“It affected us so much. I live in Goleta but I would rather live in Isla Vista much more because my family prefers to be here,” Hernandez said. “I believe it is an injustice, especially because I am a single mother who supports my children and grandchildren.”</p>\n<p>Another evicted tenant from the Abrego Villas, Valentina Hernandez, said she believes it was racist of the landlord to evict her and her family.</p>\n<p>“It is discrimination because they initially said they were not going to kick us out,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I believe it is a racist act because they still do not have anyone living there, not even new students who can afford it. They said that they would reconstruct the building and slowly let us back into homes.”</p>\n<p>Valentina Hernandez said she has been living in different hotels and homes since she was evicted and said she feels like she has not been told the entire truth regarding her eviction situation by her landlord or the property management company.</p>\n<p>“I have been living in several motels since then. My daughter’s a school teacher and has also felt bad for us and housed us as well. I feel like a refugee,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I think this type of thing happens every now and then but I feel lied to and discriminated against.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60381\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60381\" data-attachment-id=\"60381\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/protesters-march-through-isla-vista-in-objection-of-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422629444\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"26\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60381\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C266\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60381\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Freebirds employee and I.V. resident for the past 13 years Briselda Martinez said she still does not have a permanent home and now lives in a place without a bathroom.</p>\n<p>“They did so much damage to us,” Martinez said. “I do not have a stable home still. They only gave us 60 days in the summer to find a new house. Now, I pay $750 for a really cramped up room with no bathroom whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>Martinez also said being homeless is not an option because she has family in Mexico that relies on her for financial support.</p>\n<p>“I am going to withstand everything because I cannot live in the streets,” Martinez said. “I definitely cannot go back to Mexico because there are no jobs there. I send money to my sons in Mexico and it is difficult.”</p>\n<p>Three-year resident of I.V. Jacinto Rodriguez said he joined the protest because he believes the evictions were an act of discrimination for the sake of profit.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it is racist and very wrong,” Rodriguez said, “We have nowhere else to live and it is not the same.”</p>\n<p>Rodriguez also said the evicted tenants do not deserve to be booted from their homes when they have insurance and good credit records.</p>\n<p>“This is an effort between everyone because they do not want to see my people evicted from Isla Vista. It is essential to have a roof over your head,” Rodriguez said. “In my case, they have checked my record, insurance and credit which is good and important, but they still evicted me.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60383\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60383\" data-attachment-id=\"60383\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/protesters-march-through-isla-vista-in-objection-of-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422630968\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60383\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C266\" alt=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-11\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alumnus and former I.V. resident Sharlene Macharia said it is vital that demonstrations bring attention to the eviction situation so that students and I.V. residents can collectively take action so those IVTU alleges were wronged can see justice, as well as to prevent similar instances from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am glad that people are protesting and marching.

Clinic building to discuss public issues in I.V. with long-term residents, students and staff.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s forum featured a continuation of a discussion from <a title=\"Stakeholders Meeting Discusses I.V. Demographic Difficulties, Parking\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/\" target=\"_blank\">last week’s meeting</a> concerning parking problems and deliberation on ways to popularize arts and culture in I.V. The stakeholders meeting is one of several held weekly for the past few months concerning pending legislation in the California state assembly to turn I.V. into a community services district (CSD). A larger-scale town hall meeting will also be held at 7 p.m. on Feb. 5 at Santa Barbara Hillel to discuss potential services that would be offered by the proposed I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. homeowner Steve Fisher said there are 3,100 legal parking spaces in I.V., a significantly small amount compared to the number of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“There are 3,100 parking spaces [and] 21,000 residents,” Fisher said, “That’s one parking space per seven residents.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk, investigations concerning parking in I.V. may be conducted through collaboration with the university geography department.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I was thinking about getting in contact with the geography department, and seeing whether that was something they would even want to change,” Schunk said. “Because for all I know, they’ll say maybe, ‘We don’t care enough,’ or ‘we have other things focus on.’ It’s contingent upon whether the geography department is willing.”</p>\n<p>Art professor and long-term I.V. resident Kim Yasuda said increasing available parking space would decrease available public gathering space for arts and culture events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what’s replaced [public space] is parking,” Yasuda said. “Parking has actually taken up all of our formal public spaces that you would have in Europe, and Mexico, such as public plazas.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda also said I.V. First Fridays at People’s Park is an example of how the availability of more space can provide a safe environment for showcasing art and gathering community members in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I.V. First Fridays is the gathering of some 400 people late night that’s safe and public and engaging,” Yasuda said. “So I’m making the case for public space access both during the day and after hours to be part of this whole arts and culture concept of Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>James Joyce, deputy district director for State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, said among other services provided in I.V. such as water, lighting and policing, discussion concerning arts and culture related services is seldom prioritized in self-governance.</p>\n<p>“When you’re looking at the arts and culture I can understand that there may be a resistance when you see it among the other options and services,” Joyce said.</p>\n<p>According to Joyce, arts and culture is an important community aspect that should not be neglected in the self-governance discussion.</p>\n<p>”When in history have artists not come in to save the day?” Joyce said. “Whenever there is a rebirth or a renaissance or something along those lines, the artists are always the first ones in. The starving artists. Why? Because they’re cheap, and because it helps rebuild things … that’s kind of my mindset.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60486\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60486\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/","id":4785,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4784,4783,4782],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
