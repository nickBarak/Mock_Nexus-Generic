Northridge improves to 13-13 overall and 9-3 in conference.</p>\n<p>From the tip, Mitchell went with a small lineup, which was successful Thursday against Long Beach State. Instead, UCSB paid the price on the boards, losing the rebounding battle 55-28. CSUN also destroyed Santa Barbara in second chance points at 26-9.</p>\n<p>“They kicked our butts is what they did,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “(Junior center) Camille Mahlknecht on her own had (almost) as many rebounds as we had as a team. Our lack of block outs led to 26 second chance points and that’s the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Leading Northridge was Mahlknecht. While she averages just 7.7 points and 7.7 rebounds on the year, she was the thorn in the Gauchos’ side, recording a season-high 21 points, a program record and career-high 22 rebounds and five blocks on a career-high 10 made field goals.</p>\n<p>“We took all switches one through five, but I don’t think that was the issue. When we look at it, I think a lot of it will be high-low hits against our biggest post players,” Mitchell said. “That’s a mentality. She’s a good player, but she plays with a lot of heart and she understands her role. A lot of plays aren’t being run through her with the three great guards they have, so she’s finding a way to dictate the outcome of the game by getting rebounds and putbacks.”</p>\n<p>The Matadors started the game right where they left off when they beat Cal Poly 83-57 Thursday. Against the Mustangs, Northridge went 11-22 from three point range. With Santa Barbara down 4-7 in the first half, Northridge went on a 10-0 run, starting the game 3-5 from downtown and shooting 66.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>After Northridge’s lead reached its largest of the half at 19 points, Santa Barbara came alive. Fueled by the three Gaucho seniors, the team went on a 12-2 run to cut the lead to nine. Several times in the second half, UCSB came within nine, but could never get the needed play to break the barrier.</p>\n<p>With just less than eight minutes remaining at the lead at that same nine point lead, the Matadors closed the door they had been leaving open for UCSB, going on a 19-6 run to finish the game.</p>\n<p>“I remember we missed a couple easy shots,” Mitchell said. “That’s going to happen in the game of basketball, but at the end of the day, you need to sprint back and say, ‘okay, well now let’s get a stop.’ That’s the only way if things aren’t flowing smoothly on the offensive end is that you have to buckle down and get stops. We didn’t.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Zornig led the team offensively with her first double-double of her career, tallying 21 points and a career high 11 rebounds. She shot 8-18 from the field, including 4-6 from behind the arc. Nesbit also added 14 points for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Mel is so consistent. I don’t know if she knows she’s near 1,000 points or not, but at the end of the day, she’s getting after it,” Mitchell said. “She’s doing it on both ends of the floor, but she’s carrying too much of the burden. We have to have other players willing to join her.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their three-game road trip next week when they travel to UC Riverside Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear int he print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54048\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54048\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-16/ucsb-falls-in-northridge-for-first-time-since-1984/","id":536,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[535,534,533],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Go For Fourth Straight Victory at Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Mens_.Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt-1.30.2014.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Mens_.Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt-1.30.2014.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has already defeated Long Beach State this season and will attempt to sweep the season series Thursday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Exactly at the halfway point of conference play, the UCSB men’s basketball team has often looked like the best team in the Big West.

Despite committing 19 turnovers (compared to the 49ers’ seven), the Gauchos managed to hold Long Beach to under 30 percent shooting on the night and an even worse 19 percent in three-pointers.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure it’s going to be a lot tougher to play there because I would bet money that they shoot a whole lot better [tonight] than they did at our place,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They’ve won five of their last six in league and they’ve been a very formidable team.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s leading scorer and assist man in junior point guard Mike Caffey led the team with 21 points last time against UCSB, but was the only player to score in double figures. Junior guard Tyler Lamb, who averages over 15 points per game, was held to five points on a dreadful 1-13 shooting in the loss.</p>\n<p>“That’s what our goal is, to execute our defense the way we need to and make them take the shots we want them to take,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “I doubt they’re going to shoot as poorly as they did at our house.”</p>\n<p>Bryson led the Gauchos with 13 points against Long Beach in January and has lifted UCSB in recent games, scoring 18 in last week’s victory over Hawaii. The athletic wing player ranks third on the team with just under 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>“He’s regained his shooting form and he’s playing very physical and rebounding and playing tough,” Coach Williams said. “He’s a key ingredient for us. He’s one of those versatile pieces that allows us to play several different sizes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game off three straight victories, the fourth such time this season. The Gauchos have yet to win four straight, however, and will look to do so against a Long Beach team that will have the crowd on its side.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really tough environment, it’s a great home crowd. They’ll have it sold out, it’ll be rocking,” Coach Williams said. “They’ve made basketball a real priority there and you can tell by their home attendance that it’s something that they’ve put a lot into as a whole school.”</p>\n<p>Leading the charge in the hostile environment will be Big Al who ranks eighth in the country in points per game and fourth in rebounds. Williams leads the Big West in points and rebounds, is second in blocks and ranks seventh in field goal percentage and steals.</p>\n<p>“Al has had a superior year, he’s been absolutely spectacular. He brings it night in and night out and I think he’s getting better,” Coach Williams said. “His conditioning looks better, his confidence in shooting the ball from the perimeter is getting better — he’s improving in every way.”</p>\n<p>While things are certainly looking good for the Gauchos as a program, the team received devastating news that sophomore guard John Green will miss the rest of the season with a fractured wrist. Green previously missed the past two seasons with foot injuries, and after finally playing in his first regular season game as a Gaucho this season, will miss a third consecutive year to injury.</p>\n<p>“It sucks. It’s a really sad and unfortunate and unlucky kind of situation. John is the strongest guy that I know and I know he’ll get through it,” Big Al said. “We’ll consistently pray for him and maintain our faith. He’s going through a lot right now but his spirits are up and this team is picking him up. I just can’t wait until he finally gets back out there on the court.”</p>\n<p>Now with even more motivation to play for their fallen teammate, the Gauchos will certainly be ready for the task against a Long Beach program that has consistently battled UCSB atop the Big West standings in recent years.</p>\n<p>“We think it’s going to be a pretty hostile place. It always is,” Big Al said. “It’s always a big game between us two and their fans really show up and make a lot of noise. They’re going to be out there hungry for a win so it should be a good environment.”</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Long Beach State at the Walter Pyramid tonight for a 7 p.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 13, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54014\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54014\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/","id":533,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[532,531,530],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Returns to Form Against Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos blow out the 49ers 80-69","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team entered yesterday’s game against Long Beach with a 1-7 Big West record.

On the very first possession, Zornig dove on the floor, earning the jump ball call. She drained a three on the other end to give Santa Barbara a 3-0 lead and from there, UCSB never looked back.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos jumped out to an 11-0 lead, allowing Long Beach just two shots and forcing six turnovers in the first three minutes. The 49ers remained scoreless until the 16:37 mark.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch told us before the game that we’re 0-0 going into this game and not to worry about our record,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We brought energy this game. In the first half, we set the tone and kept it up most of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB stretched its lead to 21 points less than 60 seconds into the second half, its largest lead of the game, and coasted to the easy victory. With the win, UCSB improves to 7-15 overall and 2-7 in conference. Long Beach drops to 13-11 overall and 5-5 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Like the Gaucho squad from earlier this season, Santa Barbara used its defense to fuel its offense. UCSB hassled Long Beach defensively, forcing 18 of the 49ers 22 turnovers in the pivotal first half.  They even gave Long Beach a taste of their own medicine, winning the steals battle 9-2 against the Big West’s best team in picking their opponent’s pocket.</p>\n<p>The turnovers allowed the Gauchos to turn to their best offense, pushing in transition. UCSB scored 22 points off Long Beach’s turnovers and outscored the 49ers 32-10 in the paint. They also outscored the 49ers in second chance points 17-6.</p>\n<p>“[The transition game] was huge,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We love to run. I mean, who doesn’t? When we get out and run, we know it’s going to be our best offense and it’s just fun.”</p>\n<p>For the first time during Mitchell’s rein, five players finished in double-figures for Santa Barbara. Zornig led the team with 18 points and seven rebounds, but it was a true team effort as all five starters had solid evenings.</p>\n<p>“I’m smiling, especially with the assist to turnovers and the fact that we attacked and got to the free throw line,” Mitchell said. “We just have to continue to grow and get better. We’ll test ourselves on Saturday and see if we can go two games back to back.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope to ride their momentum Saturday when they travel to Cal State Northridge. Tip-off is set for 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54041\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54041\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-returns-to-form-against-long-beach/","id":534,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[533,532,531],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The NBA Hits a Home Run and Bans Donald Sterling","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Donald Sterling received a lifetime ban from the NBA for his racist comments caught on audio.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Donald Sterling saga has developed into one of the most stunning and baffling stories in the world of sports in the last several years.</p>\n<p>Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was caught on audio recording telling his girlfriend, Vanessa Stiviano, that he did not want her posting photos of black people on Instagram or bringing black people to Clipper games.

Essentially, Sterling is stripped of all power but remains owner, is responsible for signing checks and fronting money and is still able to make money off the Clippers.</p>\n<p>The next move for the NBA is to remove the title of ownership from Sterling, a move that is possible only if three-quarters or more of NBA owners approve the vote. There is no doubt that owners will approve this, as any vote to keep Sterling as an owner of the NBA will be a black eye for the NBA and the owner of whichever franchise votes to keep him.</p>\n<p>Silver and the league office hit a grand slam with the decision to ban Sterling for life given the circumstances of Sterling’s comments and his previous racist actions. Social media exploded following Tuesday morning’s announcement as journalists, owners and players, current and former alike, all praised Silver’s decision to hand out the maximum punishment allowed to Sterling.</p>\n<p>Sterling deserves all backlash and punishment that comes his way following these remarks. However, his previous actions also call into question why he was allowed to continue as owner of the Clippers.</p>\n<p>Previously, Sterling was accused of discriminating against families with children, and Black and Latino tenants in apartment buildings he owns. A settlement was agreed upon and Sterling never admitted to guilt, but there have been several instances where his racial viewpoints have been called into question.</p>\n<p>It was not until the NBA’s hand was pushed by the audio recording that the league chose to take action against Sterling. It is a shame that he was allowed to stay for so long in a league so renowned for its progressiveness in social matters such as this.</p>\n<p>One reason that Silver’s decision is so justified is it takes pressure off Clippers fans, players and personnel to abandon ship during an important playoff run. Many were calling for those associated with the organization to boycott, calling into question their morals for non-action.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think it is unfair for people to blame players for wanting to continue to play and asking them to forfeit an entire season of hard work in response to an owner’s actions. The players play for each other and the fans, not for the sake of the owner’s happiness. Likewise, fans no longer have to battle whether to continue supporting the team and attend games or boycott and leave the players with empty stands during this critical playoff series.</p>\n<p>This is certainly an important day for the NBA and especially for the Clippers organization. There is no room for this type of behavior or these thoughts in sports and the NBA made the right decision to get rid of Donald Sterling.
