To combat the ongoing surge of cases, Byington said the university must “flatten the curve” of coronavirus transmissions through tactics such as social isolation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The modelers for this COVID-19 infection predict, on the low end, 30% of the world’s population becoming infected and 70% on the high end over the course of a year,” Byington said. “That is billions of people and will result in millions of infections in the United States.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hospital facilities that we have in the state of California, that we have across the UC, that we have in the United States, will be overwhelmed if these models are not slowed down through social mitigation,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Universities across the country, including </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have transitioned to remote instruction to mitigate the spread of coronavirus through social distancing. All UCs are also canceling various in-person events on their campuses, according to Rachael Nava, the UC’s executive vice president.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to coronavirus’ rapid rate of infection, the UC will need to respond quickly to issues regarding the disease as they arise, according to Nava.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This situation is very fluid, it’s changing practically from minute to minute,” she said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of individuals who contract coronavirus will recover, possibly without showing any symptoms, but about 20% of those with the virus will require hospitalization and up to 5% may require intensive care, according to Byington.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monica Martinez, a 19-year clinical care partner at the UC Los Angeles Medical Center, voiced concern to the Regents about the decreasing number of available beds in the hospital.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our unit is always full and we always have a shortage of beds,” she said. “We must extend our capacity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents also heard from Laurence Young, a UCSB librarian who said he is concerned about the “sluggish” reaction to coronavirus and the University Library’s in-person operations potentially enabling the spread of coronavirus. Later in the day, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2020-03-18-covid-19-update-test-results-and-library-services\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the library would be closed beginning Thursday, with no cited date to reopen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB is the largest employer in Santa Barbara and many of us, especially in the library, live paycheck to paycheck,” Young said. He requested that the university “ensure that anyone who cannot work during this crisis receives full administrative leave with pay.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding paid administrative leave for library staff, but UC President Janet Napolitano issued an </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/uc-president-extends-employees-paid-leave-with-executive-order/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">executive order</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Monday granting 128 hours of paid administrative leave for all UC employees.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the teleconference, Student Regent Hayley Weddle voiced student concerns and stressed that resource centers for students — regarding basic needs such as food, housing or legal help — should remain open for students to access.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students should be central and viewed as partners in decision making surrounding the university’s response to COVID-19,” she said.</span></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unconscious person; one count each of sexual penetration by a foreign object, sodomy of an intoxicated person and oral copulation with a person prevented from resisting due to intoxication; and two counts of criminal threats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, 47, will originally expected to be sentenced on Jan. 29, 2020, but that date was pushed to March 18 after his lawyer had a scheduling conflict in another county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 16, in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus, Presiding Judge Michael J. Carrozzo signed an administrative order to continue most cases in the Santa Barbara Superior Court to after April 3, 2020, delaying Galoustian’s sentencing again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This story will be updated once another date has been set for the sentencing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karapetian said it is expected that he will be sentenced to 18 years in state prison and will have to register as a sex offender for life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mr. Galoustian has taken full responsibility for his conduct,” Leonard B. Levine, Galoustian’s lawyer, said on Wednesday afternoon. He added that Galoustian would accept the court’s sentence “pursuant to the plea agreement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district attorney’s office had initially charged him with 33 felony counts, which were filed on behalf </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/galoustian-will-face-charges-on-behalf-of-two-victims-during-january-trial/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two victims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Nexus previously reported. He had initially pled not guilty to all the charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karapetian said that she selected the eight charges for the plea agreement based on the evidence behind each charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The eight charges] reflected his criminal conduct in different ways. Each count he plead guilty to reflected a separate crime he committed on each victim,” </span>Karapetian said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said in an email that the last two counts of criminal threats are “serious felony strike convictions,” meaning that if he commits any “qualifying” felony offenses after his release from prison, “he will be looking at a minimum mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UC Santa Barbara class of 2005 alumnus, Galoustian was well-known in the community as a long-time Isla Vista resident and as the owner of iVMenus, a food delivery service. He had operated the business from 2008 up until his arrest; it has since shut down, and the location where it used to operate, 910 Embarcadero Del Norte, has not been occupied since.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was initially arrested on Dec. 18, 2017, for charges relating to the rape of one victim; during the discovery process, prosecutors became aware of a second victim and filed charges on their behalf as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long duration of the court case has been criticized by Judge James E.
