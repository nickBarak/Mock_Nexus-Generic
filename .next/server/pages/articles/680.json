As a result, the Gauchos drop to 11-13 overall and 7-5 in the Big West, falling into fourth place in the conference standings. Cal Poly, on the other hand, improves to 14-9 overall and 8-4 in league.</p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m going to be creative in trying to get these guys to play free, play the basketball we’re capable of and play the way we play on the road,” Mitchell said. “Maybe I can get the administration to okay us to stay in a hotel around the corner, so that way we feel like we’re on the road.”</p>\n<p>In this Blue-Green Rivalry game, great offense beat solid defense. Santa Barbara, which prides itself at keeping its opponents much below their scoring average, was unable to stop the Mustangs’ potent offense as their 65 points are just shy of their 68.4 point-per-game average.</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently 1-8 when its opponent breaks the 60-point mark. Overall, the Gauchos were outshot by the Mustangs 45.3 percent to 35.1 percent.</p>\n<p>“A stat that always lets me know that we’re going to be in trouble is when we take more field goals than the opponent, especially a team like Poly,” Mitchell said. “That’s their game to get up and down, so we can’t expect to play their style and come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>For the second-straight game, UCSB couldn’t contain 6’5’’ Molly Schlemer. The junior center led all players with 18 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>From the first tip, Cal Poly took control. Tied at two, a three by sophomore guard Ariana Elegado sparked a 16-0 run for the Mustangs. Aided by nine first-half turnovers from UCSB, the lead grew to its largest margin of 17 with just under 10 minutes remaining in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB narrowed the lead to eight with 16 minutes to go, but three consecutive treys by Cal Poly were enough to keep the Gauchos at bay. The 9-0 run was spurred by Elegado and senior guard Kayla Griffin, both of whom finished in double figures with 12 and 15 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>On the game, Cal Poly was 8-17 on threes for an incredible 47.1 percent.</p>\n<p>“We just guarded the No. 1 three-point shooting team in our conference in Pacific, so there really should be no excuse,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos responded, going on a 14-4 run to narrow the lead to seven with 6:07 remaining. The momentum was in UCSB’s favor, but a three by Elegado brought the lead back to 10 and would be too much for Santa Barbara to overcome.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Sweets Underwood paced UCSB offensively, tallying her 10th double-double of the season with 15 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its three-game homestand Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 19th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-19/gauchos-fall-to-rival-cal-poly-at-home/","id":680,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[679,678,677],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Running This Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As the youngest team in the Big West, the UCSB men’s basketball team has shown it can compete with the top teams in the conference.

Earlier in the season, UCSB defeated Cal Poly in an 83-81 double-overtime thriller. Emotions can certainly be expected to be running high when these two teams face off again on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We got some good practices this week, and even though we have a lot of injuries, I feel like a lot of guys are going to be healthy and ready to go by this weekend,” junior guard Kyle Boswell said. “Coming off a big win against Pacific, I feel like we’ve got some momentum rolling and a lot of us are starting to understand what it’s going to take to get some more wins and go on a winning streak in the next few games.”</p>\n<p>Last time out against the Mustangs, Boswell hit what would become a game-winning three-point play with 12 seconds left and scored the Gauchos final six points. Boswell is currently second on the team, averaging 13 points per game, and has switched roles much of the season between a starter and the sixth man.</p>\n<p>“We know playing them the first time that Cal Poly is a scrappy team and they’re talented,” Boswell said. “We’re going to have to bring a high energy level and execute at a high level in order to beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB may be without its star player in sophomore center Alan Williams who sprained his right ankle in the first half of the Pacific game. Williams has missed three games this season due to an injury to his hamstring, an injury that first occurred in that double-overtime victory against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“He’s moving around a lot better than he did when he got hurt last weekend,” Boswell said. “I can tell things are getting better, so it’d be great if he’s available for this Saturday, but if not, we’ll be ready regardless and we’ll have a chance to win whatever his status is.”</p>\n<p>With the possibility UCSB will be without its star player, the Gauchos might have to rely on freshman forward Sam Beeler to fill in for Big Al. Beeler has come on strong as of late, playing a career-high 23 minutes against Pacific in which he scored six points and grabbed four boards. Another player UCSB will rely on is junior forward Shawn Moore, a walk-on in his first season as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“That’s going to be huge because we’re going to need depth,” Boswell said. “We’ll be ready to go. Cal Poly is a good team and if we don’t all come together and basically contribute individually in order to make our team better, we’re not going to get this win this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off two straight victories over Pacific and UC Davis, and will end a three-game homestand Saturday. Overall, UCSB has won 11 of the last 12 meetings against Cal Poly and owns the all-time series record 69-31.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs are led by junior forward Chris Eversley, who is first on the team in scoring with 15.4 points per game and the only player to average double figures for Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in forward Taran Brown and guard Michael Bryson will also be pivotal in Saturday’s matchup, as each has shown flashes of brilliance this season for the Gauchos. Brown is third on the team averaging 12.1 points and Bryson is fourth at 6.9 points per game. In his last three games, however, Bryson is averaging 12.7 points and six rebounds per contest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody needs to step up,” Coach Williams said. “Injuries are not an excuse, it’s just what happens and it creates opportunities for other guys.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green rivalry game is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at Cal Poly’s Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/","id":677,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[676,675,674],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Men’s Basketball: Cal State Northridge Matadors","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last year, a young Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team surprised everyone, finishing second in the Big West.

The Matadors have taken on No. 21 Oklahoma, No. 8 Penn State and No. 14 UCLA.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s always about getting better,” Flowers said. “We felt like with the team we had, we had to challenge them early.”</p>\n<p>The UCLA game proved the potential of this young squad as the team beat the Bruins 77-72 on Dec. 20 at Pauley Pavilion. At the time, UCLA was ranked No. 12 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“[Our players] believed they could win and we got it done at both ends of the floor,” Flowers said. “It was great for our kids to get that experience and getting the win.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Matadors are four underclassmen. Two of the team’s sophomore guards, Janae Sharpe and Ashlee Guay, were predicted to make the all-conference team.</p>\n<p>Guay leads the team with 13.8 points per game, good enough for fifth in the Big West. She also ranks third in the Big West in assists and second in steals with 3.9 and 3.0, respectively.</p>\n<p>“Ashley’s been good for us,” Flowers said. “She’s a tough kid and she’s running the offense. She’s [also] the first line of the defense.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore center Camille Mahlknecht anchors the team inside, leading the conference in blocked shots with 2.4 per game and ranking fourth in rebounding, pulling down 8.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Finally, freshman forward Marta Masoni fills a weakness from last year’s team: threepoint shooting. The Taranto, Italy native averages 13.0 points and shoots 43.2 percent from behind the arc, which is second in the Big West. As a team, the Matadors lead the conference in three-point field goal percentage at 35.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Despite having plenty of offensive firepower, Northridge has proved solid on the defensive end as well. The team ranks second in the Big West in scoring defense, allowing just 59.2 points per game, and leads the league in field goal percentage defense at 33.8 percent.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Matadors will be a home game against UC Irvine Saturday.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/cal-state-northridge-matadors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/cal-state-northridge-matadors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/cal-state-northridge-matadors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/cal-state-northridge-matadors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/cal-state-northridge-matadors/","id":678,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[677,676,675],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lakers at a Crossroads Without Owner Jerry Buss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Los Angeles Lakers have lost a legend.

Along with the Yankees’ former owner George Steinbrenner, Buss always did what it took to make his team the best. He never shied away from the biggest personalities or from opening up the checkbook to sign players and coaches like Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, James Worthy, Pat Riley, Phil Jackson, Shaquille O’Neil, Steve Nash, Dwight Howard and, of course, Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>But now all of that is in the past. His death, along with the fact that the Lakers’ supposed “super team” is a meager 25-29 and the Clippers are turning into a powerhouse, confirm that the Lakers franchise is at a major turning point. Without the wise and omniscient leadership of Dr. Buss, where does one of the most beloved and recognizable franchises in the world go from here?</p>\n<p>First of all, if the Lakers miraculously make the playoffs, the consensus is that they don’t have the tools or chemistry to consistently beat any one of the top teams in the Western Conference. They simply do not put together a consistent winning formula night in and night out.</p>\n<p>Howard’s health and attitude seem to be in a constant state of uncertainty. Nash and Coach D’Antoni are torn between running a quick-paced offense and running a slower half-court offense. Kobe is still playing well, but is beginning to hint at retirement.</p>\n<p>Above all else, this Lakers team no longer expects to win. When the Lakers are at their best, they expect to win every single game. Now the first question is how badly did they lose tonight?</p>\n<p>Looking beyond this year, Bryant has one year left on his contract worth $30.4 million, Howard becomes a free agent after this season, Gasol has one year left on his contract worth $19.2 million, Metta World Peace has a player option for next year worth $7.7 million and Nash has two years remaining worth a combined $20 million.</p>\n<p>All of that means that after next season, Nash will be the only current player under contract assuming Howard, Gasol and Bryant all leave. So, what do the Lakers need to do? What they always do, use the salary cap space to spend the money and use the L.A. lifestyle to bring championship players to their team.</p>\n<p>One thing that would go a long way in helping the Lakers achieve that would be to retain the services of current General Manager Mitch Kupchak, who was Dr. Buss’ right-hand man.
