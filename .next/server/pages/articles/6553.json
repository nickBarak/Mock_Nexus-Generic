At the time of passing, Malcolm was well into the process of recording his companion album to ‘Swimming,’ entitled ‘Circles.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sept. 7, 2018, Malcolm James McCormick, known by his stage name Mac Miller, died of an accidental drug overdose. The hip hop community found itself in utter devastation, with many artists dedicating their performances to him and fans mourning over the loss of someone who gave lyrics and sounds to their own personal feelings. But, to the pleasure of all the people he inspired, Mac Miller had been recording his project “Circles”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with producer Jon Brion, who continued to work on the album after his death. With this album, fans were given one more ending note, a solacing goodbye to their beloved hero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months before his passing, Mac Miller dropped the album “Swimming”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that helped us understand the mindset of the famed rapper, who seemed mentally stronger and had a better understanding of his hardships than ever before. Then came “Circles</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” the beautifully unique sequel, giving Mac a final conclusion to his oscillating thoughts.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We simply know that it was important to Malcolm for the world to hear it,” his family continued. Both albums, “Swimming”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “Circles</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voice Miller’s problems dealing with his depression and anxiety. But “Circles” doesn’t build on the previous album; it instead takes on a more experimental sound and never truly evolves into a typical rap album. The folksy beats with his soft singing show a distinct side of Miller putting his personal and musical evolution on full display.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album begins with the song “Circles,” in which Mac sings, “And I cannot be changed / I cannot be changed” — commemorating his struggles and evoking a sense of sadness over his unexpected death. However, he keeps an optimistic tone and beat throughout the album, and by the time you get to “Good News,” you see how he manages to maintain a light tone despite the harsh circumstances. Comparing the lyric “spring cleaning” with clearing his mind, Mac Miller sings his pain: “There’s a whole lot more for me waitin’ on the other side.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We miss him. We are left to imagine where Malcolm was going and to appreciate where he was,” Miller’s family explained. There’s something so beautiful about the melodies throughout this album. The various instruments, the symphonic sounds, the lo-fi beats; it all translates the exact feelings that his lyrics describe. Songs like “Blue World” and “Hands” give an alternate, deep-house sound, combining multiple genres. Throughout the album, you hear a different sound and tone within each song: together a creative, unabridged project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the album, Miller seems to reach different conclusions about his emotional pain. He seemingly creates mental notes, maybe even reaching a better mindset for himself while being slightly buoyant and possibly optimistic. Yet, you still hear the darkness and sorrow of his words in each verse of every single song. Miller shows us his ability to create an amalgamation of both misery and hope, and you finally see the translucent light at the end of the pitch-black tunnel that he’s beginning to see.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to relate to Mac Miller’s thoughts. We all feel the instability of emotions he describes and understand his constant jump between confusion and certainty, knowing that he’s “busy trippin’ bout some shit that still ain’t even happen yet,” but still fighting his dark thoughts. The love he has for this other person he talks about and the dreams he hopes to achieve with them — it all seems so comfortably relatable as we listen and daydream about the person we can’t stop thinking about. By the end of the album, the certainty in his voice is stronger, more visible than the start, “And I know that somebody knows me. I know somewhere there’s home.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This album leaves you smiling through the tears, intensely happy and devastated at the same time; Mac Miller is alive through his songs and all the people that he resonates with. Whether you’re a fan who began listening to him after his death or one of those who knew him from the beginning, he rests with so many of us all the same. When you listen to this album you feel this energy, and he sounds alive. His pain, his love, the instruments, the lyrics — they are all so real. A perfect resolution in Mac Miller terms. The ups and downs, side to side, the circle.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92190\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/mac-miller-gets-personal-in-posthumous-album-circles/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92190\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/mac-miller-gets-personal-in-posthumous-album-circles/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/mac-miller-gets-personal-in-posthumous-album-circles/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/mac-miller-gets-personal-in-posthumous-album-circles/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/mac-miller-gets-personal-in-posthumous-album-circles/","id":6553,"author":{"id":661,"name":"Neha Makkapati"},"related":[6552,6551,6550],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":661,"name":"Neha Makkapati","biography":"Not available","articles":[6269,6553,6561,6574,6575,6589,6613,6618,6656,6870,6874,6947],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Dance in the Age of COVID-19","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Performing Art","publish_date":"2020-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/UCSB-Dance-Department-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/UCSB-Dance-Department-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For UC Santa Barbara’s dance majors, virtual classes are uncharted territory and have left many of them struggling to find their footing.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to online learning this quarter has not been without complications for any of us, but this is true even more so for majors that are built upon in-person instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For UC Santa Barbara’s dance majors, virtual classes are uncharted territory and have left many of them struggling to find their footing.

The dance department does not rely on GauchoSpace the way other departments do, so instructors are figuring out how to use the platform at the same time as their students. “They don’t know what we can see and what they can see, so that’s been rough,” Lousen admits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the unforeseeable global pandemic, all Spring Quarter 2020 productions have had to be canceled or rescheduled, which is disappointing for dancers who have devoted hours of their time each week to rehearsing and perfecting their performances. Even though these shows will not take place as planned, Stewart does not view the past year’s work as wasted time because of relationships she formed with her fellow dancers. “The community, the collaboration, it’s been so inspiring to work with them whether or not we got to perform it.” She also mentions that there is a chance that these performances will see the stage in the future, but everything is still up in the air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year dance major Colson Lynn says that he is making the best of the situation by taking advantage of the abundance of resources found online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so much out in the dance world right now that’s being offered for free. I’m taking classes with a bunch of different choreographers that I never would have had the experience otherwise because they’re all based in New York. Their classes are online and free, so I’ve been motivated to keep practicing by taking something new,” Lynn said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between academic classes, rehearsals and performances, dance majors are used to having highly structured schedules, and for third-year dance major Amity Beardsley, the lack of structure to her day has been the most difficult aspect of online classes. “I personally need structure but I prefer when it’s laid out already. It’s been hard to get everything done on my own terms. Honestly, I don’t think I have as much work, but because I have a hard time getting motivated it takes me probably double the amount of time.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In comparison to many other majors, where classes are generally rather sedentary, the life of a dance major is defined by physical movement. With the stay-at-home restrictions, the hours spent in front of her laptop are less than ideal, says Lousen. Given the extra time, she makes it a point to explore other classes and activities in order to recalibrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of the obstacles that dance majors have had to navigate, many of them take comfort in knowing that they are a part of a close-knit community where everyone looks out for one another. Second-year dance and psychological &amp; brain sciences major Isabel Meena noted that several dancers formed a group chat called “Movers and Zoomers” once they realized that classes were going to be online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially during this when we’re all kind of struggling at home, it’s been really nice to at least know we can get in class with each other. The first Zoom meeting that we had, where I got to see all my friends’ faces on a computer screen, that’s better than nothing,” says Meena. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s administration has still not decided on how it will approach Fall Quarter 2020 instruction, but Stewart says that the dance department is pushing to get its students back on campus as soon as possible. “Our faculty is incredibly creative, obviously, and they have all these very creative solutions and ways that they could go about keeping us safe but still allowing us to dance.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If classes do not return to in-person instruction for the upcoming school year, however, many students are re-evaluating the decision to pay full tuition for remote instruction and are considering taking fall quarter off. Meena admits that she is not sure if virtual instruction is worth the challenges. “It makes me wonder, if classes end up being online in the fall, if I want to keep doing that to myself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the face of COVID-19, students and faculty have been inspired to come up with creative solutions for what will ultimately just be a bump in the road for the department. In the meantime, these dancers will continue to lean on their passion for their craft as they look forward to hitting the dance floor with each other once again. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

months leading up to its release, “The Slow Rush”  has finally arrived. Five years have passed since Kevin Parker’s last album released under the Tame Impala banner – a gap that has certainly been felt by alternative and psychedelic rock fans alike, generating a build-up of hype unprecedented in the indie music scene. Unfortunately, the new record does not nearly meet its high expectations, offering a mostly redundant listening experience with only a couple of stand-out tracks with strong thematic elements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Slow Rush” opens strong, with an eerily augmented vocal riff on the track “One More Year.” The song sets the mood of the album flawlessly, and I quickly empathized with Parker’s warning — that time is imminent and uncontrollable. The narrative of the opening track weaves a tragically familiar scenario of procrastinating a major life change and instead staying in your comfort zone. This is Tame Impala tackling more grounded storytelling than ever before, and it makes for an infectiously groovy, yet quite bleak, dance song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following track, “Instant Destiny,” unfortunately feels significantly less creative in terms of production and theme. Parker’s repetitive chorus is not at all helped by an orchestra of indiscernible and bland synths. The lyrics are by far the loudest element, and yet they are sparse and lazy. “Instant Destiny” is representative of the greatest downfall of “The Slow Rush”; it is one of many forgettable and underdeveloped tracks that bring down the overall piece.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Borderline” follows, which is thankfully one of the better tracks featured on the record. It was one of the initial singles released in 2019 and suggested a promising tone for “The Slow Rush” months in advance. “Borderline” is a highlight in the existing tracklist for its echoey dive of an opening alone. However, I much preferred the single “Patience,” released in 2019 as well, which did not make it on the final record. “Patience” featured more unique and inspired instrumentation, creating an extremely satisfying dance track that also leaned heavier into the psychedelic genre. I can’t help but wonder what “Patience” would have contributed to the vibe and flow of the new record.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92998\" style=\"width: 1450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"746839136\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92995\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92998\" data-attachment-id=\"92998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-21/in-review-the-slow-rush-by-tame-impala/the-fader/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?fit=1440%2C962&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,962\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Fader\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92998\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Fader.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Parker of Tame Impala. Courtesy of The Fader</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Posthumous Forgiveness”  does not greatly inhibit the flow of the record; however, it is one of a series of longer tracks that muddles the middle of the album’s runtime. It offers an enticing and slightly spooky guitar riff, reminiscent of Elton John’s “Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,” which is unfortunately overtaken by synths for what should be the guitar solo. The lyrics are the song’s strongest attribute, implying a calamitous betrayal that can be easily felt when Parker wails, “Did you think I’d never know?”  The setup is interrupted halfway through the song, however, for an unexpected and ultimately unmotivated shift into aimless pop, derailing another storytelling high point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breathe Deeper” stands out as a clear low point in the tracklist. What creativity is present feels merely recycled from earlier tracks; “Breathe Deeper” is essentially just a slightly worse version of “Instant Destiny.” Furthermore, it falls right in the middle of the record, slowing the flow of the album to a halt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the backend of the record drones into repetitiveness and mediocrity. “Tomorrow’s Dust”  and “Lost in Yesterday” are decent, though middling, tracks that could use more inventive production to be distinguishable. “Is It True,” “Glimmer” and “One More Hour” are forgettable and could be omitted entirely. “Glimmer” feels like a well-intentioned attempt at an instrumental, although Parker does virtually nothing special with the instrumentation. “One More Hour” is an unfortunate closer to the record as well, feeling empty of insight or innovation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On Track” and “It Might Be Time” are surprisingly compelling additions in terms of mixing and narrative. They preach a much more mature and evolved understanding of the force of time that Parker puts so much emphasis on. They contribute to a more satisfying conclusion, with booming percussion and narrative revelations. However, their arc is interrupted by the other mediocre tracks, and the unifying of themes and sonic motifs fizzles out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the years of anticipation and excitement, “The Slow Rush” is still a very unexpected release, — unexpected in the sense that Parker has updated his sound without innovating it. The evolution between Tame Impala’s last two albums, “Lonerism”  and “Currents,” was a pure refining and deepening of Parker’s already unique take on psych-rock. Sadly, Parker seems to have left his psychedelic roots behind completely and has instead embraced party noise and generic pop. Although I enjoy a handful of these new tracks, I think “Patience” is a far better listening experience than the finest offerings of “The Slow Rush.” Even if it takes another five years, I can only hope that Parker’s next project is a return to his original, unique form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall Album Rating: 6/10</span></p><div
