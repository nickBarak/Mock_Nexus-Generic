The organization itself was founded in 1971 by community members after riotous protests that resulted in the burning of the Bank of America in I.V.</p>\n<p>Goodman said that she wants to expand on Miller’s legacy. She described Miller as an “authentic, caring and competent leader” who grew the IVYP “from a small child care center to the diverse and impactful organization it is today.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s optimism reflects her passion for the program. She said that her main goal currently is to learn everything about the IVYP, from her duties to the people, programs and partners that surround the agency.</p>\n<p>She explained that one of the major challenges she expects to face during her first few months is funding, as with many nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p>“Most of IVYP’s budget comes through the California State Department of Education,” she said. “I have a lot to learn about how that funding works, but my experience with governmental funding is that it rarely pays enough to provide the salary and benefits that teachers deserve.”</p>\n<p>She also described IVYP’s relationship to UCSB as “unique” especially as an increase in UCSB admission rates will affect housing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As UCSB moves forward in its plan to enroll more students, that will likely impact housing and services in Isla Vista. Anticipating those changes and ensuring that children and families are not forgotten will be part of my agenda,” she said.</p>\n<p>In the future, she wants to focus on spreading awareness about IVYP and its comprehensive role both in and out of the community.</p>\n<p>“More people should know what we’re doing. We serve children and families in I.V. and Goleta, but our leadership can and should be recognized far and wide,” she said.</p>\n<p>As Miller prepares to conclude her long career at IVYP, she remains grateful for the ability to have genuinely enjoyed every day of work over a span of 33 years. She began at IVYP as a teacher and assumed the role of executive director a year later.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been blessed with the perfect intersection of education, skill set, passion and faith: the ability to do meaningful work to make a difference in our community,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>The next stages in Miller’s life include plans for traveling, cooking, focusing on her health and enjoying time with her husband.</p>\n<p>“I hope I will be remembered as someone who led with heart and head,” she said. “Someone who believed that all the children and families deserve equal access to education, safety, health and respect… someone who truly enjoyed the energy, vibrancy and goodness in Isla Vista that is often missed up those outside the community.”</p>\n<p>Miller hopes that Goodman will fall in love with IVYP.</p>\n<p>“At IVYP, we are working to address the root causes of so many societal problems. When we have strong, whole children and families, our community thrives. What could be more important than that?” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>Goodman is also no stranger to community service. She previously worked at Child Abuse Listening &amp; Mediation (C.A.L.M.), where she served as chief development officer and as a member of the senior management team.</p>\n<p>She has also previously worked as a camp counselor, program director, day care monitor, teacherand youth group advisor.</p>\n<p>Goodman has a deep connection with the I.V. community through her tight-knit family. Her son attends UCSB and her husband, Rabbi Evan Goodman, serves the campus through Santa Barbara Hillel. With the new gig, Goodman joked, she can now meet with her spouse for lunch at Freebirds.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/","id":4337,"author":{"id":207,"name":"Jasmine Moreno"},"related":[4336,4335,4334],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":207,"name":"Jasmine Moreno","biography":"Not available","articles":[2339,2345,2761,4337],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Many experienced lung problems from the smoke and ash in the air. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was horrific,” said Darren Schmitt, a 46-year-old homeless local. Schmitt regularly sleeps on a cushion behind Embarcadero Hall, tucked in a corner out of sight of the students passing by.</p>\n<p>When the air quality in I.V. plummeted in the wake of the Thomas Fire, most students fled the neighborhood for their permanent residences. Schmitt stayed on the streets.</p>\n<p>“I watched ash drop all night here,” he said. “Everyone else was wearing [the masks], but I didn’t, so I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, a group of good Samaritans handed him a mask. But Schmitt, uninformed of just how bad the air had gotten, didn’t feel like wearing the mask all day. Believing his mask to not be fully effective, he discarded it.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, volunteer chaplain at the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said events like these are far more than unfortunate for the “house-less” of I.V. — they’re life-threatening.</p>\n<p>“You take someone who’s got respiratory problems to begin with — many of them are smokers — and it’s desperation,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>Some of those seeking shelter experienced asthma attacks, coughing and hacking as they finally arrived to an environment with cleaner air.</p>\n<p>Others suffer from lung-related ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or emphysema. Hedges himself felt pain in his lungs, he said, though he had a home to return to.</p>\n<p>Homeless locals are allowed entry to a Warming Center at the University United Methodist Church on Camino Del Sur. Those straying in can receive dinner and blankets.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing this for 10 years, serving our community and making sure our friends without a home have a place to go to when it’s cold and wet outside,” said Ed Wesson, operational manager for the Freedom Warming Centers of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Warming Center opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 6:00 a.m. the next day. At that time, Schmitt said, those who stayed overnight are told to leave, regardless of the weather outside.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain,” Schmitt said. “We’re sent out onto the street.”</p>\n<p>In the case of last week’s rainfall, Schmitt escaped to an underground garage in Goleta and hid until the storm cleared.</p>\n<p>“When rain like that comes, we get wet, and all our stuff gets wet,” added another local, who would identify himself only as Jeffrey.</p>\n<p>For decades of living in I.V., Jeffrey has made money by fishing at Goleta Beach and collecting recyclables. Days of heavy rain get in the way of his ability to fish, leaving him with little recourse for money.</p>\n<p>Not all the homeless despaired under the conditions. Another local, who gave his name only as Danny, scoffed at the idea that he was under distress.</p>\n<p>“We live our lives outdoors and fight through everything,” Danny said. “Rain and fire don’t scare me.”</p>\n<p>Each spring, the Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H) releases an annual census on nationwide homelessness. The 2017 account, published in March, found a population of 26 homeless I.V. locals, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\">reported</a>. Multiple homeless people said they were suspicious of the figure, agreeing that it felt too low. Hedges refuted the number altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe what happened with that,” Hedges said. “I know the numbers, and the count was just wrong.”</p>\n<p>If census-takers wanted to get an accurate homelessness count, Hedges said, they could attend free dinners served by local churches. When the 2010 census was taken, he rallied homeless people to sign up. If people were to stand up and be counted, Hedges said, it would make for a telling political statement.</p>\n<p>“If you stand up for a census,” he said, “it says, ‘Here I am — you’ve got to count me, I exist. Now deal with me.’”</p>\n<p>If the “powerful” were to know the extent of the problem, he said, there could one day be a difference.</p>\n<p>With the weather cleared, the homeless are free to go about their days on the I.V. streets. Some roam on their bicycles, others hang out at a stone bench on Pardall Road that they’ve dubbed “the bedrock.” Schmitt and Jeffrey sit on the ground at Anisq’Oyo Park and share a jar of peaches. When he reflects on the past month’s trying conditions, Jeffrey is animated but maintains that it doesn’t faze him.</p>\n<p>“We do have a home,” he said, lying horizontally on the ground and tucking his backpack beneath his head. “All of us out here depend on each other.”</p>\n<p>He travels light, but does carry a cardboard sign he likes to show I.V. residents walking by. It boldly reads, “Refuse to have a bad day.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/","id":4334,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4333,4332,4331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Confident Heading into Nashville for NCAA Regionals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016.05.26_StephenManga_Baseball-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016.05.26_StephenManga_Baseball-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are the No. 2 seed headed into the Nashville Regional and will face Washington of Friday at 12 pm in the first game of the Double Elimination tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After achieving another 30-plus win season and finishing third in the Big West Conference, the UCSB baseball team clinched the No. 2 seed in the Nashville Regional, making this the second consecutive year and the third time in four seasons that it has received an NCAA bid.

The 2014 NCAA champions finished the season 43-17, 18-12 in conference to host its fourth straight regional.</p>\n<p>Another possible opponent is No. 4 seeded Xavier who finished the season 30-28, but boasted a strong 14-4 conference record that helped to get them into the tournament.</p>\n<p>Although their record shows an average mark, the Musketeers have won 16 of their last 18, making them the hottest team of this bunch as well as maybe of the entire 64-team roster of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>One of the more interesting things to be seen is how UCSB can fare away from home, especially with traveling all the way to Vanderbilt which is located in Tennessee. Although UCSB only posted a 10-12-1 road record, they picked up the slack a little bit winning three of their final four road games to end the season.</p>\n<p>“So far, it has energized the guys,” Checketts said. “They are so excited to be here and really, for a lot of them, this is their first experience to this. Hopefully that energy stays with us for this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first round match-up against Washington will be the first meeting of the two teams since 2009 in which UCSB won 8-2 as well as the 15th overall matchup between the two programs’ history, with Santa Barbara holding a slight advantage at 8-6.</p>\n<p>All-Big West First Team pitchers junior Shane Bieber and redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson will look to stay hot on the mound and keep the scores low to help their team move on to the next round.</p>\n<p>Bieber went 11-3 on the season — the most wins in the Big West — pitched four complete games, had the fifth most strikeouts (91) and the 10th lowest ERA (2.96). Nelson, the star reliever, went 7-2 with eight saves, fifth most in the conference, had the fourth best ERA in the Big West (2.27) and tied for the most strikeouts (73) by a non-starting pitcher in conference.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, UCSB will rely on All-Big West Second Teamers sophomore first baseman Austin Bush and sophomore second baseman J.J. Muno. Bush led the team in home runs (7) and RBI (43) while Muno led the team in hits (57) while ranking second in slugging percentage (.450), home runs (5) and runs (40).</p>\n<p>Other noteworthy players include the four honorable mention players such as sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher who led the team in at-bats (205), redshirt junior Andrew Calica who led the team in on-base percentage (.446), redshirt junior Devon Gradford who led the team in slugging percentage (.469) and senior third baseman Ryan Clark who ranks fifth on the team in batting average (.270).</p>\n<p>On the opposite side, Washington definitely has quality players that it plans on utilizing to get the win. Key players include junior Chris Baker who leads the team in batting average (.325), hits (66), home runs (7), RBI (34) and slugging percentage (.512). Baker is assisted by sophomore infielder Levi Jordan who is second on the team in batting average (.316).</p>\n<p>Similar to the Gauchos, the Huskies also have a solid reliever helping their pitching staff, led by senior right-hander Troy Rallings who currently owns the second best ERA in the entire country with a 0.89 and has earned 16 saves on the season.</p>\n<p>“Washington is a good, solid team and they have a good pitching staff,” Checketts said. “They are solid all around.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB wins Friday’s match-up, then it would face the winner of Vanderbilt/Xavier on Saturday. If they were to lose, then they would face the loser of Vanderbilt/Xavier. In double elimination, once you lose two games, you are out.</p>\n<p>Vanderbilt has two very solid hitters that currently bat over .330 in junior Bryan Reynolds and sophomore Jeren Kendall. Both players started all 60 games and currently have over 50 RBI and both received All-SEC Second Team recognition for their strong season at the plate.</p>\n<p>Xavier’s strengths lie in its ability to hit the ball hard. The Musketeers were first in their conference in slugging percentage (.512) and had the 34th most home runs in the country with 54 long balls. Both senior infielder Andre Jernigan and junior outfielder Joe Gellenbeck have 13 home runs apiece to lead the team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos definitely have a tough road ahead of them this weekend, but this is nothing new for the young baseball team. All year, this team has defied expectations and gone above and beyond, and there is no doubt they will be ready for this Regional.</p>\n<p>Under the current playoff format, Santa Barbara has never made it into the Super Regionals. With its 11th appearance in program history in the Regionals maybe this can be the year it advances to the next round.</p>\n<p>“I think if we come out and play how we want, we are going to win,” Checketts said. “This is a good team and we are ready.”</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against Washington in the first round of the Nashville Regional at Hawkins Field on Friday, June 3 at 12 p.m. PDT.

If it can have another solid week then it might be able to crack the NCAA Top 25 for the first time this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the other side of the mound, the Roadrunners have struggled mightily up to this point in the season coming into this game with a 5-14 overall record, as well as losers of 12 of their last 13 games including four consecutive losses.</p>\n<p>These two teams are no strangers as last season they split two games with each squad winning their home game. The all-time series record between these two teams is also split at 7-7.</p>\n<p>While this game may look like an easy one on paper, it is important that UCSB does not overlook its opponents. Although it has struggled, CSUB still has the necessary pieces to make games interesting.</p>\n<p>Leading the offensive charge is redshirt junior outfielder Dustin Frailey who leads the team in batting average (.454), in on-base percentage (.545), and slugging percentage (.667). He is also one of two players to hit a home run this season.</p>\n<p>Helping Frailey lead the charge is David Metzgar. The junior currently leads the team in RBI with 17 while also batting a solid .329, good for third on the team.</p>\n<p>Pitching wise, the Gauchos will most likely face junior Max Carter. The right hander has struggled this season having an 0-2 record while posting an 11.05 ERA. Carter has allowed nine runs in 7.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Carter, if he wants to turn around his season he will have to do it against one of the hottest teams in college baseball right now.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are led by first baseman Austin Bush who is second on the team in batting average (.370), first in hits (20), and first in RBI (19).</p>\n<p>The sophomore has had a great season thus far winning Tournament MVP honors in San Diego, named Big West POTW, and most recently hit a walk-off home run to give his team a victory. While Bush’s performance has been great he has also received tremendous help from a slew of players.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomores JJ Muno and Josh Adams lead the team in home runs (3), while redshirt junior Andrew Calica leads the team in on-base percentage (.517). Catcher Grover Dempsey, another redshirt sophomore, leads the team in batting average (.422) and slugging percentage (.600).</p>\n<p>Pitching for the Gauchos on Tuesday will most likely be right-hander Shane Bieber. The junior has pitched 33 innings this season, most on the team, posting a solid 3.55 ERA and striking out 27 batters leading to his solid 3-1 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber is hot coming into this game as in the last two games he has allowed only one run in 13 innings while also striking out 13 batters.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara is the clear favorite to win this game, however, it would be smart to not fall into a trap game. Although it has had an amazing start to the season, a loss to an inferior opponent could hurt all the positive attention it has garnered thus far.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also need to be sure to not be intimidated by an away crowd as this season they are 1-2 away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against CSU Bakersfield today at 6 p.m. at Hardt Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
