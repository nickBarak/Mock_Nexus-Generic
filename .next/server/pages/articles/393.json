A total of four Gauchos scored in double figures as the team shot 47.2 percent from the field, 33.3 percent from beyond the arc but had a season-high 26 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“You find a way to win because you get stops,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “When it’s a one-possession game, everything matters. Sometimes as coaches you draw plays and sometimes you have to go make a play, and she [Jemerigbe] made a play.”</p>\n<p>The come-from-behind win improves UCSB’s overall record to 1-2 while the Roadrunners remain winless at 0-2.</p>\n<p>From the game’s beginning, it was Jones with the hot hand, scoring eight of her 13 points on 4-4 shooting in the first quarter. She finished with her first double-double of the season, adding 16 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield showed its willingness to shoot the three-point ball early, making 3-6 shots from long distance. A late make from beyond the arc by redshirt junior forward Erika Williams with 19 seconds left captured CSUB’s 15-14 lead to close the quarter.</p>\n<p>Williams was the Roadrunners’ second-leading scorer with 13 points and shot 4-7 from long distance on the night. Overall, CSUB shot 43.8 percent from deep, making 7-16 attempts.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes occurred in the second quarter as both teams traded points. However, Bakersfield’s defense managed to limit Jones to just two shot attempts in the quarter, restraining her to one attempt from the field in the entirety of the second half.</p>\n<p>Ending the back-and-forth scoring was a three-pointer by CSUB freshman guard Addi Walters. The perimeter shot was the spark to the Roadrunners’ 11-3 run, resulting in their largest lead of the game at 35-29 to enter halftime.</p>\n<p>Scoring the first points in the second half was a three-point basket by UCSB sophomore guard Makala Roper. Despite a 0-2 shooting performance in the first quarter, she tied Jones for the team lead in points with 13. A reserve off the bench, she finished the game shooting 50 percent from the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>However, Bakersfield’s ability to restrain UCSB’s plan to feed Jones in the paint eventually led to the emergence of senior forward Batabe Zempare.</p>\n<p>Held to two points on 1-5 shooting in the first half, Zempare scored the Roadrunners’ first field goal of the third quarter. The score prompted Cal State Bakersfield’s 8-0 run which resulted in its 11-point lead of 47-36.</p>\n<p>Zempare would go off for 10 points in the fourth quarter and finished with a game-high 16 points. While her late scoring rally helped keep CSUB in the game, the Gauchos’ Jones did not believe she had lost the battle in the paint.</p>\n<p>“It was easy,” Jones said when asked about the matchup with the senior forward. “But the second half, she did start slipping the screens. I just started focusing on getting offensive rebounds and put backs.”</p>\n<p>Guiding UCSB’s comeback was the scoring outburst of freshman guard CoCo Miller. Scoreless in the first half, she erupted for all 10 of her points in the second half. She was responsible for seven points during the Gauchos’ 14-4 run.</p>\n<p>“She [Miller] got two layups, hit a three and stopped trying to pass it to everybody,” Henrickson said. “She’s a confident kid, she can shoot it.”</p>\n<p>Providing some valuable minutes off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris as she recorded a game-high four blocks. Santa Barbara’s defense held Bakersfield to a 38.2 shooting percentage and tallied a season-high 10 steals.</p>\n<p>A pair of made free throws by Zempare helped CSUB take a 56-53 lead but a clutch three-pointer by Jemerigbe was the equalizer to force the 56-56 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended up taking a 59-58 lead after a layup by Roper but were caught inattentively on defense by a backdoor cut and layup by Zempare to hand the Roadrunners a 60-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Due to the new NCAA rule that permits the advancement of the ball to halfcourt after a timeout is called and a score has been made with under a minute remaining, UCSB was able to call a timeout to set up the inbound pass to Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 26 turnovers, UCSB outrebounded CSUB 43-24 and outscored the Roadrunners’ bench 28-15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is right back on the road at Oregon this Sunday, Nov. 22. Tip-off will be at 12:00 p.m. in Matthew Knight Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Durr</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For many young athletes hoping to play at the college level, the senior year of high school is the most important one of all. It’s where the good talents are separated from the great ones, where all those college scouts who haven’t been paying attention to you get their last chance to see what they’ll be missing out on if they don’t act fast enough. For freshman forward Chaya Durr of the UCSB women’s basketball team though, that chance never came.</p>\n<p>After spending much of her sophomore year at Sacramento High being the first name off the bench, Chaya became the team’s leader in her junior year. She consistently dominated opponents with her long and versatile body type and filled the stat-sheet on both sides of the floor, resulting in her being ranked as high as No. 38 in the nation among wing players.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off a tournament in Oregon in which she played what she described as “the best games I’ve ever played in my life,” Durr and her AAU team flew to Tennessee to play in another tournament. Then, at the top of her game and right before her all-important senior season began, disaster struck.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to get to the basket, I was dribbling the ball and I fell,” she said. “I wouldn’t necessarily say anybody hit me, I was just off-balanced, and that’s when I went down. It was really painful.”</p>\n<p>There are a select few injuries that every athlete dreads, and even without contact, Durr was handed one of the worst cards she could’ve drawn: she had torn her ACL and would miss her entire senior season.</p>\n<p>“I was really devastated,” she said. “I almost couldn’t stop crying because it was still really painful for a few days.”</p>\n<p>Although she would have to sit out for the next 11 months, Durr tried to take whatever positives she could from the situation.</p>\n<p>“I was thinking maybe it’s meant to be,” she said. “One of my friends told me that it was a minor setback for a major comeback, so that really motivated me a lot to rehab as much as I could when I could.”</p>\n<p>Luckily for Durr, who went to high school with current Gaucho teammate junior guard Jasmine Ware, UCSB’s presence was there every step of the way.</p>\n<p>“In recruiting Jasmine, we were able to watch Chaya play when she was in ninth and tenth grade,” Gauchos Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We knew that she would be one of those athletes that could be a program changer. We really felt that, so we were able to get her to campus early, get to meet our kids and see what our program was about.”</p>\n<p>Despite being faced with an injury that could have drastically impacted the next few years of her life, Durr’s dynamic play prior to her senior year had already earned her a spot at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately for her, but maybe fortunately for us, she did tear her ACL and we’ve been there since day one,” Mitchell said. “That’s probably how we ended up with her, a top 30 player in the country with athleticism, work ethic and a blue collar mentality. The sky’s just the limit with her.”</p>\n<p>With her final year of high school in the books, it didn’t take long for Durr to make her decision on where she would play in college.</p>\n<p>“I committed to Santa Barbara right after [the injury] happened,” she said. “Santa Barbara was the place I had wanted to be forever. My biggest motivation was to get strong for college, because I am going to that next level and it’s going to be bigger and better competition.”</p>\n<p>After a lengthy rehab process, Durr finally returned to the court prior to her freshman year, making her first appearance in a UCSB uniform against Occidental in an exhibition game. In just 14 minutes, she scored nine points to go along with 10 rebounds and two steals, immediately proving her value to her new team.</p>\n<p>“It was our first game, so of course I was nervous, but I went out and I played really well,” she said. “At that moment I knew coach could trust me; that I could get in and get it done.”</p>\n<p>In a season with more downs than ups for a struggling Gaucho team, Durr’s strong performances have been some of the few bright spots this year. After seeing limited time during the first month of play, she again showed her worth in a home game against Washington State, recording her first double-digit scoring performance with ten points. However, it was on the defensive side where she truly shined, as she recorded five steals, tied for the most of any Gaucho this season.</p>\n<p>“Defense is my thing. It’s all I really care about,” Durr said. “That’s always been my favorite thing since high school. I know that when I play good defense and I’m getting steals that that leads to the offensive side.”</p>\n<p>Another month later against CSU Bakersfield, Durr recorded multiple career-highs with 15 points and eight rebounds, further proving that her ACL was no longer an issue.</p>\n<p>“The knee is way in the past,” she said. “I forget I even tore it at some point.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, against Cal State Northridge just one week later, Chaya suffered a concussion, causing her to miss the next nine games of Big West play. Once again, the injury was extremely untimely.</p>\n<p>“When she went down with her concussion, she was probably in the form that we saw in high school,” Coach Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>In her return game against Cal State Fullerton, despite only playing six minutes, Chaya may have helped provide the spark that would see the Gauchos win just their first game of the year.</p>\n<p>“Right when I got in, I got two back-to-back rebounds, which is what our team was struggling with,” she said. “I was just really excited to be back. I probably couldn’t stop smiling, it was just really tough sitting out even a month because I know what it feels like to sit out and it’s not a good feeling at all.”</p>\n<p>With just four games remaining and the Gauchos still with a chance to make it to the Big West Tournament, they will take every contribution they can get.</p>\n<p>With Durr finally back and healthy once more, both her play and her infectious personality could be just what UCSB needs to extend its postseason.</p>\n<p>“Mentally it’s really hard to come back from injury, but you can never tell because of how happy she is and the fighter she has inside of her,” Ware said. “She’s there when you need her the most. If I threw a bad pass or something, she’s going to try and save it for me. She’s just a real team player and there’s nothing more you can ask for.”</p>\n<p>Success might not necessarily be coming to UCSB this season, but with a versatile team player like Durr set to grace the Thunderdome court over the next few years, the future is bright for the Gauchos. With her big injury now behind her, the stage is set for Durr and her team to show everyone what they can accomplish together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of February 26, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Junior center Je Zhe Newton tallied her first double-double of the season with 12 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>As Hawaii was in route to widening the scoring gap between it and UCSB, a three-pointer by senior guard Dioseline Lopez energized UCSB’s performance on the court in addition to trimming Hawaii’s lead to a five-point deficit.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s last six points of the second quarter was senior guard Jasmine Ware. She ended Saturday with 10 points in 29 minutes while going 3-6 shooting the ball and 4-4 from the free-throw line. Still, Hawaii entered halftime with a 31-24 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in its comeback effort in the second half was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She shot a perfect 3-3 from the field in the third quarter to go along with three assists and six points. Jemerigbe led UCSB in scoring with 13 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the third quarter on a 7-0 run which expanded into an 11-2 run in the beginning of the fourth quarter, resulting in UCSB taking a 45-41 lead. It was a high-scoring fourth quarter as the two teams combined for 44 points.</p>\n<p>Three lead changes and two ties occurred within the fourth quarter. Although both teams exchanged baskets, it was Karaitiana that provided the edge for UCSB. Prior to her game-winning three-pointer, she had seven points in the quarter and made her only three-pointers of the game in the final period to help lead the Rainbow Wahine to their 63-62 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to UC Davis this Thursday, Feb. 11 and will face the Aggies in the Bren Events Center at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68000\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68000\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/","id":391,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[390,389,388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for Final Game of Home Stand, Host Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is set for the finale of its three-game home stand as it will face Hawaii in the Thunderdome in search of its fourth consecutive win.

The reigning Big West Athlete of the Week is coming off back-to-back career performances.</p>\n<p>Scoring a career-high 22 points in last Saturday’s victory over UCR, Porter had another outstanding performance in the Gauchos’ most recent win against LBSU Thursday night as she earned her first career double-double with 17 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ leading scorer since the start of conference play, averaging 14.8 points per game, Porter has been most effective from behind the three-point line. During UCSB’s winning streak, she has made at least three shots from behind the perimeter in three-straight games, and is averaging a three-point percentage of 45 percent.</p>\n<p>She is currently tied with fellow Gaucho sophomore guard Coco Miller for third in the Big West in both three-point makes per game and total threes made at a 2.2 average and 38 apiece, respectively.</p>\n<p>Providing a lift on both offense and defense when coming off the bench continues to be redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>In the team’s previous game she tied her career-high of 14 points. Possessing the ability to penetrate and drive to the basket or kick the ball out to shooters, Toler leads the Big West in assists per 40 minutes with a 7.7 average and is tied for third with a 4.3 average per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the aftermath of five seniors departing continues to affect Hawaii as its young core of seven freshman and five sophomores continues to learn their roles on the court.</p>\n<p>A graduating class that included impact players such as leading scorer Destiny King and its leading three-point shooter for three-straight seasons in Ashleigh Karaitiana, Hawaii has struggled thus far this season.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine rank last in the Big West in scoring, averaging 58.1 points per game and are second to last at eighth in three-point shooting percentage at 28.1.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s subpar averages, leading the Rainbow Wahine in a majority of their games has been the team’s only upperclassmen and backcourt duo senior point guard Briana Harris and junior guard Sarah Toeaina.</p>\n<p>Toeaina serves as Hawaii’s leading scorer at 12.3 points per game, while Harris is the runner up at 10.8 per contest. In the team’s win over Cal Poly Thursday night, the two guards combined for 47 points to bolster the Rainbow Wahine’s season-high field goal finish of 57 percent.</p>\n<p>Pacing Hawaii’s great shooting night was Harris, who matched her career-high of 24 points and Toeaina, who finished with 23 points and a career-high six assists.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii has struggled shooting from beyond the arc, it has been exceptional in defending the long range shot as it leads the Big West in three-point defense with a 26.3 average, ranking just ahead of UCSB at second with a 28.3 average.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos have allowed the least amount of total three-point makes in the conference at 68-of-240 in comparison to Hawaii’s second-place standing of 92-of-350.</p>\n<p>With both teams presenting stout defense along the perimeter, it could be expected that both programs attempt to score most of their points in the paint in hopes of sucking in the defense to create opportunities along the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Hawaii will tip-off today at 4 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75047\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75047\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/","id":392,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[391,390,389],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
