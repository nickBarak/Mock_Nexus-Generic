It also includes several exceptions, such as special events.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the authors of the bill hope to discourage extravagant consumption of expensive food at board, committee and commission meetings, as they feel that money could be better spent fulfilling that group’s purpose.</p>\n<p>Issues surrounding the measure’s passage included accusations of classism, worries that certain groups may not be able to carry out specific functions that revolve around food and arguments that food at meetings is a primary method of attracting new members.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Navkiran Kaur said she feels the bill alienates many low-income students who depend on meals provided by A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Christianson, co-chair of the Community Affairs Board, asserted that free food at meetings was a key factor in her choice to become involved in local affairs and warned that C.A.B. would not be able to carry out some of its key missions, such as providing food for the homeless, with such a restricted budget.</p>\n<p>As of press time, senators had not yet discussed the issue. Visit dailynexus.com tomorrow for a full recap of the meeting.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53800\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53800\" data-attachment-id=\"53800\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/a-s-groups-protest-new-food-budget-bill/as-senate-1-29_johnclow_01-29-2014_09/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AS-Senate-1.29_JohnClow_01.29.2014_09.jpg?fit=981%2C558&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"981,558\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1391028458\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"130\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate 1.29_JohnClow_01.29.2014_09\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AS-Senate-1.29_JohnClow_01.29.2014_09.jpg?fit=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AS-Senate-1.29_JohnClow_01.29.2014_09.jpg?fit=888%2C505&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-53800\" alt=\"A.S.

percent of the student body, or 1,783 people, must vote for the special election to be valid, Renteria said at the A.S. Senate meeting on Wednesday. This requirement has been lowered several times to compensate for low voting turnouts in the previous Fall Quarter External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) special election.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 612 students have voted. With only a week until voting closes, the election is still over 1,000 votes away from meeting the eight percent requirement.</p>\n<p>Initially, two students declared candidacy in the special election: Rachel Ng, a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major, and Richard Zierer, a fourth-year political science and English double major. However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Jan. 23, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>If the election meets the eight percent threshold, Ng will only serve for approximately three months until the winner of the Spring Quarter 2019 election is sworn in.</p>\n<p>Ng hopes to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ng-is-sole-candidate-remaining-in-evpsa-special-election/#search\">center her agenda</a> around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>To meet the voter threshold, Ng plans to utilize social media and class announcements. She believes that the lack of voter turnout in the previous EVPSA elections was due to voter burnout.</p>\n<p>This is A.S.’s third attempt to elect an EVPSA since Spring Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>A fall quarter special election occurred due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification of Mayela Morales</a>, a fifth-year global studies and Chicano and Chicana studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the EVPSA position in April, but she was later found to not be enrolled in any classes at UCSB during the Spring Quarter, resulting in her subsequent disqualification.</p>\n<p>Madeline Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, was the sole declared candidate in the Fall Quarter special election. During that special election, however, the 16 percent voter threshold was not met and as a result, Loudon was not voted in.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board spent $50 on the Winter Quarter special election, Renteria said at the A.S. Senate meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Voting for the winter special election opened on Thursday, Jan. 24. Voting closes on Thursday, Feb. 7, and results will be announced that evening.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at simren@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

It would have funded the construction of a roundabout at the northwest corner of the Student Affairs Administration Services Building next to the tunnel between the Recreation Center and Campbell Hall. The proposed roundabout would replace what the Bike Committee calls the “triangle of death.”</p>\n<p>According to Emily Littleworth, chair of the A.S. Bike Committee, the decision, made after the initiative was reviewed by the UCOP, who maintained that the University should fund this project since it is a “safety issue on campus.”</p>\n<p>“We knew that we had to take that advantage of the opportunity to have the University fund this,” Littleworth said in an email. “It makes a lot of sense. Students shouldn’t have to pay to make the campus a safe place.”</p>\n<p>UCOP’s recommendation to withhold the fee initiative is partially attributed to potential repercussions that may come from acknowledging the zone as a “safety issue,” according to Littleworth. If acknowledged by the administration, accidents at the intersection could become a legal liability for the campus.</p>\n<p>“If there was a major accident at an intersection documented as ‘unsafe’ that the university hadn’t taken care of, there could be an expensive lawsuit,” Littleworth said in an email.</p>\n<p>During the 2012-13 school year, the A.S. Bike Committee began the project after receiving complaints from students about the intersection and hearing about bicycle and pedestrian accidents occurring in that area. Since the conception of the idea, the Bike Committee has spent approximately $76,000 on manager fees, design fees and concept sketches for the proposed roundabout.</p>\n<p>Initially, during its campaigning period, the initiative did not garner enough signatures to make it onto the Spring ballot. But in March, A.S. Senators voted to forgo this and allow the initiative on.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Jimmy Villarreal, who voted for the initiative to be put on the ballot, said he wanted to give students the freedom to choose whether or not they wanted to improve the bike path intersection.</p>\n<p>“I think the students should be able to decide what they’re paying for,” Villarreal said. “I wanted to give them the option to build it.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Mac Kennedy, every year the UC Police Department receives about 30 to 40 bike accident reports per year while Student Health assists hundreds of accident victims a year. In light of these statistics, Kennedy said University administration should be responsible for student safety on the bike paths.</p>\n<p>While the process of retracting has only just begun, Kennedy said he and the Bike Committee feel confident that the University will choose to fund the project.</p>\n<p>“After communication with UCOP, they said it doesn’t make sense to fund it, so we’re pursuing university funding,” Kennedy said. “We’re confident that they’re going to understand this is a strong public threat to our safety on campus. We’ve already pretty much decided, and it doesn’t cost the university much money at all.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he anticipates that the final decision will be made by the end of this week. Currently, the Bike Committee is in collaboration with Vice Chancellor Michael Young regarding how to approach the project. Members of the Committee plan to meet with Marc Fisher, Senior Associate Vice Chancellor and Administrative Services and Campus Architect, next week to continue the discussion.</p>\n<p>Amber Munoz, a third-year comparative literature major and Vice Chair of the Isla Vista Community Relations Committee, said the unsafe intersection may damage UCSB’s reputation as a bike-friendly campus. She also said the area needs renovation regardless of whether or not the initiative is retracted.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen so many near or close accidents that have happened at that intersection, especially because there are so many students,” Munoz said. “Biking is a really intimidating factor for people who are coming to visit UCSB and the area should be seen as safe.”</p>\n<p>Littleworth said she is eager to begin negotiations with University administration regarding the funding of the project. She said she hopes to see the proposed roundabout completed before fall quarter of next year.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to the negotiations and hope to see this project completed during the summer,” Littleworth said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Rilla Peng contributed to this article.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/","id":3034,"author":{"id":189,"name":"Loree Lewis"},"related":[3033,3032,3031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Catalyst Requests Lock-in for Print Costs","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The students behind The Catalyst, a new student-run literary arts magazine, have requested a lock-in fee in the upcoming Associated Students election in an effort to ensure continued quarterly publica...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The students behind The Catalyst, a new student-run literary arts magazine, have requested a lock-in fee in the upcoming Associated Students election in an effort to ensure continued quarterly publications.</p>\n<p>A revival of the Catalyst Literary Journal, which ran from 1992 to 2007, the magazine is a student publication of the UCSB English Department that allows students across different disciplines to collaborate and showcase their creative art and writing. The proposed lock-in fee will charge undergraduates $1.08 a quarter, beginning in the fall quarter of the 2014 academic year and will go towards publication and distribution costs of The Catalyst.</p>\n<p>Of the $1.08 fee, $0.75 will go towards The Catalyst with the rest directed towards A.S. and administrative services as return-to-aid.</p>\n<p>The inaugural Winter 2014 issue of The Catalyst featured creative prose, poetry and academic writing juxtaposed with hand-drawn art and photos. All the work in the 80-page winter issue was submitted by UCSB students, however, the magazine is not limited to undergraduates; The Catalyst also accepts submissions from UCSB graduate students, faculty and alumni.</p>\n<p>Third-year English major Natalie O’Brien, who serves as The Catalyst’s editor in chief, said the proposed lock-in fee could “make or break” the magazine depending on whether or not it passes. According to O’Brien, the magazine staff relied on the UCSB English department, individual students and local donations to fund its first publication, which she does not see as being reliable in the future. O’Brien also said the magazine wants to ensure that it remains free of cost to students.</p>\n<p>“The costs of printing our magazine, especially in color, are staggering and we really need help from students,” O’Brien said.</p>\n<p>According to O’Brien, only 750 copies of Winter ’14 issue The Catalyst were printed and more than half of those went to attendees at the magazine’s launch party in January.</p>\n<p>If the initiative passes, O’Brien said she believes the magazine can more widely circulate around campus and Isla Vista. Otherwise, The Catalyst could be restricted to an online edition, she said.</p>\n<p>“We only made our magazine available in print at the Isla Vista Food Co-Op and at the English department, and we have had a tough time just keeping these two locations stocked with magazines,” O’Brien said. “We would hate to only publish our content online.”</p>\n<p>Although an online edition would be the most cost effective way to publish The Catalyst, O’Brien said she and contributors to the magazine want printed copies available to readers.</p>\n<p>First-year art major Vijay Masharani, whose artwork appears throughout the publication’s first issue, said he believes The Catalyst gives artists like himself a good opportunity to collaborate with individuals from other disciplines and majors.</p>\n<p>“Visual artists, sculptors, theorists, writers and critics work in an interdisciplinary manner that really poses an interesting challenge to the individual artist,” Masharani said. “The Catalyst promotes a mode of art that is more resonant because it represents a conversation between multiple people, as opposed to a monologue coming from one person.”</p>\n<p>Masharani said he believes working with others students to create artwork for The Catalyst has been invaluable in his maturation as an artist.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Mariah Tiffany also said she appreciates The Catalyst for being an effective outlet for her own creativity.</p>\n<p>“Although I am not an art major, I love photography and The Catalyst has been a great platform for me to exhibit my talents,” Tiffany said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/","id":3035,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[3034,3033,3032],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
