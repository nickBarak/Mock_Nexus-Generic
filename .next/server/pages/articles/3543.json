They met while deep sea fishing in Miami, Florida “over a decade ago,” John said teasingly.

We bought a tandem bicycle when we came to California. … Our lives were welded together on the tandem.”</p>\n<p>While John teaches various sociology courses, Janice focuses solely on the pair’s classes on human sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I’m just hired for sex,” Janice joked.</p>\n<p>“You sound like a sex worker,” John teased.</p>\n<p>The pair moved from randy to affectionate as Janice listed the numerous reasons she loves her husband, naming kindness, intelligence, sincerity and dedication, among others.</p>\n<p>“His cute little face,” she said. “He makes so many funny faces, you’d be amazed. … He’s a lot of fun. He’s dedicated to making our life as good as it can be together. And he fits in some cute little jeans.”</p>\n<p>“Superficial Janice,” James said in jest.</p>\n<p>James also expressed admiration for his significant other.</p>\n<p>“She creates so many wonderful moments for us,” he said. “Our life is charmed.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the pair stressed their dedication to physical fitness. John and Janice, 69 years old and 64 years old, respectively, hike regularly and are able to trek 3,200 ft. in one hour and 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>John also said that intimacy is crucial to a healthy relationship and taking frequent mini-vacations allow the pair to spend much-needed personal time with one another.</p>\n<p>“We spend a lot of time being intimate with each other so these vacations are very special,” he said. “We like the intimacy that comes from sitting and talking about plans; where to go next.”</p>\n<p><b>The Twins</b></p>\n<p>Charles and Dolly Mullin, both communication professors, have distinctive teaching methodologies, but are surprisingly alike in their personalities — a fit that makes the couple like two peas in a pod.</p>\n<p>The pair first realized the likeness as undergraduates at UCLA when pulling all-nighters to watch David Letterman and discuss Scottish music. According to Dolly, the two never tried to look their best during those long nights, which allowed them to fall in love with each other’s personalities instead of focusing on physical appearance.</p>\n<p>“It was certainly comfort and familiarity at first sight,” Charles said. “It was a perfect fit right away.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, the two eventually decided to attend UCSB for graduate school, where they stayed to teach asfaculty lecturers.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to get your Ph.D someplace and stay at that institution to teach,” he said. “We had more or less committed emotionally and spiritually to staying at UCSB, which may have factored into our decision to not go into a tenure track elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>Aside from admiring his intelligence and strong sense of principle, Dolly said she trusts her partner completely.</p>\n<p>“We think the same way on so many issues,” she said. “I trust his judgment on just about everything.”</p>\n<p>Charles, on the other hand, said he is thankful for Dolly’s selflessness.</p>\n<p>“You take care of me, which I appreciate,” he said. “You look after the things I don’t like to do for myself, like taxes and stuff. We both do stuff that the other person doesn’t want to.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the Mullins, the communication department, which has been dubbed Noah’s Ark, also houses four other couples.</p>\n<p>Although some married couples prefer to keep their professional lives separate from their personal ones, Dolly said working together can be beneficial.</p>\n<p>“We know each other’s stresses,” she said. “It’s hard [when you have] different jobs and don’t know why the other is worried.”</p>\n<p>Aside from working, living and volunteering together, the pair also commutes from Santa Ynez — a 50-minute drive — together. Charles joked that he forced Dolly to adopt a rural lifestyle.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you marry a person who’s optimal for you,” he said. “You marry them and mold them. … I sometimes like to say I dragged [Dolly] out there [to Santa Ynez].”</p>\n<p>“But I went willing,” Dolly said.</p>\n<p>“It’s like Green Acres,” Charles joked. “I’m Eddie Albert.”</p>\n<p>“And I’m Eva Gabor,” Dolly said, as though reading her husband’s mind.</p>\n<p><b>The Honeymooners</b></p>\n<p>Although married for eight years, physics professor Tommaso Treu and history professor Stefania Tutino can easily be mistaken for newlyweds.</p>\n<p>Aside from holding hands, exchanging loving glances and kissing, the pair is also so bright-eyed when speaking about each other that an onlooker would suspect they were honeymooners.</p>\n<p> The couple first met over a decade ago when attending Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. Their different academic callings, however, forced them to live apart during a portion of their relationship. The two finally reunited years later while pursuing post doctorate degrees at UCLA.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for two academic people [to maintain a relationship],” Stefania said. “There’s a lot of work behind it.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hard work, Tommaso said he would do anything for the pair to stay together.</p>\n<p>“She’s the most interesting, intelligent person I’ve met,” Tommaso said. “You never get bored with Stefania.”</p>\n<p>Thankfully, UCSB is a very supportive institution for spouses, the couple said.</p>\n<p>“They understand that academics are married to academics,” Tommaso said. “It’s a wise thing for the institution. [They] don’t want professors to constantly leave [to go visit spouses].”</p>\n<p>Despite specializing in distinct disciplines, the professors teach a class together, Stefania said.</p>\n<p>“We do a lot of cross-collaborations,” she said. “We teach a class on the origins of cosmology from a physics- history-religious studies perspective.”</p>\n<p>Working alongside each other sometimes creates competition, she noted.</p>\n<p>“Academics are competitive in many ways,” Stefania said. “It’s actually a way to make each other better. It fosters each other’s potential.”</p>\n<p>Like their contrasting areas of study, Stefania said the duo’s personalities are complementary.</p>\n<p>“It’s easy to be in different fields,” she said. “The same would be too close to home. Being in different fields makes it healthy.”</p>\n<p>“Healthier,” Tommaso added.</p>\n<p>The couple also has affectionate names for one another. Tommaso calls Stefania “gentleman,” while she calls him “Mr. Bennet” when annoyed, referencing Pride and Prejudice.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Stefania said Tommaso has had an immeasurable impact on her life.</p>\n<p>“When you spend a third of your life with someone, it’s hard to remember the way it was before,” she said. “We’ve been there for each other for a long time, at the most critical stages. We see each other grow, influencing as we observe.”</p>\n<p>Tommaso also said he has learned a great deal from his wife.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot easier to ask what didn’t she teach me,” he said.</p><div

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91419\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of UCSB</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal would demolish Ocean Road and cover the 16.7 acres of land up and down the street with up to 540 housing units — 180 two- and three-bedroom townhomes for sale and 360 rental units.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an unmet and sustained need for faculty and staff housing at UCSB, which has been exacerbated by Santa Barbara’s constrained and high-cost housing market,” the proposal wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The need for attainable, high-quality housing options remains a critical issue for recruitment and retention of faculty and staff at UCSB.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the proposal doesn’t specify the proposed costs of these units — only highlighting that they would be set at a “reasonable, market-based average sale price” —  it does note that according to a third-party site, home prices in Santa Barbara and Goleta over the last 30 days averaged $1.2 million, and that the average rent for the past five years was approximately $2,249, with a 98% occupancy rate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal noted that of the current faculty and staff housing options provided by UCSB, both </span><a href=\"https://www.oceanwalk.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ocean Walk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, made up of for-sale properties, and Sierra Madre Apartments, made up of rental properties, are at 100% capacity. The wait list for Ocean Walk housing is at 185 people, and the Sierra Madre waitlist had been capped at 200.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In addition to providing clear indications of interest and demand, survey responses also confirmed long commute times (over 45 minutes) and distances (over 25 miles) for a significant number of faculty and staff, further highlighting the need for housing options close to campus,” the proposal wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key differences of this project, compared to typical UCSB housing projects, is that it will include “30,000 to 55,000 gross square feet of retail space.” The university hopes to help alleviate the costs of the townhouses and apartments through a subsidy program, which will be funded, in part, by the “ground rent” generated by the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rental and retail portions of the Project are expected to be developed, owned, and managed under a long-term ground lease,” the proposal stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the housing and retail space, the proposal said that the project would include “realignment of the existing Ocean Road roadway and physical improvements for connections to Isla Vista, new and replacement parking for the community, and open space, vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian pathways.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91421\" style=\"width: 1030px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2018 article by The Current</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a publication run by UC Santa Barbara’s public affairs office, boasted that the project would create a “dynamic residential community” and “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">redefine the border between Isla Vista” — but that is exactly the problem that Isla Vistans had with a former version of the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly 15 years ago, in 2005, campus planners </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2005-10-26/project-renovates-ocean-road-to-aid-in-traffic-housing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a similar Ocean Road housing plan, which would involve 536 units divided into apartments, lofts and townhouses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was reported at the time that construction was scheduled to begin in 2007, but in 2009, the university postponed its attempt to demolish Ocean Road amidst severe public pressure to halt the project, the Nexus</span> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-01-28/officials-pause-ocean-road-proposal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in 2009</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-02-05/vision-2025-apt-to-give-ucsb-bad-eyesight/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">op-ed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the university’s previous attempt denounced the 2009 program, noting that the project would involve tearing down the famous eucalyptus trees that line Ocean Road; similarly, in recent months, a few citizens have shown up to Isla Vista Community Services District meetings expressing similar concerns about the trees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the current plan is approved, Student Health would also need to be relocated from its current location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2018 Current piece also said that “input from people both on and off campus will again be crucial, and multiple opportunities for such public discussions will be provided and welcomed every step of the way” — but no such publicization of the project has been prevalent until the Regents meeting last week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Outreach and community engagement were central to the original Ocean Road proposal and project approval, and they will remain important considerations throughout the project planning stage and beyond,” UCSB spokesperson Shelly Leachman said in an email about the project in June 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leachman added that the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of UCSB Community Housing Authority on campus had administered a survey to students, staff and faculty earlier in the year regarding the Ocean Road Housing project, and that the office planned to conduct additional surveys as the project planning continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act, the university will prepare an addendum to the 2010 LRDP Environmental Impact Report. T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hat addendum, along with designs, will be considered for approval by the UC Regents in a public meeting in January 2020.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal presented to the Regents updated that timeline, confirming that the UC Regents would be presented with the business terms for the project in the first financial quarter of 2020, and the design plans and “an environmental document pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act” in the second or third quarter of 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is “is currently in the final stages of a robust solicitation process” to select the developer for the project, according to the proposal, after which it will be able to “finalize the key business terms for the Project and to implement predevelopment agreements to finalize design, planning, entitlements, and Project approvals.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
