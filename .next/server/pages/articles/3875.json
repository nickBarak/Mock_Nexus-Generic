Judging from his apparent lack of balance, the deputies suspected the man was under the influence of a solid amount of alcohol. The fact that he was yelling at innocent passersby also helped the officers in the deduction.</p>\n<p>However, the 18-year-old man was not satisfied with his simple inebriation. Seemingly unaware of the deputies standing just paces away, the man asked aloud, “Do you know where I could score some weed?”</p>\n<p>Before he could ever get his answer, the pot-seeking soon-to-be-prisoner crossed paths with the police.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this drunken reveler did not spend the night blissfully forgetting where he put his belongings — deputies working the night shift at the Santa Barbara County Jail took care of that for him.</p>\n<p>My Name Is…<br>\nSunday, Feb. 24, 12:18 a.m. — Two males leaning against each other for support caught the attention of deputies patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>Officers spotted the 23-year-old man leaning head first against the outstretched arm of his comrade. The two, like drunken statues backlit by I.V.’s relentless debauchery, held this graceful posture for some time.</p>\n<p>But beauty is not meant to last and the two broke away and headed directly toward the officers, at which point the true extent of their intoxication came into clear focus.</p>\n<p>The deputies determined that the 23-year-old male was unable to care for himself and asked the man his name. He answered with his first name, but gave no hint of his surname.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked again several times, but the man simply smiled and shook his head, offering no answers. The officers asked him his date of birth and if he knew where he was, but with smiles abounding, he gave no answer.</p>\n<p>The deputies then asked if the man had his driver license, at which point he reached into his back pocket and produced his wallet.</p>\n<p>Yet, with his wallet out, the happy drunk was unable to find his license, even though it was clearly visible. The officer generously pointed it out to him, yet he was still unable to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>A smile goes a long way, however, and the deputies were kind enough to help the man out and retrieved his license for him.</p>\n<p>With the government-issued cheat sheet in hand, the severely confused man was still unable to provide officers with neither his last name nor his date of birth.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending remembrance of his name.<br>\n— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15994\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15994\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-27/police-blotter-23/","id":3875,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3874,3873,3872],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Blazing Saddles Mon., May 26, 12:03 a.m. – Deputies in a marked police car came across a truck parked in a fire lane on Seville Road.

Unable to conduct a stop due to traffic, the deputies followed the vehicle, which eventually made a right onto El Colegio Road and then a left onto Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>As the truck turned onto Stadium Road, the driver crossed the double yellow lines, prompting the deputies to pull him over.</p>\n<p>While standing at the driver’s side window, the officer immediately detected the pungent odor of burnt marijuana emanating from within the truck. The deputy asked if there was any pot in the car and the driver admitted that he and his passengers had hot-boxed the truck earlier that evening. He then assured the officer there wasn’t anymore weed – or at least he couldn’t remember there being anymore.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old male then produced a brightly colored pipe, complete with burnt residue. The driver told the deputies the piece belonged to his passenger, however the man riding shotgun was unable to produce a valid medical marijuana card.</p>\n<p>The driver was then asked to step out of the truck while an officer checked the vehicle for any hidden drugs. Unfortunately for this stoner, the floor beneath the passenger seat just wasn’t a good hiding spot and, after a short search, the deputy produced a small baggie containing less than an ounce of weed.</p>\n<p>The red-eyed Rasta was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of a controlled substance and was required to pee into a cup. He was later released into the care of his sober passenger, pending a later court date.</p>\n<p>Brown-Bagging It<br>\nTues., May 27, 4:28 p.m. – Officers on an afternoon patrol received a complaint of an intoxicated subject disturbing pedestrians in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, deputies spotted a 47-year-old male staggering about the park, yelling at an innocent bystander. As if his actions – and his breath – weren’t tips enough, the belligerent day-drinker was also toting a 40-shaped brown paper bag.</p>\n<p>The officer told the man to take a seat, but before obliging, the drunkard poured out his beer and tossed the bottle behind him. Dutifully, the deputy went to fetch the litter.</p>\n<p>The officer placed the bottle back in front of the elderly drunk, only to have him pick it up and throw it once more.</p>\n<p>Deciding it was best to just leave the bottle as is, the deputy asked the man – whose eyes were bloodshot and watering – how much alcohol he had consumed. The man yelled back, “I don’t care. Take me to jail.”</p>\n<p>The deputy didn’t have to be told twice. He arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-30/police-blotter-26/","id":3872,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3871,3870,3869],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. - On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A-B-C, Easy as 1-2-3?<br>\nSaturday, Jan. 12, 12:29 a.m. – On Embarcadero del Norte, a group of men yelling at each other attracted the attention of a large crowd, and, eventually, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>The officers spotted a 23-year-old man who had actually had a run-in with I.V.’s finest earlier that night. The reason: an inappropriate tirade of deafening insults.</p>\n<p>The man – who seemed to have his vocal dial turned up to 11 – told the deputies that he just wanted to go home, all the while trying to dip, duck and dodge the questions thrown his way.</p>\n<p>He managed to count how many shots he’d had that night – eight- but could not seem to remember his alphabet for the officers.</p>\n<p>After several earnest attempts, trying such letter combinations as the commonly mistaken “K-I-Z” and the just barely incorrect “U-P,” he admitted to the officers, “No, I cannot say my ABCs.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending successful completion of his 1-2-3s.</p>\n<p>She’s a Lady<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 1:21 a.m. – After receiving a call from residents on Camino del Sur that a woman was face down on the grass throwing up, an IVFP officer found the19-year-old.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the woman, she managed to compose herself enough to speak, and, as the officer noted, was exceedingly polite.</p>\n<p>Despite her good manners, the woman proved a bit untrustworthy. She told the officer that she had gone to a party with her friends, but that like all underage students at UCSB, she only drank water.</p>\n<p>The woman, who had soiled her jeans, repeatedly denied drinking any alcohol. Her story, however, proved about as watertight as a pasta strainer when a test administrated by the deputies showed her blood alcohol content level at .212.</p>\n<p>Once the woman realized she was caught in a lie, she apologized profusely for causing trouble and gracefully faced her night in jail, wet pants and all.</p>\n<p>Close Encounters of the Leafy Kind<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 12:52 a.m. – Officers patrolling Sabado Tarde Road saw a woman stumble down the street, lose her balance and run straight into a bush.</p>\n<p>Refusing to let a mere shrub get the best of her, the 19-year-old woman recovered, brushed away the stray twigs from her hair, and continued down the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the deputies, the woman said she was coming from a party on Sueno Road and that all she had to drink was a beer and a shot.</p>\n<p>The officer questioned the validity of her alcohol consumption, and asked the woman if she had any more to drink. She told him, “No, I really did not. I am just a lightweight.”</p>\n<p>When informed of her encounter with the foliage, the woman said she did not remember running into the bush, but reassured the officers that she had talked to many people that night.</p>\n<p>The officers – still on Sabado – asked the woman if she was aware of her surroundings. The woman told the deputies she was on El Nido Lane coming from Cordoba Road – negating both reality and what she had earlier told the officers.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and taken to the IVFP station.

By the time the officers had arrived, he had disappeared.</p>\n<p>The friend told the deputies he had allowed the man inside the apartment but that, once inside, his drunken friend started to verbally abuse his girlfriend and needed to be kicked out. It was at this point that he jumped the fence and started his assault on the sliding glass door.</p>\n<p>After avoiding the police, the man resumed his quest at the front door, prompting his friend to call the police a second time. When the deputies arrived, they heard the desperate man shouting, “Come on, man. I’m going to jail. Let me in!”</p>\n<p>The officers told the man to wait until he was sober to talk to his girlfriend and that he should go straight home, lest he be arrested for public intoxication. He agreed, telling the deputies that he would not be a problem anymore.</p>\n<p>Thinking he had given the Isla Vista Foot Patrol the slip, he returned a few minutes later to bang on the door a third time. The police met up with him in the parking lot behind the apartment and arrested him – ending his marathon of obnoxious knocking.</p>\n<p>He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Rambling Man<br>\nSat., May 3, 11:25 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man struggling to walk the line.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 18-year-old male wove back and forth across the street, clearly intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The man then lost his balance and veered sidelong into a parked car. Unabashed, he continued on, but soon lost his balance again and fell into the next available parked car.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the unsteady stroller, who could barely stand still without completely losing his poise.</p>\n<p>The deputies began to question him, but soon realized that along with his balance, the man had lost his ability to comprehend what was happening. He stood there with a blank expression on his face and was unable to focus on the deputy when addressed.</p>\n<p>The officer asked oblivious man where he had been headed, but when he tried to answer, his speech was nothing but a stream of incoherent ramblings. His words were horribly slurred and he could barely put together a sentence.</p>\n<p>The officers, convinced the confused wanderer was unable to get home safely, arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Marathon<br>\nSun., May 4, 2:20 p.m. – Officers taking a break in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station on Pardall Road were interrupted by the loud remarks of two passersby.</p>\n<p>A 19-year old male and his friend walking eastbound down Pardall Road decided to tempt fate by loudly making snide remarks about Isla Vista’s finest as they passed the open door of the police station. Only, this pair of day drinkers made one glaringly obvious mistake: One of them had decided to drunkenly taunt the police with a red cup in his hand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, however, opted not to stop the pair and let them continue on their way, red cup and all.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them, these two Sunday partiers apparently hadn’t gotten enough thrills on their first pass, because 20 minutes later they returned walking in the opposite direction – the red cup still firmly in hand.</p>\n<p>If the deputies still had reservations about stopping the two, they were wiped away when they heard their now incoherent remarks drift in through the open door.</p>\n<p>An officer stopped the cup-wielding man and asked him what it contained. The defeated daredevil confessed that he was carrying vodka and that he was only 19 years of age.</p>\n<p>When asked when he had begun his daytime drinking, the man proudly stated that he had been continuously drinking since the night before.</p>\n<p>Apparently unimpressed, the deputy arrested the man and had him transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/police-blotter-24/","id":3874,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3873,3872,3871],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
