No gain, no loss. Either way, that’s eight consecutive years not qualifying for the playoffs.</p>\n<p>However, there is a different energy in the city.

At times this season, it was visible. Sacramento beat excellent playoff teams such as Houston, Miami and Portland. However, the Kings lacked consistency, especially on defense, falling to some of worst teams in the NBA.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest positives to take away from this season is that the front office proved it is willing to do whatever it takes to make the team good now. General Manager Pete D’Alessandro made great strides with Rudy Gay early in the season, giving Kings a “Big Three” of their own in Gay, point guard Isaiah Thomas and center DeMarcus Cousins.</p>\n<p>Looking to next season, the biggest need is to ensure all the big pieces to the current squad stay intact, unless the Kings can trade or sign a franchise-changing player. But it needs to be a player who management has great faith will stay in Sacramento. There’s talk of trying to trade for All-Star Kevin Love, but it’s risky to sign a player that could pack up and move a year after signing when his contract expires.</p>\n<p>Thomas is a restricted free agent during the offseason. There’s currently talk of trading Thomas, but the young underdog has proved he can hold his own in this league and be a great point guard.</p>\n<p>Last season, Thomas averaged 20.3 points, 6.3 assists and 2.9 rebounds per game. Obtaining another point guard would be smart, but having the ball in Thomas’ hands led to nothing but good things last season. Don’t mess with it now.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Gay also can become an unrestricted free agent if he decides not to exercise his player option worth $19.3 million for the 2014-15 season. Gay had the best year of his career with California’s capital city, setting career-highs in points per game, field goal percentage and assists per game. His ability to score at the small forward position and his versatility greatly aided the Kings. Keep him in purple and black too.</p>\n<p>As for the last member of the Big Three, Cousins needs to mature, and fast. The Kings need him on the court, not in foul trouble or being suspended for technical fouls. He led the NBA in ‘T’s’ again this season.</p>\n<p>Cousins has the talent and frame to be a franchise player. He was great this year, improving his efficiency on the offensive end, but if he can mentally become strong to the point where he’s not committing silly turnovers and taking possessions off on defense, he could easily be an all-star next season. It’s time for him to step up and lead by example.</p>\n<p>The biggest area of need for the Kings in the offseason is at the shooting guard position. Rookie Ben McLemore simply isn’t ready. This season, he showed he has bad hands; he needs great improvement with his ball handling and he’s not the shooter anyone expected him to be.</p>\n<p>In an overall disappointing season for McLemore, the Kings traded Marcus Thornton, showing the Kings want McLemore to be a big part of their future. With drastic improvement, maybe he could be, but not now.<br>\nThe Kings didn’t have the greatest luck in the lottery, receiving the No. 8 pick, but Sacramento was the first to put that pick up for a trade in order to ensure immediate talent and success. It’s certainly the smartest tactic for the organization right now.</p>\n<p>Sacramento is in need of consistent perimeter shooting. A good passer would be favorable. It needs players who can play defense and buy into Malone’s style.</p>\n<p>I don’t expect Jason Terry to stay, so some veteran leadership could greatly benefit the young squad too.</p>\n<p>As long as management continues on its plan of immediate success, the Kings have players they can build around.</p>\n<p>The city is ready to win. The front office has the right mentality to win. The players need to believe they can win. It’s time to make it happen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of April 28th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55650\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55650\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/","id":3254,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3253,3252,3251],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Leaders for the Next Great Japanese Pitcher","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Masahiro Tanaka might be the next great Japanese pitcher to come to the MLB.

He stands at 6’2” with a smooth, repeatable delivery that results in pinpoint control (183 strikeouts to 32 walks in 2013).</p>\n<p>Although he doesn’t have the overwhelming power fastball of the other Asian pitcher who came to America in recent memory with this much hype, 6’5” Texas Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish, Tanaka’s heater sits in the low 90’s and comes with a great horizontal slider to offset it. His out-pitch is a split-finger fastball that will instantly be among the best in baseball and bring back memories of Roger Clemens. Like Darvish, Tanaka utilizes a wide repertoire of pitch types to keep hitters off-balance, including off-speed pitches and a variety of cuts and sinking breaks on his fastball.</p>\n<p>In style and professional background, Tanaka resembles Hiroki Kuroda of the Yankees and Hisashi Iwakuma of the Mariners more than Darvish, but the level of success in Japan is more reminiscent of the latter. Given that all three pitchers are Cy Young contenders at their best, Tanaka faces high hopes and expectations. His predecessors established a blueprint for a successful Japan to U.S. transition, and while not every import is a success story (see: Daisuke Matsuzaka), Tanaka has shown the potential to be the greatest of them all.</p>\n<p>The question on everyone’s mind remains: Where will Tanaka sign? The courting process is coming to an end with teams making their pitches and final offers. According to the new international posting rules, Tanaka must sign by Friday, which means he will have to announce his decision by Wednesday in order to allow a couple days for the necessary physical examination.</p>\n<p>Five teams have been named as “finalists” for Tanaka’s services. The New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers are widely regarded as the favorites to sign him, for a variety of reasons. The Yankees are in desperate need of a new ace pitcher and are opening up the checkbook with no further regard for the luxury tax threshold. In previous years, what would have been a sure-thing signing for the Yankees is not so concrete today. They have the money and the need, but Tanaka is said to prefer the west coast. His wife is a pop star in Japan, and the bright lights of Hollywood might affect his decision. If Tanaka wants to play for a contender while also being the unquestioned staff ace, the Yankees might have the edge. If Tanaka wants to play for the best team on paper with no regard for his spot in the rotation, he might choose Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers under Stan Kasten are the new big spenders in baseball and have yet to make a big splash this offseason. Even after signing Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw to long-term contracts, money is still no object for Los Angeles, especially considering they will have the huge contracts of Josh Beckett, Chad Billingsley and Dan Haren off the books by 2015, clearing up over $40 million a year in payroll.</p>\n<p>Kasten worked for the Atlanta Braves during their 1990’s dynasty, when Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz dominated the National League East. He obviously has similar aspirations with this Dodger team, and a rotation of Kershaw, Greinke, Tanaka and Hyun-Jin Ryu would be really difficult to beat in a seven-game series.</p>\n<p>Three other teams, the Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox, have also made offers to Tanaka. Arizona in particular plans to offer every penny they can scrounge up in an attempt to woo Tanaka. The D’Backs need to take their team to the next level to compete with the other juggernauts in the National League West, and getting a great pitcher for the next decade would be a good place to start.</p>\n<p>The Cubs are rebuilding under the guidance of Theo Epstein and would offer Tanaka the chance to slowly adjust to American baseball while comfortably being the face of the franchise when they finally start to contend in a couple years. The White Sox do not have a ton of appeal, but are making a strong push anyway. Consider Seattle and the Los Angeles Angels to be dark horses in the Tanaka sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>Whatever team wins the bidding for Tanaka, expect the deal to average around $20 million a year. Even though he has no MLB experience, $120 million over six years seems like a fair price to pay for a pitcher who is just entering his prime.</p>\n<p>Based on teams’ spending power, ability to contend, location, international marketing appeal and long-term track record, the Dodgers seem to have the slight edge on the Yankees for signing Tanaka. However, nobody will really know his priorities until a decision is made. Based on Tanaka’s Twitter post expressing his inability to reach a final decision, expect the race to come down to a photo finish at the end of the deadline.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of january 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/","id":3251,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3250,3249,3248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recap: External Vice President for Statewide Affairs Forum","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EVPSA-forum.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EVPSA-forum.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The two EVPSA candidates are third-year Alexandra Leal Silva and second-year Daevionne Beasley.

He also noted that the general student body “isn’t necessarily up to par” on what the organization does and where student fees go, so he wants to change that and make sure students voices are “head at a state-wide and national level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has been working within the EVPSA office since her first year at UCSB – first as an EVPSA fellow, then as a community organizing director, and then as the legislative director – and now feels that she now has enough experience to run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as students are the future of the state, of this county, and we deserve to have a space in these vocations and be able to speak to what it is you need in order to be successful, what our students need in order to be successful.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any experience organizing UCSB students at the statewide level, such as lobby, or with UC wide-work? What have your experiences shown you about some of the issues facing students today? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has had a lot of experience lobbying for students, again referencing her past three years in the EVPSA office. She further noted that she is a member of Lobby Corps, and has been organizing student trips to the U.S. Senate, the legislator and Capitol Hill through this entire past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need to hear where they’re at because they are living in this bubble, this congressional bubble. I’m going to be able to pop that and say, ‘hey, we are your students. We are who elected you and you need to be able to listen to us and take our student concerns into value.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley referenced his work on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/summer-cal-grant-bill-reintroduced/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 3153</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a bill to extend the Cal Grant into summer sessions, stating that he and other students would “drive up to Sacramento at ungodly hours to testify at these hearings and train different students on what they’re testifying on behalf of UC.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve really seen the beauty and power that comes with organizing students. I absolutely love it and I appreciate every moment of getting to help students fight for the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Can you name some of the communities on the UCSB campus that you believe are the most marginalized? As the new EVPSA, how would you attempt to amplify these voices that you have mentioned and how do you ensure that students of all backgrounds are represented?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said Black students are the most marginalized community at UCSB, making up 4% of the campus. He said Black students don’t get the same institutional support that other groups may have, and said that either he or someone on his staff would be in attendance at Black Student Union (BSU) board meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said that while he cannot speak to the experiences of other marginalized students on campus, he would make sure to compose his office of people from different backgrounds as to increase representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to legislation… on the floor right now, to reaffirm the standards for deadly force for police officers and UCPD and California as a whole, we really need Black students to advocate on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she wants to listen to all voices on campus, and would take those concerns to the “state, to the federal government, to the Regents because [everyone’s] experiences matter.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EVPSA is a servant to its community. It’s time to take that to the next level and I’m ready to serve my students at any capacity.” </span></p>\n<p><b>In the past year, have you had any direct involvement with the EVPSA office, and whether you have or not, what would you change about the office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva repeated that fact that she has been in the office these past three years, noting the hardships that came with not having an EVPSA this past year. She added that her work as a Resident Assistant and as a UCSB tour guide gives her a “unique perspective” and further knowledge as to how to serve students best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley also referenced the lack of an EVPSA during this past year, stating that “put students in a very hard position.” He added that the lack of someone in that position forced students into “non-institutional routes” to try and make change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he worked with 2017-2018 EVPSA Kristin Hsu during his first year, going on lobby trips and advocating for extending the Cal Grant. </span></p>\n<p><b>Thanks to the amazing work from UCSB’s voter registration volunteer coalition, UCSB has set national records on voter registration and voter turnout. How would you work with UCSB’s student-run voter registration coalition to increase voter turnout even further into 2020? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said it’s “absolutely incredible” that UCSB has one of the highest registered voters out of any campus in the nation. He said that while civic engagement is already very important to UCSB students, that would be expanded to work with more organizations on campus by tabling and registering people to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know you might feel a little bit discouraged with the political climate right now, and it’s very easy to think that, ‘oh, national or any type of election doesn’t matter [because] our voices aren’t heard.’ But I’m here to say… that is not true. Each and every single voice counts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced the UC coordinator position within the office,  who “works tirelessly throughout the year to reinvigorate the [registration volunteer coalition program].” She added onto Beasley’s point by stating that she will expand that role, while also working to include the voices of students who don’t have the ability to vote. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you plan on getting students interested in attending EVPSA functions such as Regents meetings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said that accessibility has been an issue not just within the EVPSA office, but within A.S. overall. She said she would work to be as “transparent as possible.” She also noted that the office should table toward the beginning of the year in order to gauge issues that students care about, and then set up a system that would alert them when the office is doing work on an issue they care about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The work that these students are doing is fueled by passion and grit and the will to serve, and we need to be able to highlight that and show students, ‘these are what your students are doing. This is why they care. This is how you can get involved.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his work as a Resident Assistant allowed him to see that marketing is the key to making sure students attend events. He said he wouldn’t let students know about events through “a robotic way, like through email.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Considering the budget restraints nationwide, what specific portion of the budget and Higher Education Act would you advocate for? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said specific numbers cannot be counted until it is known how much tax revenue California has. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation as a whole needs to prioritize education, needs to put that at the forefront, because education builds the leaders for tomorrow… Education is a right and people need to be educated on the issues that they’re fighting for.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced California Governor Gavin Newsoms’ budget that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-newsom-allocates-400-million-to-uc-system-aiming-to-increase-student-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released earlier this year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She noted that while his goal for the UC system to intake more students is “fabulous,” it is ultimately hard to accommodate more students because “we can barely accommodate the ones we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re talking about budget asks, what we’re advocating for, we need to be looking at things like basic needs. We need to be looking at things and making sure we’re funding our resources. We need to be looking at things like deferred maintenance – we have buildings falling apart, we have elevators that you wouldn’t dare step in because you value your life.” </span></p>\n<p><b>What would be the very first issue you will tackle if you are elected as EVPSA? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said the first thing she would tackle is financial aid expansion. She added that she wants to bring back the pell grant and wants to look into expanding the middle class scholarship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without financial aid, I wouldn’t even be standing up here. You want to talk about subsidized housing, food stamps? That is me. Still will probably be me for a while, but it’s because of financial aid that I’m able to attend this university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said he wants to make sure that marginalized students’ voices are “uplifted and heard.” He said that, if elected, he would “bring these people that are often put at the bottom of the social hierarchy and make sure they’re brought to the top.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t have one person of color or one marginalized student there and expect them to advocate on behalf of everyone that’s not present. My first task in the office will be making sure that I have a diverse enough staff to be able to bring some of the issues [to me] that need to be talked about.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

/ Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill, introduced by California Senator Connie M. Leyva in December 2018, passed with 28 yeses and 10 noes. It would require all on-campus California public universities to provide the abortion pill at student health clinics, including UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Recent efforts across our country make it absolutely clear that women’s rights, particularly access to abortion, are under attack,” Leyva said in a </span><a href=\"https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-05-20-senate-passes-leyva-bill-ensuring-college-students%E2%80%99-access-medication-abortion\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While other states are taking a giant step back to the days of outright misogyny and forced pregnancy, California continues to lead the nation by reaffirming the constitutional right to access abortion care without delay, including at student health centers on public university campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the press release, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leyva notes that “the lack of access to comprehensive and accessible reproductive care can hinder the well-being and academic success of college students,” adding that low income students and students of color are often disproportionately affected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of the UC or CSU student health center</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> currently provide abortion by “medication techniques,” according to the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 16, 2018, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine released a study announcing Mifeprex – the abortion pill – is </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safe and effective</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a statement Leyva echoed in her Monday press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pill has an approximate 95% success rate, according to the study. Mifeprex was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill (SB) 24 is the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/state-senator-reintroduces-bill-to-ensure-medication-abortion-access-at-public-universities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second version</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of an “abortion pill” bill to go through the California legislature. Its similar predecessor, also authored by Leyva, failed to pass after former Governor Jerry Brown </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-30/governor-brown-vetoes-abortion-pill-bill/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vetoed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it in September 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his decision to veto the bill, Brown cited a study that stated the average distance between abortion providers and on-campus communities was five to seven miles – a distance, he said, that made the bill “not necessary.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SB 24 would give $200,000 to each public university health center for equipment, facility and security upgrades, staff reimbursement and training staff, among other uses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An additional $200,000 each would also be provided to both the UC System and the California State University system to pay for “24-hour, backup medical support by telephone to patients who have obtained abortion by medical techniques at a public university student health center,” one-time fees for providing “telehealth” services, bill specialist consultation and for “maintaining a system of financial reporting” of the fund. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The money would come from “private funds” rather than student fees or university general funds monies, according to the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed by the California Assembly and signed by now-California Governor Gavin Newsom, all student health centers would be required to carry the pill by Jan. 1, 2023. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill’s text in full can be viewed </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB24\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
