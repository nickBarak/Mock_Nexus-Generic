We are facing an unprecedented amount of pressure right now, trying to figure out how the decisions made by us and for us will affect our futures. Politically charged music has been created throughout the years for this very reason and have consequentially become classic anthems of unrest. There is a new class of songs that have been created with the same purpose and carry the same weight that political songs of the past did for our parents.</p>\n<p>Baby Boomers gave way to Generation X, and Generation X gave way to Millennials. Each generation of young people comes with their own set of large-scale anxieties and therefore creates art to serve as both a response and a relic as time goes on. Younger generations do not only serve as tastemakers in culture, but they also have the power to completely shift the tide of politics. This is especially important in this election because Tuesday’s outcome does not only have obvious partisan and economic implications, but monumental cultural implications as well. We can confront this in the best way <em>we</em> know how: Let’s cling to our technology, put our earphones on and reflect on politically aware songs of the past and present.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol>\n<li>“Mr. November” by The National</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This song was written during the latter half of George W. Bush’s second term. The National seem to scrutinize career politicians like Bush: blue-blooded, Ivy League men who have consistently led our country. The titular “Mr. November” churns through an overwrought, aggressive internal monologue. “I won’t fuck us over, I’m Mr. November,” lead singer Matt Berninger sings in a way that strains his voice beyond comfort. The pressures leading the country pose to any potential leader are captured by the song’s pounding, kick-crash drums that carry the song’s angst to unfathomable heights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZjszc2YOAE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>“Young Americans” by David Bowie</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For clarification’s sake, Bowie was British in every single sense of the word. Even from the other side of the ocean, however, he was fascinated by our way of handling political unrest: specifically, the widespread uneasiness that characterized Nixon’s presidency and how young people acted upon the way they felt. This and Bowie’s use of elements from soul music of the ‘70s, characterized the album <em>Young Americans</em> as a whole. This song is upbeat, which makes it easier to find positivity in being unestablished but still in control of our futures.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSHY1_ux8rs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>“Fortunate Son” by Creedence Clearwater Revival</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a communication class I am taking this quarter, the professor screened an advertisement featuring this iconic track written by war veteran and lead singer of CCR, John Fogerty. It was an advertisement for jeans; denim as a symbol of classic American ideals is analogous to apple pie. However, the professor mentioned the irony of this song being used in the commercial as a positive representation of being an American citizen because it is a blatant criticism of young men being drafted for the Vietnam War. America, of course, is not currently under the threat of war, but it is important to remember that although for different reasons, young people in the ‘60s were facing just as much — if not more — discontent with our country as we are now.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ec0XKhAHR5I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>“Holy Shit” by Father John Misty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Singer-songwriter, amateur comedian and all-around magnetic persona Josh Tillman, also known as Father John Misty, is famous for his commentary on the state of love as it relates to everything. Whether it be religion, technology or politics, he glides through it all, acoustic guitar and silky voice softening his tongue-in-cheek criticisms. In this track from his sophomore effort <em>I Love You, Honeybear</em>, his disillusionment with the issues our country is constantly bombarded with is clear. He is a part of the group of people in the grey area between Generation X and Millennials, and his music reflects his uncertainty in his position. Tillman is well aware of how the problems we are facing are affecting us, but he is unsure of how to confront them.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TXdtZLrsZc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>“What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of the many stories I’ve heard from my mother about my great-grandfather, one of the fondest is her memory of this song by Marvin Gaye, his favorite classic soul track. My own memories of him are blurry because he passed away when I was young, but I can imagine him sitting at the kitchen table, shaking his head at all of the confusion going on in the world and tapping his cigarette into an ash tray. The finger snaps and doo-wop singing in the background of the record give it a pool hall feel, but it is instantly elevated by the impassioned lyrics and string orchestration in the foreground. This song, like “Fortunate Son,” is anti-Vietnam, but it is more of a plea than a protest. With the current state of conflict within this country, this would still be my grandfather’s favorite song if he were alive. Because certain tracks have a way of bridging gaps between multiple generations, it is just as relevant to me as it was to him.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-kA3UtBj4M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>“Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although Dylan is practically the father of musical activism, this track is not explicitly political. “The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,” he sings, as though he is soothing a crying child, and it is a sentiment which can quell the worry of almost any problem. Perhaps the most overwhelming emotion we are feeling this election season is uncertainty. No matter who you are voting for, the outcome this year is quite uncertain. But, in a way, it is comforting to know it is floating somewhere in the universe, and we will figure it out very soon.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vWwgrjjIMXA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

As a curtain of fog swirled beneath their feet, a singular point of light oscillated back and forth across a great black backdrop. Like Blake’s music, it was minimal yet incredibly transfixing.</p>\n<p>The audience eagerly followed Blake’s every move as he led them through a maze of his works, both old and new. “I’m gonna try and play some of my newer material,” he announced before diving into his famous cover of Feist’s “Limit to Your Love” from his self-titled debut back in 2011. This is how James Blake operates; he sets up rules for the listener, and then shatters them into millions of glittering bits almost immediately after they’ve been formed. During “Modern Soul,” for example, a pulsing white rectangle we’d grown to accept as a central part of Blake’s backdrop suddenly rotated into a brilliant, multicolored ring, leaving everyone in the room subsumed in the best possible way.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although they were originally intent on retaining their air of ruthless politeness, the crowd of sedate Santa Barbarans were finally pulled from their theater seats during his <em>excellent</em> remix of U.K. dubstep act Untold’s “Stop What You’re Doing.” According SB local David Shin, “We didn’t expect this type of energy! For him to bring everyone out of their seats like this … it was unreal.” And unreal it was; I’d never seen a crowd dance in a way so sensual yet collectively understated.

The tawny synth maestro clearly loves putting on a show (I’d never known the Clavia Nord 4 to be a full-bodied instrument!), but after spending a set in his presence you get the feeling he’s there for the audience, not for himself. However, Blake’s musical performance really only made for half of the concert experience. The background visuals by abstract artist Matt Clark — current creative director of United Visual Artists — were perfect ekphrases of Blake’s sound. When coupled with intricate lighting changes of every shape and color on the spectrum, they made for the most thoroughly audio-visual experience I’ve ever witnessed. Apart from a minor technical which incited Blake to charmingly scrap a song in the middle of it, the performance went off without a hitch.</p>\n<p>Nearing the show’s finale, Blake and the band finally gave into chants from the front few rows, tiptoeing their way into 2013’s “Retrograde,” Blake’s most popular track. No matter how many times you listen to it, there’s always a certain subtlety to Blake’s sound; it sneaks up on you. Even though everyone in attendance knew this track by heart, when it finally swelled into the chorus it was as if we were standing at the feet of an eclipse.</p>\n<p>Paying homage to his long-time fans as well as his own roots, Blake finished the set with “The Wilhelm Scream” from his aforementioned self-titled. The song is a cover of one his father, James Litherland, wrote. Even through the electric fervor and downtempo drum rhythms, you can really hear the affection in Blake’s voice. Through Blake’s traditional style of minimalist repetition, the song builds upon a wall of soothing reverb like a set of waves gradually overtaking a shore. The end result is a wall of noise reminiscent of one of My Bloody Valentine’s famous “holocaust sections,” but with the intent of melting the audience into a puddle of their own sentiments rather than reducing them to dust.</p>\n<p>After a scant few minutes of frenzied cheers, Blake returned by his lonesome to perform a serene, two-song encore. As his solemn silhouette casually lit up the empty backdrop, he serenaded us with his cover of Joni Mitchell’s “A Case of You,” leaving more than a few eyes in the room in a state of pleasant dampness.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73315\" style=\"width: 4414px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1575840009\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73315\" data-attachment-id=\"73315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/james-blake-arlington-theatre-oct-18th-2016/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=4404%2C3146&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4404,3146\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct  18th 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73315 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct 18th 2016.

So do you think you could … let this one just be me?”</p>\n<p>As I sat there mulling over how I’d never be asked to <em>shut the fuck up</em> so pleasantly again in my life, Blake, voice alone, began spinning the first verses of “Measurements.”</p>\n<p>“God damn …” a man in front of me whispered, clearly struggling to contain his whoops of pleasure. In the most wonderfully masturbatory show of musicianship I’d ever seen, Blake proceeded to harmonize with himself six or seven times over, his vocal cords weaving a veritable tapestry of sound. These voices then gradually trickled off one by one as people stooped down to grab their jackets and purses, and Blake’s set closed gracefully like the bud of a morning glory at dusk.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73364\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73364\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/","id":6747,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6746,6745,6744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Anoushka Shankar Charms Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3284-1.jpg?resize=306%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3284-1.jpg?resize=306%2C306&ssl=1","description":"Anoushka Shankar brought her intricate skill and her international musical background to Campbell Hall on Monday night with a concert celebrating her new album Land of Gold.

The murmuring chatter of the audience began to die down until the only perceptible sound was a steady note from the ensemble’s backing track. The ensemble waited with readiness at their instruments as Shankar gently tuned her sitar. She paused, then with a graceful flick of her wrist she began to fill the theater with clear, plucking notes.</p>\n<p>Anoushka Shankar brought her intricate skill and her international musical background to Campbell Hall on Monday night with a concert celebrating her new album <em>Land of Gold</em>. The renowned sitar player and composer has been performing since age 13 and has received five Grammy Award Nominations. Her original compositions seek to use the traditionally Indian sitar across various genres and in both classical and modern styles. <em>Land of Gold </em>seeks to bring cultures together.</p>\n<p>“It’s moments like these where there’s a connection with you, a connection with us,” Shankar said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The concert was dynamic and varied throughout, with changing styles, different combinations of instruments and rapidly shifting tones. The fast tempo and mixture of instruments in “Secret Heart” got the audience’s feet tapping from the start. Sanjeev Shankar’s high, clear notes on the shehnai kept pace with the quick plucking of the sitar in perfect harmony. Manu Delago added lower harmony on the hang with smooth tapping from one end of his instrument to the other. During the quiet interludes of the song, the drawn-out notes of the shehnai provided a dramatic difference from the pounding beat and full sound.</p>\n<p>“Dissolving Boundaries” began with gentle notes from the sitar, creating a relaxing atmosphere. As Shankar began increasing the tempo of her strumming and plucking, Tom Farmer’s soft piano notes joined in rhythmic melody. The building combinations of instruments in harmony were intercut with moments of only slow sitar plucking. Suddenly and jarringly, the music was interrupted by a news sound bite playing, a newscaster reporting on an influx of refugees in a professional tone. The musicians continued playing as the sound bite faded to become part of the background rhythm, melding into the song. Shankar had included the newscast to express the larger theme of her album. She explained, “The process of making this music was in response to the current refugee crisis.”</p>\n<p>The hardships of refugees and the themes of fear and the unknown were explored further in “Crossing The Rubicon.” Shankar described her ideas of people crossing the Rubicon River or refugees travelling to a new country as people “going all the way.” She said solemnly, “This music is an interpretation of what it must be like for those people.” The song began slowly and ominously with a delicate melody on the hang and slow sitar strumming, creating a mournful tone. The tempo and volume began increasing gradually as Shankar’s notes on the sitar became more harsh and pronounced. The building music created an increasing feeling of suspense. The sudden burst of booming bass and pounding drums filled the theatre in the song’s climactic moment, as though mimicking the rush of fleeing people.</p>\n<p>The entire ensemble truly demonstrated their rapid skills during “Last Chance.” Quiet trills from Shankar’s sitar and occasional booms from Farmer’s bass created a mysterious atmosphere in the song’s opening. Unexpectedly, a quick pounding beat from Delago’s small, hand-held drum signaled the beginning of a jolting tempo increase. Shankar’s hands flew up and down the sitar with lightning fast precision, bringing the audience to their feet with applause. Quick, powerful bursts from the bass added body to the pulsing rhythm that vibrated throughout the theatre. The fluidity of Shankar’s notes increased as lights flashed around the theatre, resembling a rock concert.</p>\n<p>As the cheering and whistling from the audience began to die down, Shankar introduced her last piece, smiling as she said, “I’m trying to end with a little bit of hope.” The song, “Reunion,” expressed a lighthearted tone with its major key and quick, light plucking on the sitar. Delago’s soft beat complimented the gentle melody and left pauses for Shankar’s sitar to pierce the stillness with clear high notes. All instruments in the ensemble came together at the song’s end along with a prerecorded chorus of voices to create a sense of unity.</p>\n<p><em>Land of Gold</em> expressed an intersection of antiquity and progressiveness, of home and places unknown and of Western and Eastern music. Shankar’s compositions and their use of both traditional Indian instruments and innovative musical techniques represented the complexity of the artist herself while also creating varied musical narratives. Anoushka Shankar’s<em> Land of Gold </em>was a dynamic melding of style, culture and intricate talent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70177\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70177\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/","id":6748,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6747,6746,6745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"María del Pilar Shares Truth in Song at MCC","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C525&ssl=1","description":"“Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor.” The words rolled off smoothly as del Pilar strummed the strings of her ukulele.

Throughout del Pilar’s performance it was clear that embracing who she is a motto that she lives by.</p>\n<p>Just about every seat in the building was taken and the crowd was filled with a variety of people. It was a fusion of cultures; the conversations that went on in the venue were in several different languages. People were anxious and a few minutes had already passed by after the scheduled start time. Despite the slight delay, the performer did not waste any time in delivering her eclectic sounds. Immediately after taking the stage, del Pilar took control and made the building a place full of energy. Her first song was intense. The way she sang was so passionate that it caught the crowd off guard.</p>\n<p>“<em>Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor</em> (You and I dance vigorously).” the intimate words rolled off of her tongue smoothly as she strummed the strings of her ukulele. The passion from her high-pitched vocals resonated throughout the room. Del Pilar’s fluorescent vocals were also accompanied by some amazing electric guitar accompaniment. The guitarist’s solos were intricate and very well done. The riffs vibrated throughout the room and created a powerful and alternative aesthetic. All the sounds going on meshed together perfectly and created a pretty and melodic vibe within the small venue.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After just about each one of the songs she performed, del Pilar shared some insight about her life with the crowd. She spoke about the bicultural influence that has inspired her to bring about this English and Spanish blend.</p>\n<p>“I started off with a band called ‘Los Abandoned,’” del Pilar shared. “We started somewhat of a Spanglish scene in Los Angeles. I just thought I should share with you all some of my back story since you may be wondering why I am dressed the way I am.”</p>\n<p>Del Pilar, embracing her roots, danced on stage wearing high-waisted pants and a large flower around her neck. Her energy rubbed off on the audience, and people were either standing and dancing — which del Pilar highly encouraged — or bobbing their heads and tapping their feet. It was evident that the artist has a rebellious soul and that all she wants is to have fun doing what she loves most: sharing her art with others and empowering those who face similar circumstances as hers. She spoke about the obstacles that her father had to overcome in order to provide her with a good life. Her father’s will to strive is what fueled her ambitions to be not only a musical artist but also a role model to others.</p>\n<p>“I am still going to do my thing despite anything that comes my way,” del Pilar exclaimed as she began her final song of the night.</p>\n<p>The singer finished off her setlist with her song “Quien Eres.”</p>\n<p>“This song is about not being afraid of who you are,” she stated. It was [[a]] night of Chilean alternative pop with a hint of young angst. Once the event was over just about everyone in attendance stood in line and waited to pick up a copy of del Pilar’s album <em>Songs+Canciones I</em>. I made sure not to leave without grabbing one for myself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/","id":6749,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6748,6747,6746],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
