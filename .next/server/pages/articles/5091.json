Hawaii went 2-2 on the weekend and is now 8-4 on the year and LMU won three of its four games to improve to 8-4 as well.</p>\n<p>Coming into their first game of the weekend, the Gauchos had their recent 14-4 loss at home to the Bears fresh in their minds. However, once again, they were unable to come away with a victory.</p>\n<p>Cal got out to a quick start, shutting out the Gauchos for the entire first half until freshman attacker Brenna Thomas put UCSB on the board at the second-quarter buzzer. The Bears put in three goals in each of the first two quarters, heading into the half with a 6-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>The third period was the Gaucho’s best offensively in the game, with sophomore utility Samantha Murphy scoring to open the half. Unable to stop the prolific Cal offense, though, UCSB conceded three goals for the third-straight quarter.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Carly Christian came up with UCSB’s lone goal in the fourth quarter and the Gauchos fell with a final score of 10-4.</p>\n<p>In the next game against UC Davis, Santa Barbara came out ready to play. Murphy scored an early goal to give UCSB an early lead, followed by a goal from sophomore utility Jessie Porter to give the Gauchos a 2-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Aggies answered back with a goal of their own, but Thomas put away her second buzzer beater of the day to give her team a 3-1 lead heading into the second period.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Megan Linder and Porter each scored a goal of their own in the second, but Davis scored three before halftime to make it 5-4.</p>\n<p>In the second half, it was the Jessie Porter show. The sophomore put away a penalty to open the scoring for her team in the second half before scoring four more goals, answering every push the Aggies made.</p>\n<p>With just a narrow 10-9 lead, freshman attacker Jenna Solberg scored to make it 11-9 and seal a UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>Porter led the way with a season-high seven goals. Sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw finished the game with four saves.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road this weekend when they play in the Cal Lutheran Invite. Their first game will be played on Friday at a time to be announced later in the week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54169\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-go-1-3-at-uci-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54169\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-go-1-3-at-uci-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-go-1-3-at-uci-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-go-1-3-at-uci-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-go-1-3-at-uci-invite/","id":5091,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5090,5089,5088],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Season Series Versus CSUF, Split with UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-1 win over Cal State Fullerton on Friday ended the UCSB women's volleyball team's five-match losing slump.

UCSB loss in straight sets by scores of 15-25, 23-25, and 21-25.</p>\n<p>The victory over the Titans ended UCSB’s five-match losing streak heading into the weekend, but Saturday’s outcome added another loss to the Gauchos’ records of 7-18 overall and 3-11 in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton continues to plummet after Friday’s loss and being swept by Cal Poly on Saturday. The Titans sit at 0-26 overall, 0-14 in conference matches, matching their second worst start in program history.</p>\n<p>However, it was a historic ending to the weekend for the Highlanders as they broke a program record for conference wins, earning their fifth in the sweep of UCSB. The 3-0 victory was the team’s second sweep of the season, creating another UCR record.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s quick start to open the match against CSUF led to it maintaining the lead throughout the entirety of the first set. An early 4-0 scoring run handed the Gauchos an 8-3 lead but would be trimmed as the Titans answered back with a 4-1 run of their own to pull within two at 7-9.</p>\n<p>Having the best season in her collegiate career, Grunt’s surge of three consecutive kills helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 13-7. Her 13 kills matched a season-high in attacks to go along with a .346 hitting clip. Grunt was the only Gaucho to record a solo block.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the first set with a .368 hitting percentage, holding Fullerton to a .135 clip for the 25-15 victory and 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Fullerton slowed down UCSB’s attack to a .286 hitting percentage in the second set and took an early 5-2 lead. But the Titans’ short stint of scores did not last long as they could not surpass the Gauchos’ defensive prowess.</p>\n<p>In addition to CSUF’s six errors, Santa Barbara allowed just seven kills to hold the Titans to a .028 hitting percentage. The Gauchos’ 76 digs were their second-most in a match this season. Leading UCSB in defensive scoops was freshman libero Emilia Petrachi with a match-high 26.</p>\n<p>Exchanges of scoring runs between the two teams resulted in Fullerton taking a 13-10 lead, ensuing a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the timeout was a reinvigorated Santa Barbara team as it achieved a 4-0 scoring rally of its own to force a CSUF timeout. But the Gauchos’ dominance persisted, extending into an 11-1 run that put them up 21-14 and eventually led to a 25-19 set victory.</p>\n<p>Five of Grunt’s 13 kills appeared during the set while UCSB notched four of its nine service aces as well, the total being its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>CSUF countered with an outstanding .448 hitting percentage in the third set. Most notably, Fullerton never trailed as it had 13 kills and zero errors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Katelyn Nielsen provided the spark to the Titans’ 16-5 run, tallying an individual 5-1 scoring run. She finished with a career-high 13 kills and helped lead Fullerton to its 25-14 win to cut the Gauchos’ lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>But Nielsen’s breakout performance was not enough to prevent UCSB from taking a 25-17 win in the final set for the 3-1 victory. UCSB’s .371 hitting percentage to end the match was its highest for the evening. Another four aces would appear as Sheffield had a match-high three.</p>\n<p>While neither team hit over a .300 clip in any set of Saturday’s match, UC Riverside’s offense was just enough to edge UCSB, specifically in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Villanueva registered another double digit hitting performance with 12 kills but was outperformed by the excellent attack of UCR’s senior outside hitter Helena Peric. She recorded a match-high 18 kills for the fourth time this season to lead Riverside to its 3-0 sweep of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face Hawai’i next Saturday, Nov. 14<sup>th</sup> in its last home match of the season. It will also be the team’s senior night in which five players will be honored.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-15/ucsb-sweeps-season-series-versus-csuf-split-with-ucr/","id":5088,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5087,5086,5085],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Searching for Upset of No. 8 Hawai’i on Senior Night, Will Face UCI to Close Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCI-20151107-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos close out their season with a pair of matches this weekend including their home season finale against Hawaii.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the first time in program history, the UCSB women’s volleyball team will finish a season without double-figure wins.

Just to play as hard as we can and have fun.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will end its season on the road, facing UC Irvine next Tuesday. After being swept by Hawaii, the Anteaters are 12-14 overall, 6-8 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began its conference schedule against Hawaii which resulted in a 3-0 sweep of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With its sweep of UC Irvine on Tuesday, the Rainbow Wahine clinched the Big West Conference title outright. Hawaii is currently the only Big West team with an undefeated conference record at 13-0 and is 23-1 overall.</p>\n<p>Its third conference title in the past four years, Hawaii earned its eighth Big West and 24th overall conference title. Since its 3-1 loss to No. 11 UCLA on Sept. 6, Hawaii has been the epitome of a championship caliber team. The Rainbow Wahine currently possess a 18-match winning streak, their longest since winning 19 straight in 2012.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s success this season is no coincidence as it has been one of the best defensive teams in the country. The Rainbow Wahine led the nation in blocks per set with a 3.37 average. Continuously stifling offenses, Hawaii’s .143 opponent hitting percentage ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>With statistical rankings atop the nation, it’s no coincidence that Hawaii has dominated nearly every statistical category within the Big West.</p>\n<p>Conference leads in hitting percentage (.287), blocks (3.37), kills per set (14.05), service aces per set (1.52) and opponent hitting percentage (.143). A total of three Hawaii players rank within the top five statistical leaders in hitting percentage, blocks per set and services aces per set.</p>\n<p>While no team revolves around one individual, junior opposite Nikki Taylor has been the Rainbow Wahine’s best player.</p>\n<p>The fourth player in Hawaii history to earn four Big West Player of the Week honors, the reigning conference Offensive Player of the Week has registered at least 20 kills in three of the team’s last four matches. Her averages of 4.36 kills per set and 0.44 service aces per set lead the conference while she ranks third in blocks per set with a 1.24 average.</p>\n<p>Although the odds do not favor UCSB, the combination of playing on its home court and motivation from the occasion give the Gauchos a chance to compete versus the Big West’s best.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be aggressive,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’re going to have a big size disadvantage against Hawaii but we still have to find a way to use that to our advantage. Making sure that we get our hands on the block and that there’s no tentativeness in our play.”</p>\n<p>Helping establish UCSB’s aggressiveness is freshman libero Emilia Petrachi. Due to UCSB’s lack of size, the Gauchos’ front row defense may not earn many blocks, leaving many dig opportunities for Petrachi. She recently earned her second Big West Freshman of the Week award after 20-plus back-to-back dig performances last weekend.</p>\n<p>Another chance to avenge a loss in the first meeting presents itself in the Gauchos’ rematch against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite Santa Barbara tying the match 1-1 after two sets, the Anteaters managed to earn a 3-1 victory. Close finishes in the final two sets, back-to-back 25-23 set victories, allowed UCI to edge UCSB for the win.</p>\n<p>“The Irvine match was very recent,” Lantagne Welch said. “We had three two-point sets with them. All we needed was a point here and a point there, and that match is a different story.”</p>\n<p>It was expected that freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha, the team’s leader in kills (318), would be the leading force in Irvine’s attack against the Gauchos. However, redshirt senior outside hitter Marisa Bubica carried the Anteaters to victory with a match-high 19 kills and finished with a .341 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Wins to end the season would be an encouraging finish for a team that has struggled to meet its expectations. But as the collegiate careers of five seniors come to an end, the journey of the players is most rewarding.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big deal,” Lantagne Welch said. “Seniors grow and progress throughout their careers. It’s a special moment, seeing them come along not only as volleyball players but people.”</p>\n<p>The Senior Night matchup versus Hawaii will begin at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 21 in the Thunderdome. UCSB’s last match of the season on Tuesday, Nov. 24 at UC Irvine will start at 7:00 p.m. and will be played at Crawford Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara got off to a disappointing start after opening its season 2-5 at home in the UCSB Winter Invite, but has maintained a high national ranking due to the extremely tough opponents it has faced. With a young squad composed of many freshmen and sophomores, the Gauchos have had few chances to play together thus far, but they continue to grow with every game.</p>\n<p>“The first tournament helped us to kind of see where we’re at and we figured out a lot of things we need to work on,” sophomore utility Samantha Murphy said. “In the San Diego tournament it was really good to work on a lot of new things offensively and defensively. I think we improved a lot and we’re looking to improve more this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The next opponent for the Gauchos is Cal, a team that it faced just three weekends ago at home and was defeated, 14-4. In that game, UCSB fell behind early and never had much of a chance to catch up, already trailing 8-1 by halftime.</p>\n<p>“Cal is a really strong team. All of their players are really strong, and they capitalize on any of our little mistakes,” Murphy said. “When we play them again it’ll be a much different game. We watched film and we went over our mistakes and we’re really going to capitalize on the improvements we made on defense and offense in the last tournament. Even though they’re a top-ranked team, we’re looking to surprise them.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Bears offensively this season has been driver Dora Antal. The impressive freshman has marked an outstanding 46 goals in 12 games. To put this number in perspective, her team has given up a total of 69 goals this season, and the player with the second most goals on the team, freshman driver Anna Illes, has just 19.</p>\n<p>“Every single one of them can shoot the lights out of the ball,” Hudson said. “At San Diego we really all clicked and started to mesh and gel together so I think it’ll definitely be a different game this time, just because of the fact that we’re learning how to communicate and play defense together.”</p>\n<p>One of the main problems for the Gauchos has been their offense. In their seven losses, they scored an average of six goals per game, compared to nine goals per game in their four wins.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we need to be more confident shooting,” Murphy said. “I think just the fact that we’re a little bit younger than we were last year makes us a little more hesitant to shoot, and we don’t have as many upperclassmen as we did last year, so we just need more confidence in our shooting.”</p>\n<p>Depending on whether they win or lose their first game, the Gauchos will likely play No. 17 UC Davis this weekend as well. The Aggies, who just barely edged UCSB by a score of 6-5 in San Diego, possess an 8-7 record and have already upset two teams higher than them in the rankings.</p>\n<p>“[It] is going to be a big game for us,” Murphy said. “We’re looking forward to playing them again and getting a win out of it because we play them in the Big West, too. It’s a team we know we can beat, we just need to work on our shooting.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play California at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday in the Anteater Aquatics Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-heads-to-uci-invite-this-weekend/","id":5090,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5089,5088,5087],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
