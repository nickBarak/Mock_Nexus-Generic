CSD manager. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The tenant-landlord mediation services will foster better relationships between tenants and landlords in I.V. and work out resolutions for disputes, according to Jonathan Abboud, I.V. CSD general manager.</p>\n<p>The program will cost approximately $33,000 which covers the launch date through the end of December 2018, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>Funding for this program will come from the $200,000 grant awarded to the I.V. CSD from UC Santa Barbara each year. The cost of the project includes payment of the mediator, bilingual assistant, project management, office supplies and insurance.</p>\n<p>The program will operate in the I.V. Community Room on Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Fridays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. During these hours, landlords or tenants can set mediation appointments through an online form found on the I.V. CSD’s website.</p>\n<p>Once a form is submitted, Abboud will contact both parties to schedule an appointment. Mediation is voluntary for both parties, so the scheduling of an appointment would be contingent on the motivation of each party to resolve their conflict.</p>\n<p>During the appointment, a mediator will discuss tenancy issues and help both parties work toward a resolution. The mediator will introduce the rules and conditions of the mediation and act as a neutral party between the landlord and tenant.</p>\n<p>Any discussion during the session is confidential, according to Sayre Macneil, mediator for the CSD.</p>\n<p>After the session, users will complete an evaluation form that the CSD will use to monitor the helpfulness of the program.</p>\n<p>Community members can drop in for counsel on tenancy issues if they cannot schedule an appointment, according to Abboud.</p>\n<p>The program is available for all community members in I.V. This service will not be available for students living in UC Santa Barbara housing, including the Santa Catalina Residence Hall, San Joaquin Villages, Santa Ynez, San Clemente Villages and Storke Family Housing.</p>\n<p>The CSD held a forum Monday to introduce the program and its mediator to the public. Macneil spoke about his experience in mediation and his preference for mediation over court action in resolving conflict.</p>\n<p>Macneil says mediation is a more humane avenue of settling disputes as opposed to using the court system, which can often be time consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>Macneil has been a practicing attorney since 1984 and received a certificate in Mediation and Dispute Resolution at the UC Santa Barbara Extension program.</p>\n<p>He said he has worked on several mediation cases involving landlord and tenant relationships and has identified systemic problems throughout these relationships that repeat themselves in individual cases, such as loss of security deposit, maintenance needs and communication issues.</p>\n<p>He said that solving disputes is often a matter of providing a space for people to express and acknowledge grievances as well as to hear the other party in a non-threatening way.</p>\n<p>“When they can understand that the other side has some legitimacy to their point of view, a resolution is 20 minutes away,” Macneil said.</p>\n<p>The program also includes a bilingual translator to assist mediation with Spanish speaking residents.</p>\n<p>Undocumented families living within I.V. might have more challenges in resolving tenancy issues and enforcing their rights due to their vulnerability as undocumented immigrants/citizens, Macneil said.</p>\n<p>“There are things that make these circumstances such that people need some education in the process about what their rights are,” Macneil said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>At an Isla Vista Community Services District (IVCSD) meeting on Tuesday, Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, presented the changes to the CSD, the first time the MTD has presented to the I.V. governance board.</p>\n<p>Before the creation of the CSD, the MTD held community meetings in various locations in Isla Vista, Goleta and Santa Barbara to propose service changes.</p>\n<p>Line 15x, the SBCC/UCSB Express, runs between SBCC, UCSB and Isla Vista. The suggested changes would improve time performance, simplify the bus route and create more access to SBCC.</p>\n<p>The line will no longer switch directions midday which has previously caused confusion and delay, according to Blackerby. Bus service on Friday between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m. will also be eliminated as there are very few classes at that time.</p>\n<p>Lines 7, 10 and 27 will see “minor” changes that would overall improve time performance, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The changes on line 27, the Isla Vista Shuttle, include adding more time to each trip in order to decrease the delays. This would result in the loss of four to five one-way trips per weekday.</p>\n<p>“It takes a while to get through I.V. in a bus because of all the congestion on the street and obviously to get through safely we need to go slow […] When you do something like that [adding time to each trip] it’s not very noticeable,” Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>The MTD will also temporarily discontinue line 21x, Carpinteria Express, until the Highway 101 HOV lanes are opened.</p>\n<p>Every April, the MTD informs the communities they serve of the upcoming changes to the bus services, which are then officially put into effect in August of that same year.</p>\n<p>A year ago, the MTD p<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/\">roposed new fareboxes</a> that would allow UCSB students to tap their ID cards on the farebox instead of showing a sticker that is given out every quarter.</p>\n<p>This new technology has been implemented in a few buses and, according to Blackery, the MTD is “getting close” to fully integrating the new fareboxes.</p>\n<p>IVCSD Board Secretary Spencer Brandt brought up the possibility of creating or modifying a bus line that would allow students to access Calle Real/Fairview marketplaces, which includes stores like Trader Joe’s.</p>\n<p>According to Google Maps, students can take either the 11 or 24x bus lines toward Goleta and walk 20 to 30 minutes to get to the Calle Real Shopping Center, or take either of those buses and transfer to the number 7, Goleta Old Town, line and walk a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Since its start in August 2016, Line 28 has been a “rousing success” to the point where the MTD will eventually require more support from UCSB, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said that both of these issues are being discussed at MTD.</p>\n<p>Blackerby also said that because line 28 buses often get filled to capacity at the El Colegio and Camino Corto stop across Santa Catalina, people looking to get on at different stops along El Colegio are sometimes “out of luck.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print

November incident captured on video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Gelb persistently called Bertrand a “fag” and made lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told Gelb he was unkind to his residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, the president of the I.V. Community Services District, is openly gay. His friend recorded the video, which was shared widely on the internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">District Attorney Joyce Dudley </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/isla-vista-landlord-charged-with-criminal-complaint-after-yelling-homophobic-slurs-at-csd-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indicted Gelb on a misdemeanor charge of “disturbing the peace”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November. His arraignment was then <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/\">delayed five times</a> over a four-month span until Gelb’s representation pleaded not guilty on Thursday. Gelb was not present in court for the arraignment and has not appeared at any previous hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griselda Carreon, associate attorney for Lynn &amp; O’Brien, LLP, argued in court to have the case dismissed, citing reasons that included Gelb’s right to free speech and the notion that the specific offensive language in question had not been specified by the prosecution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prosecutor Carl Barnes noted that other crimes, like battery, do not specify the precise nature of the harm committed. He pointed to the online video as a clear representation of the words used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superior Court Judge Raimundo Montes De Oca pointed out a line in the California penal code, which states, “offensive words in a public place which are inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction” can be designated as a crime against public peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carreon argued the language was not likely to provoke violence, referring to Bertrand having told police that he had sought to de-escalate the situation and was a person who believed in nonviolence. She also said the video was “unauthenticated” and “may have been clipped.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said Bertrand and “his buddy” had “laughed, smirked and continued to taunt Mr. Gelb.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca denied the demurrer, a request to dismiss the lawsuit, on the basis that the police report offered clear discovery of the crime Gelb was being accused of, as well as a shortage in facts that are necessary to compel a case dismissal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montes De Oca set a pre-trial conference date for June 4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unfortunate to see the various excuses for horrible behavior that have come up during this process,” Bertrand told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response to the notion that he had “taunted” Gelb. “But I continue to believe that people must be held accountable for their actions against the LGBTQ community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand, who has attended every hearing since Gelb’s first arraignment date, praised the “many community leaders” who have made statements in support of the LGBTQ+ community in the aftermath of the incident.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gelb’s attorneys from Lynn &amp; O’Brien have not responded to requests for comment. Barnes also declined to comment after the arraignment.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Bertrand used the word “unfortunate,” not “unfair.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div
