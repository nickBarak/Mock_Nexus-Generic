Now as a gay man, it should not surprise you that just the idea of eating out a girl used to make me shudder, and that’s coming from someone who eats out ass for pleasure. There’s just something about the vagina that makes many straight men a little nervous. They expect head as if it were a necessary precursor to sex, but girls don’t expect oral in the same way because getting it depends on whether or not guys are willing to give it. As such, I’m here to give everyone some advice on going down and eating out so that everyone understands that both guys and girls should be getting theirs when it comes to oral sex.</p>\n<p>First of all, one problem I’ve noticed a lot of girls talk to me about, is the fact that many guys aren’t naturally inclined to go down on them. When foreplay is going on, a guy might grab a girl’s head and push it down to his crotch to signify that he wants dome, but a girl doing the same is often considered lewd or taboo. If this is a problem in your sex life, you need to tell your man that you want to be eaten out, and if he’s not willing to reciprocate, start to think about whether or not he really cares about your needs — girls who want oral sex should be getting oral sex.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I’ve also talked to many girls who are afraid to be eaten out. In the same way I was nervous about having my ass licked by sexual partners for a long time, girls can be uncomfortable about guys going down on their vaginas — nervous about how it looks, tastes, etc. Now I’m not saying that every girl needs to be eaten out, but I will say that a lot of this self-conscious fear stems from the fact that guys don’t give head as often as they get dome, and as a result, girls aren’t accustomed to how guys will react to their pussies head on. Still, what I’ve learned over time is that being eaten out more often helps alleviate this self-conscious fear and makes you realize that your entire body — face, curves, labias, clitoris … everything — will be sexy and beautiful to the people having sex with you if they really do feel a sexual connection with you.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Once the preparatory fear of cunnilingus is overcome, some of the other problems couples have regarding oral is that not all guys know how to do it. I have lots of girlfriends who will admit that they’re not very good at head and want to get better, but interestingly, every single one of my straight friends will argue that he “gives the best head his girl has ever had” or “always makes his girl come when he eats her out.” My response — that’s bullshit. Guys need to realize that they’re not born with some innate, superhuman ability to force orgasms out of girls with their tongues, and that many of the orgasms they think they’ve given are really just pleas to end shitty head — fake orgasms. ‘Sup guys, want to change that? Then listen up, because there’s always room for improvement in sex, and the first thing you need to realize about oral is that it’s not that hard to give. Nonetheless, you need to be prepared to hone your skills with some or all of the following tips:</p>\n<p>1. Make sure she’s wet. If her vagina is dry when you start to eat her out, the experience will be dry as well, so finger her a bit to build up moisture in the area and make sure to part her lips before digging in so different parts of the vagina are exposed for maximum pleasure.</p>\n<p>2. When you begin to eat a girl out, don’t pretend that your tongue is a penis and stick it in and out of the vagina like a hummingbird digging for nectar. You want to spend most of your time licking up and down the clitoris, a hotspot of pleasure in girls at the junction of the labia minora (inner lips) of the vagina. Clitoral orgasms are actually the most intense a girl can have — yes, stronger than G-spot orgasms — so if you want a girl to scream in real pleasure and not fake boredom, focus most of your oral attention here.</p>\n<p>3. Just as you expect girls to use their hands during blow jobs, use yours when going down. Pinch her nipples, rub her midsection and stop giving head every couple of seconds to kiss other parts of her body while fingering her clit — these changeups will excite her sexually and leave her guessing as to what you’re going to do next.</p>\n<p>4. If you’re really inexperienced when it comes to servicing the vag, write your name or spell out the alphabet on hers with your tongue. This might sound strange, but it’s an easy way to create pleasure if you don’t have much skill going down on a girl. In doing this, you will very quickly learn what tongue movement patterns your girl responds to best, and can better respond to her specific oral needs.</p>\n<p>5. They might call it blow, but occasional sucking on the labia (lips) of a girl can actually create lots of pleasure for her … do this, and she’ll be sure to come in no time.</p>\n<p>6. Apply pressure with your tongue. Lots of guys think that eating out a girl involves just licking her vagina, but in reality, applying pressure with your tongue creates very pleasurable sensations for her that will result in a very intense orgasm that she probably won’t see coming. Even if you’re just eating her out for foreplay, this pressure can build up sexual tension that can help ensure her orgasm when you’re actually having sex — something that many men fail to give.</p>\n<p>7. Watch her face. You’ll know what your girl does and doesn’t like based on the faces that she makes when you eat her out. In watching her body language, listen for her moans and watch for moments of displeasure, because in doing that you’ll quickly learn how to best eat out your girl in a subtle way that doesn’t involve you having to literally ask her.</p>\n<p>8. I don’t think I’ve ever written an article that didn’t involve this next tip, so as I always advise, communicate with your partner. While I did just say that watching her body language is a nice way to be less awkward about finding out what she likes, building a healthy sexual relationship with someone also involves proper communication to ensure that both parties are comfortable and happy during all sexual acts.</p>\n<p>In closing, there you have it: my guide to oral sex. From here on out, never again believe that it sucks to suck, or be afraid to take a trip down to the cabbage patch. Great oral means great foreplay, and great foreplay means bigger orgasms and better sex. Guys, don’t be afraid to go down on your girlfriends, fuck buddies or even one night stands, because girls who receive good head are much more likely to give it in the future. As my straight roommate often says, dive into that pussy like the deep end of a swimming pool and make waves. Big. Fucking. Waves.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is very, very happy to be gay.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

We without a doubt have more liberated, realistic, and open views on sexuality and love than the generations preceding us. This, like pretty much anything else, has its positives and negatives. For one, it helps to keep us more motivated to be independent and secure on our own. Two, it’s opened the floodgates for important conversation about sex and other topics that need to be discussed. And three, it allows for us to truly explore ourselves on a deeper level, before deciding to make a real commitment. Playing the field and discovering what you really desire out of life is great, but it’s not always as easy as it sounds.</p>\n<p>No matter how hard we try to “keep it casual” we’re still human beings with human emotions. Spending intimate time with someone WILL lead to some sort of intimate feeling. Disclosing information about yourself to others, and having others do the same to you, is an experience that WILL emotionally bond you. And no matter how hard we try to fight it, sex WILL make things more complicated.</p>\n<p>While our generation may be less naïve about certain aspects of relationships, we’re arrogantly ignorant when it comes to accepting the reality of our emotions. We constantly play with fire, blindly thinking that if the flame catches, we won’t be the one who gets burned. I mean, is there anything wrong with fuck buddies, FWB’s, or one-night-stands? In my opinion, no, not as long as you can handle what comes with the territory. Unfortunately, many of us can’t, but try to pretend like we can.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>In fact, anyone who actually thinks that they are above the simple human emotion of attachment is in for a rude awakening.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, doing the casual thing is not by any means impossible. Lots of people can do it, and they can love it, and they can be really good at it. But, everyone has his or her limitations. Everyone has the capacity to feel and to fall. In my opinion, accepting this reality is actually the first step to successfully being able to date casually. It’s important to know that you’re not invincible when going into any sort of sexual or romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>For some reason, our generation seems to have a tough time swallowing this pill. We equate having emotions with being co-dependent and weak. We would rather be called heartless than called clingy. We like sex, but pretend that we don’t like the person we have sex with.</p>\n<p>These are all bullshit ideologies that our generation unsuccessfully tries to follow. While we tend to think that these assist in some sort of self-preservation, they are frankly just unrealistic, selfish, and immature. I don’t know who we think we’re fooling. In fact, anyone who actually thinks that they are above the simple human emotion of attachment is in for a rude awakening. If you don’t believe me, keep reading, because I was just like you not too long ago.</p>\n<p>My journey of sex and relationships took off with a rocky start. I went through various phases of being extremely naïve, to being extremely ignorant about my own feelings. I went from thinking I was supposed to have sex with one person my whole life, to quickly trying to discount sex as being nothing more than a physical act.</p>\n<p>After acquiring a bit more life and sexual experience, I thought that I had a pretty solid perspective on the whole thing. I thought that sex could mean more than just sex, but only if I was going to let it. I thought, that I could have complete control over my feelings, and whom they were for. So, this summer, I had a goal. My goal was to have as much fun as possible, with no strings attached during my last summer as a college student.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I became overwhelmed and spread too thin. Things changed, feelings were hurt, and like always, I learned something new.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A guy that I had hoped for a second chance with was going to be gone until September, so it was the perfect opportunity for me to be carefree and uninhibited. Then, after a summer full of frivolous fun, maybe I would have my chance at something more real.</p>\n<p>About two weeks into July, I met a new someone. Someone who was supposed to be moving far away in a couple of months. Someone who wasn’t in any position to be starting any sort of relationship. It was perfect. We got to know each other, had a lot of fun, and before I even realized what was happening, this person became my best friend. I had never been treated with such respect, care, or intensity. Things began to move fast and suddenly I was completely invested. As the weeks continued, feelings evolved, plans changed, things became more serious, and then it was September.</p>\n<p>I ended up getting what I had hoped for. A second chance with someone that I wasn’t sure would give me one. The only problem was that my “casual summer fling” wasn’t so casual anymore. At first I thought I could handle it. I thought I could juggle all of the emotions and confusion that I was experiencing. I thought that I could do the casual thing, with two people who I already had invested feelings in, until I absolutely needed to make a decision.</p>\n<p>As I enjoyed the attention and confidence of having two guys wanting to be around, I felt invincible. I thought that for sure, I wasn’t going to be in any position to get hurt. I actually thought that I was in a great position to be in. I had options. Two guys who I really liked, two guys who I enjoyed spending time with.</p>\n<p>The disappointing reality of my attempt at casual dating hit me after a couple of weeks of trying to juggle my various emotions. It couldn’t be done. I became overwhelmed and spread too thin. Things changed, feelings were hurt, and like always, I learned something new. I learned that casual dating is possible, but only if you actually keep things casual.</p>\n<p>I learned that no matter how much you tell yourself that you won’t fall, sometimes you do. I learned that toying with serious feelings and promises leads to hurt. And I learned that no matter how hard you try to control things, they just don’t always fall into place the way you think they will.</p>\n<p>While this experience was not what I thought it would be, it gave me the tools that I needed to figure how I can do casual dating the right way for me. Everyone is different; everyone has different expectations and different needs. As for me, I now know what my limitations are. I now know that I can in fact do the casual thing, but only with one person at a time. I now know that when casually dating, I can allow myself to fall a little bit, knowing that I very well might get hurt in the end. And I now know how I want to be treated and how I want to treat others, even when dating casually.</p>\n<p>So, if you think casual dating might be right for you, try it. Just remember: you’re not an emotionless robot that is impervious to feelings (no matter how hard you try), always be honest with yourself about what it is that you truly want, regardless of how you feel it will make you look to others, and most importantly, remember that casual dating is above all else, supposed to be fun. So go out there, and enjoy it.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos encourages you to have fun without forgetting that feelings are real. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Women out there who read any kind of fashion magazine — and the men they sleep with — may be the first ones aware of changing trends, but as time goes on, word spreads, and we all become aware of developing trends for your down-there hair.</p>\n<p>The waves of change are puzzling in many cases, and one has to wonder if your choice of vulvar topiary really matters (probably not). However, things like merkins pubic wigs worn by actors as an attempt at modesty, or vajazzling, the motivations for which are mystifying unto themselves, are examples of the bizarre options the freedoms we have as Americans bring us.</p>\n<p>On shaving and waxing: The options for landscaping vary immensely, but if you’re doing any kind of management for your lady or man fur, the go-to options are shaving and waxing. We all know the potential issues with shaving — and the longer you do it, the more likely you are to have nasty side effects. It does seem that the general population at UCSB leans toward waxing, if only because you have to book B Boutique appointments two weeks in advance. The idea of spreading your legs for a stranger without a guaranteed orgasm is uncomfortable enough, but the pain of having hair ripped out of your body is much worse. The good news is the more you go, the less you grow, basically, and your hair follicles actually get smaller over time, which means less bush and more bonsai tree.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>These trends can be hard to follow even if you’re trying, and to be honest, who has the time? When you finally do get your “situation” in order, you realize that everything really can be politicized, including your personal grooming habits. Once you start shaving or waxing, that interim growing-out period turns into a time where you’re nervous about what whoever you sleep with will say. You have hair now: will they be okay with it? Your intention may be to get rid of it, but having it in the meantime turns into a source of insecurity because you may not know what their preferences are. Not everyone is lucky enough to run into the guy who thinks “half a centimeter is ideal,” because, due to porn (ah, the good and the evil of it!), most guys forget that we, too, are capable of growing hair in many places — even if we don’t necessarily want it there.</p>\n<p>This is a time when some women are dyeing their armpit hair neon colors, and hair’s relevance to our culture is emerging as various issues such as cultural appropriation and feminism intertwine; this is no less true for your curlies. I’m sure we’ve all heard of or met the woman who says the preferences of men will not dictate what she does with her body, and the man who says he doesn’t like it when women resemble a prepubescent girl rather than a mature vixen.</p>\n<p>We tell ourselves that we make grooming decisions based on what we want for our own bodies. It’s true that most women get dressed for themselves, or for other women if anything, and we claim that we make our grooming decisions for the most part because of personal preference. Hair that’s visible to everybody is more subject to influence by social milieus, but if you really ask yourself, I’m sure it’s a mixture of personal preference and what you’re worried someone will say. When you hear that everyone is shaving, trimming or pulling it off with wax strips, the insecurity can abound. If other people are used to it, you don’t want to be talked about after your hookup as “that gross girl who didn’t shave.” Not to mention guys don’t go down enough as it is — you may be afraid to give your guy another excuse not to.</p>\n<p>At its root, this is a feminist topic — Not the feminism that people misunderstand as man-hating raucous ideology, but the real feminism that advocates for equality between sexes and genders. You should be able to make any grooming decision you want, whether you decide you want to braid, wax, dye or stick jewels on your area — it’s up to you. The societal issue lies in the fact that you may become insecure when you’re waiting for hair to grow out between waxes because of what whoever sees you naked will say. Real equality would be being able to tell your boyfriend that you want him to wax into a landing strip and having him actually consider it because he knows it makes you happy, but outside of a relationship — where things like that may be up for discussion — you shouldn’t have to worry about what somebody else thinks. So take a deep breath, figure out what you want and go for it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/sex-and-the-university-to-have-hair-or-not-to-have-hair-down-there/","id":6309,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6308,6307,6306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sex Bloopers: A Collection of Anonymous Misfortunes","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/legday.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/legday.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A collection of anonymously submitted sex bloopers from around the UCSB campus.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I’m riding him reverse cowgirl style, and I suddenly hear a little “plop-plup” sound of air popping out from a hole. Turns out my man farted, and the scent of his deadly sin wafts up into the air and sears my nostrils. God. I can tell you that right then and there, my pussy went from a wet oasis to a dried out desert.</p>\n<p>The lights are off, the ambience steamy and sensual. We’re makin’ love missionary, and he’s in a generous mood so he says, “Let me eat you out, baby. Come on, let me do it.” He pulls out and starts to finger me, huskily continuing to offer his oral services. To accentuate his point, he takes his finger out and teases, “I can taste you like this by licking my finger, but I’d rather use my tongue to play with your clit.” I egg him on, so he sticks his finger in his mouth and does one taste — suddenly his face contorts and he looks like he’s about to gag. Yea, what can I say? A period hits when a period hits.</p>\n<p>One time, I was over at my then-boyfriend’s hometown dwelling. We thought nobody was going to be home for at least two hours, so we started going at it with enthusiasm. However, we did not hear the door knob jiggle, and lo and behold, his parents caught us tangled up naked in the sheets.

Just shitloads of queefing.</p>\n<p>During my senior year of high school, I ran into this guy at church, after not seeing him since middle school. We started texting regularly and I was really attracted his “badass” hair and snakebites, for reasons I do not know. I ended up going to his house after school one day to hook up. I wasn’t down to have sex, so he put in “Avatar” and I gave him a blow job. His mom got home after that and he didn’t want to risk getting caught, so he seriously made me climb out of his bedroom window (which was on the second floor). After getting out of the window and climbing on to the ledge above the garage, I discovered how high up I actually was, and being only five feet tall, I definitely freaked out a little. I do not know how I actually succeeded getting back on the ground, but I scratched up my hands pretty badly on the way and never talked to him again. I have not been able to watch “Avatar” since.</p>\n<p>This guy I had a fling with freshman and sophomore year came by one night. I had a twin-sized bunk bed that was dangerously close to the ceiling and even more dangerously squeaky — not an ideal hook-up spot in a house with thin walls and a lot of housemates. Next to the lofted squeak was my desk chair, a little wooden seat that I had studied in since my preteen years. Despite its nearly antique build, we decided to get bare on my chair. He sat down facing me, and I eased down on top of him to sit facing him. The second we started thrusting, however, one of the legs on the chair popped out from under us and we went toppling over, hitting the ground hard and laughing even harder. We ended up just going at it on the floor and he even screwed the chair leg back into its nook after he finished screwing a different nook. The chair is still standing to this day, but it hasn’t seen any action since that night.</p>\n<p>I felt pretty bad about sexiling this guy’s roommate … until I woke up the next morning to him … in his bed across the room … staring directly into my eyes. Unsettling, to say the least.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I thought it would be romantic to take a bath together. We had the bubbles, candles and steamy water drawn and the mood was set. We stripped down and he slipped into the tub first. I slinked over and put my feet on either side of his reclined body, facing toward him and away from the shower head and bath faucet. As I tried to sexily dip down on top of him and was nearly in a squat position, I saw a smirk cross his face and felt a cold, sharp pang in my butt, sending me leaping up in cries and screams. The bath faucet knob had oh-so-perfectly aligned itself to nearly pop my anal virginity, and my boyfriend — who didn’t warn me in the seconds before it happened — thought it was hilarious. Needless to say, he bathed alone that night.</p>\n<p>My life is a sex blooper…</p>\n<p>I had been hooking up with this girl, and we went around back at this party so we could have a bit of fun. She started giving me a handjob and, suffice to say, the pain was excruciating. So bad, in fact that I had to break things off with her later that night… I don’t really feel all that bad about it, though, because now she’s a model and significantly more attractive than me.</p>\n<p>A couple months ago, while engaging in vigorous coitus with my femme fatale, I was struck with the sudden, insatiable desire to finger m’girl’s pooper. Being the suave gentleman that I am I couldn’t just shove it in of course, so I set about caressing the back of her thigh with my index finger and going in for the kill several moments before she climaxed. Upon entering her I was immediately greeted with the stench and texture of human shit. Unsuprising, if you take a moment to think about it. But what happened next was almost indescribable. Instead of plugging the proverbial leak in the dyke (no pun intended), my anal expedition managed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back and from her poured a massive, massive shit that covered my whole arm. Screaming wildly, I disentangled myself from her and the mountain of feces and ran into the bathroom to flush my arm in the toilet while my femme fatale just sat there screaming. Now every time I have the sex (we have since separated), I get the smallest whiff of flatulence and the fucking is such stanky sorrow.</p>\n<p>The day after I broke up with my ex, we met up for “closure” a.k.a. break-up sex. Distracted by the situation at hand, I ignored my phone for several hours. My nosy best friend, worried about my emotional state post-breakup, went looking for me everywhere — including my ex’s apartment. She walked in on us mid-act. Busted. Always make sure you lock the doors before you have secret sex with an ex.</p>\n<p>The last girl I was with thought that I was really into having my earlobes sucked, so one night she gave me the “special treatment” and went at it for well over 20 minutes. It started to hurt after about the first five, but she just kept right on going, sucking harder and harder. I just didn’t have the heart to tell her that my earlobes were about one suck away from exploding. The next day they swelled up to about double their original size and, after a couple of days, they started peeling because they had been so inflated.</p>\n<p>I woke up one morning after a friend’s party to this girl who I had hooked up with a couple times grinding on me. She had a boyfriend and we had extensively discussed that we could not hook up anymore so long as she was taken, but she felt that grinding her vag on me was A-Ok, as long as she didn’t kiss me. I pretended to be asleep throughout pretty much the whole thing, so I basically laid there with a boner (I’m only human) pretending to be unresponsive for at least 15 minutes while she just went at it. I still don’t know if she thought I was actually asleep or just so overcome with bliss that I couldn’t even open my eyes.</p>\n<p>I was in a photobooth with some girl at a party and we started to get into it when another girl came up and opened the curtain. Apparently the girl I was with had a problem with this other girl, because she immediately punched her out and casually sat back down. I have never been more terrified to hook up with anybody, but what choice did I have? The girl had a mean right hook…</p>\n<p><em>This is a collection of anonymous stories.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 16, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
