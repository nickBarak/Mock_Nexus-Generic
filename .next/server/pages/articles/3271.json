David Ige gave the project’s construction a green light, leading </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/20/hawaii-mauna-kea-thirty-meter-telescope\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local residents to block access to the construction site. </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest is ongoing and has resulted in </span><a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/07/17/breaking-news/thirty-meter-telescope-protesters-brace-for-arrests-at-mauna-kea/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dozens of arrests.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it was only in the last week, following national attention surrounding the protests, that UCSB students discovered Yang is the chair of TMT’s board of governors, a position he has held since 2007, and that the UC </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledged $300 million to build the telescope</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Sv9fA0QsPFuu-HgZeHaV7BzFYoHYPhmR1sKUz5CmoaY/edit?fbclid=IwAR0AMFF85XTJ1d2A0p5xH9NBzhCbjSLNcm5gvwtG6GMVYT0B1mboKUi3nNA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One open letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> circulating the UCSB community, created by fourth-year theater and anthropology double major Ivana Cruz, calls for Yang’s resignation from the chair of the board of governors, a formal apology to those “affected by the construction of the TMT” and a statement in support of Mauna Kea’s preservation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Sunday night, Cruz said the open letter has over 120 responses from students at schools around the world: UCLA, Stanford, Boston City College and the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter states that “[TMT] is based on the fundamental belief that projects conducted by institutions should come before the willing consent of the people whose land is to be governed, even when these institutions have no connection to the land.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not back down from these demands nor will we accept any opportunities for dialogue that present the issue as one where all players have an equal voice and which can be solved by anything but the official and permanent discontinuation of the project,” the open letter read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cruz declined to comment further, stating she did not want to speak on behalf of Native Hawaiians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter also asks signers to list the location and time of any public appearances Yang may be making in the near future that they know of, so event organizers “can be contacted and pressured into canceling his appearances until he adheres to the demands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ciara Thrower, a third-year environmental studies and political science double major, started another </span><a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/The_students_of_the_University_of_California_Stop_Chancellor_Yang_and_UC_involvement_in_building_the_TMT_on_Mauna_Kea/?oMOXKob&amp;utm_source=sharetools&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=petition-760812-Stop_Chancellor_Yang_and_UC_involvement_in_building_the_TMT_on_Mauna_Kea&amp;utm_term=MOXKob%2Ben\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Thursday asking Yang and the UC to withdraw involvement from the construction of the telescope.

She added that native lands should be prioritized above the scientific project, despite the advantages that might come with putting the telescope at Mauna Kea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do realize that the volcano is supposedly the best place for astronomy, but I think the native homeland is more important than [being] the best place they could build it. They could build it at the second best place,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang did not provide comment regarding opposition to his involvement with TMT but said in a previous email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “Hawai‘i is a special place that has long pioneered and honored the art and science of astronomy and navigation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We acknowledge those who disagree with our project and express our respect for their views,” he stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than a week after petitions and open letters began circulating, protesters at UC Berkeley organized a two-hour demonstration on July 22 that included students, local elders and representatives from indigenous rights groups, </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2019/07/22/protesters-at-uc-berkeley-demand-uc-divestment-from-telescope-construction-on-mauna-kea/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Daily Californian reported</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC spokesperson Claire Doan said the UC “welcomes” the feedback it has received on the TMT project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We appreciate the input of the individuals and groups who have helped shape the evolution of TMT, and will continue working to ensure that this project – in its efforts to advance science and astronomy – will honor and respect the cultures and traditions of Hawaii,” she said in an email.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: [7/23]: A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled the name of a student who created a petition.

Food Security Committee, said the Free SB campaign set its sights specifically on the cultivation tax because of its “reliability”; due to the recency of legalized marijuana, Moon said, the tax is unlikely to go anywhere for some time, which the campaign flagged as a good marker for consistent funds.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cultivation tax first arrived in California in January 2018, when the state deemed that “harvested cannabis is subject to a cultivation tax … [and] applies to all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/l519.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA.)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax, according to the CDTFA, is set at $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of marijuana flower and $2.75 per dry-weight of marijuana leaves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is also a popular product among local growers — over “a third of all cultivation licenses issued in California to date are held in Santa Barbara County,” according to a </span><a href=\"https://sd19.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-06-24-jackson-issues-statement-cannabis-trailer-bill-vote\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the </span><a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/local/santa-barbara-county-cannabis-tax-revenues-yet-to-materialize/article_13df5cb0-6165-506a-aee4-6787a650a187.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Maria Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Barbara County could earn between $4 and $64 million in tax revenue per year. According to quarterly reports from the CDTFA, however, the entire state yielded only $35 million in cultivation tax revenue in 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Steel said the state is using the cultivation tax for administrative purposes, namely to “hire people to process the applications for [marijuana] growers and to make sure that legal growers are abiding [by] codes and to shut down illegal growing operations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to change where the money goes, Steel said, is to start locally. Aside from engaging with UCSB student leaders about the tax, Steel said he is also focused on “trying to get our student body aware of the situation.” He hopes to rally enough student support so that local lawmakers will consider amending the tax to grant the campaign access to the revenue stream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara County Board of] supervisors are revisiting [how the cultivation tax can be used]. If we’re able to show large community support behind it, I think we will bring the issue to the forefront of the supervisors’ attention,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel also acknowledged that UCSB students are not unique to facing financial insecurities. He described the situation as a “county issue,” noting that students at several other universities in the area — such as Hancock College and Santa Barbara City College — face similar economic hardships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Moon said he could help support the initiative by “writ[ing] up a resolution in support of this campaign” within the A.S. Senate next year and by reaching out to various campus organizations to further bolster the campaign.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, both Moon and Steel said the campaign’s foremost goal is to garner support at the July 9 Board of Supervisors meeting in Santa Maria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really trying to build from the ground up a coalition of grassroots movements. We’re [aiming] to make those who could affect change, like the board supervisors, aware of the needs and concerns of the tens of thousands of students in the county,” Moon said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

However, the amendment failed 11-9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP is currently working with legislative staff on AB 1620, which would expand eligibility for non-AB 540 undocumented students, according to Alcocer.

When I first came to UCSB, I didn’t really like it here, and being in the residential community was something that really changed that for me,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Voss said she recognized the importance of RHA’s primary focus on event planning and management, she felt that the association could further expand its supply of resources for residents by providing more professional and academic opportunities in the dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have safe, alternative events that people can go to. But I also think that’s not what makes living in the dorms better. I think what makes living in the dorms better is having different kinds of facilities, opportunities and resources that you don’t get off campus,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these insights in mind, Voss ran for RHA president against incumbent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kyle Bates</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in spring  2018 and won.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came into the position this year not necessarily knowing what I was getting myself into. I knew that I loved RHA’s mission, and I loved the fact that we get to do work that’s so personal and intimate,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Voss’s biggest goals this past year was working on the expansion of professional and academic resources for residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is currently implementing a series of workshops focused on event planning and management. The workshops would teach students the basics of event planning, from making room reservations to funding requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her presidency, Voss prioritized building connections with offices such as Residential and Community Living (RNCL) and Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE). She said that she noticed a disconnect between these entities and residents and took it upon herself to become an intermediary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not that these offices don’t care about these issues, it’s that they don’t know about them. Their offices are separate from students, and they don’t really employ students in their offices,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss explained that higher entities are often uninformed about everyday residential issues such as laundry malfunctions. She feels that by maintaining stronger channels of communication between these offices and RHA, these problems can be solved more efficiently and effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m someone who’s not really afraid to stand up and advocate for students, and I’m not someone who’s going to say I’m going to do something and then not do it. For me that has to do with going into a conversation with these offices with a really clear plan of exactly what I’d like to do,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is also committed to seeking creative, alternative sources for funding when entities like RNCL are not equipped to fund certain programs. This includes applying for grants from the Zero Waste Committee and seeking funds from other organizations on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we do have great sources of funding as RHA, I’m definitely willing to look to other resources if we can’t fulfill the kinds of things that I think are important to students through those resources,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As RHA president, Voss attended </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PACURH (Pacific Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls) housing conferences at UCLA and Southern Oregon University in November</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fifty schools from the Pacific Region, which includes California, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington and Oregon, were invited to the conference.. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss said the money for conferences came entirely from fundraising and not student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss also created “Resources with RHA,” a program that distributes hundreds of free midterm materials in the residence halls every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She  is also working with several members of RHA to create a new position in Hall Councils next year: an International Student Engagement Chair. The position will work closely with the Office of International Student Services (OISS) to ensure adequate resources and opportunities for international students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After completing her first year as RHA president, Voss decided to run again in an effort to accomplish her longer-term goals and projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constant changes in leadership affect the productivity of student government each year, Voss said. This problem is especially pertinent for RHA, she added, since living in the residence halls is a requirement of being in the organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every single year RHA is completely different than the previous year, and very few of the projects are long-lasting,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss took 63% of the vote in this year’s RHA elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I can take a lot of things I’ve done this year and make it even better for next year in a way that leaves a stronger foundation for the next RHA,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited for the fact that in RHA we really have the agency to accomplish a lot of wonderful things, and that I feel like I have such a stronger idea of how RHA works and how to actually get projects off the ground,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Editor’s Note]: Laila Voss is a copy editor for the</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Daily Nexus</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

It is really administrative things, and making sure everyone has the right information,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis plans to further refine and streamline the avenues through which students can communicate and become involved with RHA during her tenure as Administrative Vice President.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like a lot of residents don’t know what RHA is, and they kind of have a vague knowledge of their hall councils and don’t know if there’s anything above that. So I definitely want to make sure that residents not only know what we do, but [that] they know they can submit events and ideas and that they don’t have to go through Hall Council,” Davis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis hopes to make information more accessible to students. A common issue she saw working in Hall Council and as a desk attendant in San Nicolas Hall this year were the discrepancies between stated and actual office hours.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m a desk attendant in San Nic and the biggest RHA office is in San Nic. So many times this year people have come up to me looking for the office to be open and it’s not, because somebody hasn’t done their office hours,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we tell residents we’re going to be there, we should be there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond her specific role, Davis said she is excited to work with president-elect Voss, particularly because of Voss’s focus on student activism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A big program [Voss] wants to do is non-debitizing the laundry machines.

Come to this social or this event,’ and you’ll go but you’re not really immersed. You go, you sit there, you might get a snack, you listen in, somebody asks for your name, but then they walk away and you’re kind of, like, left there. You don’t connect,” Schaefer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As co-president, Schaefer said she was drawn to the position of Programming Vice President because she felt it was unique among the other executive positions in regard to the interactivity with regular students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the Manzanita presidency opened up, I thought that by being president I could do more, and you can, but you don’t really have opportunities to throw events. When I saw that Programming Vice President was opening next year, I realized that that’s what I really want to do,” Schaefer said.</span></p>\n<p><b>Angela Friedman: National Communications Coordinator</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Angela Friedman, first-year film and media studies major, was elected to the position of National Communication Coordinator for the 2019-2020 school year.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88416\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/angela-friedman-rha/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88416\" data-attachment-id=\"88416\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-21/rha-elections-a-look-at-the-2019-2020-executives/angela-friedman-rha/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Angela-Friedman-–-RHA.png?fit=554%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"554,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Angela Friedman – RHA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Angela-Friedman-–-RHA.png?fit=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Angela-Friedman-–-RHA.png?fit=554%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-88416\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Angela-Friedman-%E2%80%93-RHA.png?resize=268%2C310\" alt=\"\" width=\"268\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Angela-Friedman-–-RHA.png?w=554&amp;ssl=1 554w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Angela-Friedman-–-RHA.png?resize=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88416\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of RHA website</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friedman was appointed to Programming Vice President during Spring Quarter 2019 after the resignation of Austin Rowe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She intended to solely run for re-election but decided to concurrently run for National Communication Coordinator (NCC) at the suggestion of Matt Hartt, the current NCC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more I thought about it the more I thought I could learn from this position.
