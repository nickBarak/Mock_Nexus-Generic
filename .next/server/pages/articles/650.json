Facing such adversity, the UCSB men’s basketball team will have a chance to make a statement and end a three-game losing skid tonight when they face Hawaii on the road.</p>\n<p>With possibly only eight players eligible to play due to injury, the third youngest team in the nation has struggled in rebounding from injuries to several critical players. UCSB enters tonight’s matchup with an 8-18 overall record and 4-10 mark in conference, while Hawaii is 16-11 on the season and 9-6 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Injuries are] definitely tough in general for any team, but especially for us,” freshman forward Taran Brown said. “We’re such a young team and we haven’t had a lot of chances to handle that kind of adversity. We’ve just got to come together in times like this and push it the rest of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB previously dropped a 51-50 decision to Sacramento State in the BracketBusters game and must now return to conference play against the third place Warriors. Santa Barbara sits in eighth place in the conference standings, a mere half game ahead of Cal State Northridge for the final slot in the postseason tournament.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, meanwhile, is coming off an 84-50 victory over Northern Arizona that snapped a two-game skid. The last time these two teams met in Santa Barbara, junior forward Christian Standhardinger went off for career-highs with 31 points and 16 rebounds in a 78-73 Hawaii victory.</p>\n<p>“We definitely can’t let him get off,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve got to do a better job on all their guys inside. We got our rear ends handed to us inside on the glass and we have to fight harder, block out better, and be more physical in keeping them off the glass.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will potentially be without one of its top scorers in junior guard Kyle Boswell, who is sitting out with an injured shoulder. Sophomore center Alan Williams, the team’s leading scorer, rebounder and shot blocker has also only played in two games since returning from a sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have to see how we come out and play and practice,” Coach Williams said. “It was actually kind of impressive after a nine hour travel day they came out and practiced really well. Practice was good, they were feisty, they were competitive; things we want to see.”</p>\n<p>Practice may have been a little too feisty though, as Brown cracked his nose during Tuesday’s practice in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I’m definitely in some pain right now,” Brown said. “I’m going to have to wear a mask tomorrow in the game, but I can’t let it hold me back, I’ve got to keep going. At this point we don’t think I broke my nose.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara struggles to rebound from a slow season and tries to clinch a spot in the postseason tournament, maybe a trip to Hawaii is exactly what the Gauchos needed to get them back on track.</p>\n<p>“I like the idea of coming out to Hawaii, getting a smile on our faces and just getting some positive energy,” Brown said. “I think that’s a big thing we need right now with this type of season.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50404\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50404\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/","id":650,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[649,648,647],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Johnson Making Impact with Indiana","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"At this time last season, Orlando Johnson was the best player for the UCSB men’s basketball team and a hopeful candidate for the NBA draft.

While playing time was slow for Johnson in the beginning of the season, he improved his game by playing for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA D-League.</p>\n<p>Soon after he received a shot at playing time, Johnson earned a spot in the rotation thanks to his excellent three-point shooting. Johnson currently leads the Pacers from behind the arc, shooting .500 on the season, a team high.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very good three-point shooter, but he also was swarmed all the time, double-teamed and guarded and he was the focus every game we went into,” Williams said. “Now he’s getting to play on a team that has all-stars on it and a lot of other really good players and he’s a role player that gets to come in. He’s always had great range on his shot.”</p>\n<p>Johnson left UCSB as the school’s all-time leading scorer in just three seasons of play, so it comes as no surprise to Gauchos to see Johnson score. He emerged in Indiana’s rotation in large part to an injury to Danny Granger, eclipsing veterans Gerald Green and Sam Young for time.</p>\n<p>The fact that he is also contributing on a team that is in playoff contention only makes Johnson’s emergence in the NBA that much more impressive. Indiana currently holds a 38-22 record, second best in the Eastern Conference behind only defending champion Miami.</p>\n<p>During the month of February, Johnson averaged 4.6 points and 2.2 rebounds per game while shooting .531 from behind the arc. On Feb. 22, he registered a career-high 14 points and 23 minutes of playing time in a 114-82 victory over the Pistons. Johnson was a perfect 5-5 from the field, including 3-3 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“Nobody will work harder at their game; nobody will work harder at the trade than Orlando,” Williams said. “He’s not physically going to get a lot better; he’s a big strong man already. Where he’s going to get a lot better is the concepts of the NBA game, how they play it. If that happens, he’s going to get a lot more valuable. I think he’ll always be a role player in the NBA. That’s really valuable and that’s really good if you can be an NBA role player.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50517\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50517\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/","id":647,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[646,645,644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Max Heidegger Sets Career High in UCSB’s Season Opener vs NDSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-13-at-10.11.18-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-13-at-10.11.18-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Excitement filled the T-Dome as Head Coach Joe Pasternack and the Gauchos took on North Dakota State.

To start off, senior forward Leland King II (23 points, 9 rebounds) and senior guard Gabe Vincent (7 points, 8 assists) provided a steady veteran presence for the somewhat jittery Gauchos, scoring or assisting the first nine points of the game.</p>\n<p>It was a heartwarming sight for the Gaucho faithful to see Vincent knock down the first three of the game, and for him to set his career high in assists in his first real game back from last year’s season ending knee injury.</p>\n<p>For NDSU, much of the offensive load was put on senior Paul Miller from the jump. The guard managed to muster up 18 points, five rebounds, and six assists but was hounded by the UCSB defense the entire game and was not really able to get in his comfort zone at any point.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, leading UCSB was Heidegger, who established his presence in the first half with 17 points, making all of his four field goals from beyond the arc while going 5-5 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>At one point, following four straight points by King II, Heidegger knocked down back-to-back three pointers to put UCSB up by ten with two minutes to go.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t too worried about my shot, even when I missed my first three,” Heidegger said. “Because I had to fill in for Marcus [Jackson], I was just trying to get the offense going and let the scoring come to me”.</p>\n<p>He ended with eight three pointers in the game, tied for second most in program history and one shy of the record nine three pointers that former Gaucho Michael Bryson made against Seattle in 2015.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went into halftime up by nine, 40-31, which was mostly the result of a stifling switch heavy defense which forced the Bison into tough shots and passes the whole half.</p>\n<p>For the second half, UCSB remained consistent, as both Heidegger and King II continued to call their own numbers and drained shot after shot giving the Gauchos a 15 point lead five minutes in.</p>\n<p>A major factor for this second half run that both Coach Pasternack and Gabe Vincent pointed out postgame was “winning the rebound war”. In the second half, the Bison only got one offensive rebound, completely cutting out any second chance opportunities.</p>\n<p>The fight and energy that senior forward Jalen Canty brought down to the block definitely had something to do with that.</p>\n<p>The Oakland native did an outstanding job of leveraging his strength against the often taller forwards of NDSU. He was a factor both offensively and defensively, scoring 13 points on 4-8 shooting along with three “And-1” continuation calls, and on the defensive end he had the second most rebounds on the team (four defensive and three offensive).</p>\n<p>Later in the second half, Canty’s ability to score and draw fouls in the post was key to stopping a Bison run which cut the lead to nine at 70-61 following two made free-throws by the Bisons’ Miller.</p>\n<p>Overall, the season opener went down perfectly. Hot shooting from Heidegger and King II kept the game exciting for the crowd, while the gritty Gaucho defense secured the win. The UCSB community is desperate for a great team to rally around, and if this team continues to keep up the defensive intensity, commit to ball movement, fight for every rebound and most importantly “honor the process” as Pasternack would say, then the outlook for UCSB’s season could be promising.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Gauchos got off to a horrible start, turning the ball over six times in their first nine possessions. As a result, the Titans took an early 9-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled offensively, failing to score until there were just under 12 minutes left in the first half, and as a result entered halftime down 23-16. The 16-point half was the Gauchos’ worst start to a game this season.</p>\n<p>To open the second half, Santa Barbara finally began to climb back into the game. Two free throws from junior guard Nicole Nesbit brought the score within three at 27-24, but the Titans responded with a 7-0 run to extend their lead back to 10 points. However, Santa Barbara continued to fight, closing the gap to four points with four minutes to go.</p>\n<p>While Fullerton left the door open for UCSB, the Gauchos were unable to take advantage of their many opportunities to win the game. After coming within four, the Titans turned the ball over. However, Santa Barbara returned the favor. The Titans then missed on the front end of a one-and-one opportunity, but UCSB gave the ball back to Fullerton once again with an offensive foul.</p>\n<p>Unable to make a shot that would bring the Gauchos within one possession, Fullerton eventually took advantage. Down the stretch, the Titans went seven for eight from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Despite outshooting the Titans 32.6 percent to 24.4 percent, UCSB sent Fullerton to the free throw line 25 times. The Titans converted their opportunities, shooting 84.0 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Nesbit was the only player for the Gauchos with more than six points, tallying a game-high. For Fullerton, sophomore guard Chante Miles and junior guard Alex Thomas paced the team tallying 11 points each.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to forget about tonight’s loss as it travels to UC Riverside Saturday. At 11-15 overall and 4-11 in the Big West, the Highlanders have lost five straight; however the last time these two teams played, Riverside upset the Gauchos 45-42.</p>\n<p>UCSB turned the ball over 17 times leading to a 20-6 points off turnovers advantage for Riverside. Junior center Natasha Hadley dominated down low, scoring 20 points and giving the Highlanders a 20-6 advantage in the paint.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, their lead was just two with under a minute remaining. Nesbit drew a foul, but made just one of her free throws, exhibiting the Gaucho’s horrible night from the charity stripe as they shot 56.2 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>While Hadley gave the Gauchos fits in the last matchup, senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham has made her mark on the conference as the strongest offensive threat, leading the Big West in points per game with 18.2.</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50436\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50436\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/fullerton-upsets-ucsb-snaps-second-longest-winning-streak-in-nation/","id":649,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[648,647,646],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
