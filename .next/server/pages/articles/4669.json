We are trying to make a run here for the post season and a sweep definitely would have helped out our cause.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the two wins the Gauchos improve to 20-18 on the year and 6-6 in the Big West while Long Beach falls to 17-20 and is also 6-6 in the Big West to keep a tie in the middle of the standings.</p>\n<p>Friday’s game was a pitcher’s duel that saw the only scoring in the first inning. Junior second baseman Jeff McNeil doubled to lead off the game and two productive outs brought him in to score the only Long Beach run of the day.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ half of the first inning, sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward walked and junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon hit a two-run home run into right field for the only two runs UCSB would score.</p>\n<p>From that point on, both pitchers were in total control. Long Beach junior starting pitcher Shane Carle pitched six and a third innings, allowing just the two runs on seven hits. The bullpen went on to pitch an inning and two thirds of hitless relief work while striking out four.</p>\n<p>Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone showed why he is the Gauchos’ ace. Pettibone allowed only one run in the first and cruised through eight and a third innings, striking out five in the process to improve to 5-2 on the year. Freshman reliever Dylan Hecht came in to get the last two outs, both strikeouts, to collect his fourth save on the year.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara came away with another one-run victory in walk-off fashion. The two teams exchanged the lead in the second, third and fourth innings until Long Beach put up a three spot in the sixth to take the lead on a three-run home run.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came back with one run in the eighth to tie it up late before a walk-off single by sophomore centerfielder Cameron Newell ended it in the bottom of the ninth to a score of 5-4.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, reigning Big West Pitcher of the Week in freshman Robby Nesovic took the mound for the Gauchos to try and complete the sweep. Nesovic was roughed up for seven runs, six earned, through just two and a third innings.</p>\n<p>“We thought we had [this] since Nesovic went out last week and was really good — he threw the ball well at Fullerton but he wasn’t able to repeat his performance,” Checketts said. “We will have to go back to the drawing board and figure out why and see what we need to change in his routine to get him more dialed in. He just wasn’t dialed in today. He was elevated and struggled with his breaking ball.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could not get the offense going until the later innings when they put up two runs in both the sixth and the seventh innings.</p>\n<p>Nesovic helped his own cause when he homered in the sixth for the Gauchos first run.</p>\n<p>Trinkwon, who hit his second home run of the weekend, also drove in his fourth run of the weekend in the bottom of the seventh. Over the last four games, Trinkwon has really turned it on, as he is five for his last 15 with six RBI.</p>\n<p>“I’ve just been trying to stay more simple and short to try to help my team,” Trinkwon said. “I have got into a couple counts where I could actually swing it and wasn’t afraid to, and I helped the team out.”</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB will be a rematch with the University of San Diego this Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50972\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50972\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/gauchos-take-two-of-three-at-home-against-long-beach/","id":4669,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4668,4667,4666],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Drops Contest Against Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB baseball team fell to Pepperdine Tuesday afternoon with a score of 3-1.

The Warriors move to a record of 7-17 on the year and 2-1 in the Big West. The four game series began Thursday when the Gauchos captured the first game of the series and continued through Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were led by sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa in game one against the Warriors where his three hits and three RBI propelled Santa Barbara to victory. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone was touched up for four runs through five and two-thirds innings but left the game with the lead. Sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle relieved Pettibone to escape the sixth but allowed a run in the seventh after two singles and a wild pitch put a runner in scoring position to score on a groundout.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the top of the ninth inning the Gauchos sophomore right fielder Luke Swenson began a rally with a single to lead off the inning. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon then sacrificed Swenson to second base to put the go ahead run in scoring position with the heart of the order coming up. The Warriors picked their poison by intentionally walking the clean-up hitter in freshman designated hitter Robert Nesovic, who since March 9 is hitting .366. The walk brought up Kuresa who would then double in both runners on the first pitch to take a two-run lead in the top of the ninth and seal the victory in game one 7-6.</p>\n<p>Game two on Friday was dominated by the Warriors senior starting pitcher Corey MacDonald. The Gauchos jumped to an early two-run lead in the top of the second but MacDonald would only allow just two more hits the rest of the game and go on to pitch a complete game, striking out six for his third win of the year.</p>\n<p>Gauchos starting pitcher freshman Justin Jacome had matched MacDonald through six innings of work but could not get out of the seventh inning as he and the Santa Barbara relievers relinquished four runs and the lead, falling 6-2 on the day.</p>\n<p>On Saturday the Gauchos fell again in Hawaii 6-4. Santa Barbara again scored first on a RBI double by Nesovic but freshman starting pitcher Kenny Chapman allowed a run in each inning from the second to the fifth. Chapman was kept from the decision thanks to a three-run home run by sophomore third baseman Peter Maris in the top of the fourth.</p>\n<p>With the game tied into the bottom of the eighth inning, Mahle, who had relieved Chapman in the fifth, walked the leadoff hitter and allowed a single before a double into right field by junior right fielder Connor George gave the Warriors the lead for the final time.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos will be a one game showdown at home against Pepperdine on Tuesday, April 2 at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-01/ucsb-splits-series-against-hawaii/","id":4667,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4666,4665,4664],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Seeks Revenge Against San Diego","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2622.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2622.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"  The UCSB baseball team gets a chance at some revenge tonight against the University of San Diego.

The team has also gone 2-1 since the last meeting between these two teams as UCSB took a conference series win against Long Beach State over the weekend. USD has been even better, going 3-0 since Tuesday and improving to 24-15 and 9-6 in the West Coast Conference, moving into a four-way tie for second place.</p>\n<p>In last Tuesday’s game, the Gauchos put up thee runs to take the lead in the top of the third on a couple of doubles. The Toreros responded in the bottom of the third for two, though, to chip away at the lead on a Bryant two-run home run.</p>\n<p>They then scored four more runs in the fourth to take a lead that they would not relinquish thanks to an additional home run by Bryant in the seventh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t throw the ball in the strike zone when Kris Bryant is up,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said about one of the keys to the game. “We’ve got to get the guys out in front of him and don’t pitch to him. We learned the hard way [last week].”</p>\n<p>USD’s Bryant currently sits at 20 home runs on the year, tops among all players in the NCAA. Last week, Bryant was named the national player of the week as he went 7-14 with a double, five home runs and six RBI. He is not a feast-or-famine hitter either, as he is hitting .353 on the year and has struck out only 27 times in 136 at bats.</p>\n<p>Bryant’s .897 slugging percentage, also best in the NCAA, is grounds for teams to pitch around as he has walked 49 times, 30 more than any other San Diego player. The walks, along with his average, have led to his .530 on-base percentage, which ranks second in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Bryant’s numbers could be even more impressive if it were not for the fact he hits atop the Torero lineup. Bryant’s high OBP has led him to score 51 runs on the year and his five stolen bases are second on his team.</p>\n<p>The Toreros scorched the Santa Barbara pitching staff for three home runs last week, since the weekday games typically feature relief pitchers throwing just a few innings as health has been an issue for the Gauchos’ staff this season.</p>\n<p>“We need to figure out who we are going to throw,” Checketts said. “We are a little short-manned with some guys banged up right now. It will probably be a staff day [today].”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense has started to heat up in recent games. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon went deep twice over the weekend and has driven in six runs over his last four games. Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who homered in the last game against USD, and freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic, who homered Sunday, have also shown some power for the Gauchos as they look to get some revenge from last Tuesday‘s loss.</p>\n<p>“Clutch hitting — it’s all we need,” Trinkwon said. “We throw strikes really well and our defense is good when we do throw strikes, so it’s just clutch hitting. We have to get guys on base and execute. Its all we really need to focus on.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is slated to take place at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of April 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50999\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50999\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/ucsb-seeks-revenge-against-san-diego/","id":4668,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4667,4666,4665],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
