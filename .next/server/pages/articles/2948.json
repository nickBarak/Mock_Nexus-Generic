During their open forum Saifuddin and Oved explained the student regent application process and discussed the responsibilities that accompany the position in order to reach out to a more diverse pool of applicants for the 2016-17 Student Regent application. Issues facing UC students were also discussed, including mental health, food security and the recently approved tuition increase plan.</p>\n<p>Saifuddin said the main issue facing UC students today, which she has focused on extensively during her term as a regent, is food security. According to Saifuddin, she is looking to address issues of food inaccessibility for students on campuses in which food prices tend to be high.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a problem that students have to make a decision between books and food,” Saifuddin said. “Students should never have to skip a meal. I’m working on creating a system-wide food security model that still has the flexibility for each of the campuses to adapt for their own culture and their own needs, but has some kind of coordinated response so that students don’t go hungry.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik, who attended the forum to learn about how students can mobilize to support student regents, Saifuddin and Oved are using a different recruitment approach this year, meeting with students across the system in an open forum, as well as forums specifically for African American, Asian Pacific American, Chicano/Latino, American Indian/Native American, Middle Eastern and undocumented student minority groups.</p>\n<p>“They are looking for a very diverse group of applicants this year and that’s the exact reason why they’re doing this tour … to talk with students that are on the ground, students that perhaps have not understood what this position entails and to get them interested,” Abdalmalik said. “I think that they have done a very good job of doing so, especially when talking to students that are normally underrepresented such as Middle Eastern students, undocumented students.”</p>\n<p>During the forum, Saifuddin said her experience as the only member of the Board of Regents outside of ex-officio members to vote “no” on the proposed tuition increase was difficult but necessary.</p>\n<p>“You’re kinda backed up against the wall when you’re a student regent,” Saifuddin said. “Students don’t need another tuition increase. It really puts a crunch on middle class students and our campuses really have a big chunk of middle class students.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, students from an upper-income level family could likely handle an increase of $600, which is approximately what the tuition increase would be annually, but that it puts unnecessary pressure on middle-income students.</p>\n<p>“It seems kinda affordable, but for middle-class students that’s like one month of rent and that’s a lot of hours of work,” Saifuddin said. “Work-study jobs do not make that much. It’s very rare to find a work study job that makes over $15 an hour, and that’s on the high end. It was kind of personal for me because I had gone through a tuition increase and I had to work. I felt that craziness, and really depression.”</p>\n<p>Saifuddin also said she is concerned by what she perceives as continued divestment in the UC by the state over the last 10 to 20 years.</p>\n<p>“The state is slowly dwindling the funds and increasing the budget for things like the Rainy Day Fund that the governor put another like $1.2 billion dollars into in the recent budgets, or prisons, which are really big, actually one of the things at the top,” Saifuddin said. “But when you work with students so intimately you understand what their personal struggle is and I just can’t support that.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Oved is currently working on addressing safety on UC campuses, an issue he said he tackled while working in student government at UCLA and will continue to focus on when he becomes the official Student Regent in July of this year.</p>\n<p>“One thing that we did is develop a mobile panic button safety application,” Oved said. “It was an idea I got from the UC [blue light] phone booths, but those aren’t practical. What we wanted to do was heighten safety resources at UCLA and make it more relevant so students are more equipped with resources. So in the event of an emergency they would be able to respond.”</p>\n<p>According to Oved, the mobile safety application was created in partnership with Circle of 6, a free app that aims to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. The application, according to Oved, “centralizes” emergency communication efforts with six friends that become informed of a person’s location via GPS if they press a button indicating they need help.</p>\n<p>Oved said the application also centralizes safety information with campus resources like Community Service Organization (CSO) and Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE).</p>\n<p>“It’s these resources that I was told by multiple students, ‘I wish I had that, that night, when I really needed it,’ ” Oved said. “I think it’s a really valuable tool and really starts the conversation about safety awareness as well. It also falls under the umbrella of [the UC] President’s task force on responding to and protecting students from sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>According to Saifuddin, the Board of Regents is also discussing how to address student mental health issues and how to make counseling and other resources more available to students struggling with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“Right now students make appointments for mental health counselors or psychologists and what ends up happening is they have to wait four, or five or six weeks, and then it’s finals time and it’s like, ‘Okay well, good job, nothing happened, we weren’t able to help students,’ ” Saifuddin said. “Every year there is a suicide on campus, so it’s really, really critical that we deal with this problem.”</p>\n<p>Oved also said working one-on-one with UC President Janet Napolitano can be refreshing, because unlike some members of the Board of Regents she is very candid when communicating with Oved and Saifuddin.</p>\n<p>“When we have meeting with her she doesn’t sugar coat her answers,” Oved said. “She is very straight forward. ‘Yes I agree and we’ll support this’ or ‘No I don’t agree and this is why.’ ”</p>\n<p>According to Oved however, the Board’s straight-forward way of communicating can also be “frustrating.”</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes that’s also a really frustrating thing in the student regent position is that you want to do so well and to advocate and to make a dent in your term,” Oved said, “but oftentimes there are people within the democracy who don’t really necessarily want to jump on board with you.”</p>\n<p>Second year biopsychology major Niki Elyasi said she thought the student regents did a “fantastic job” during the forums and are commendable for reaching out to more students in order to allow for a more diverse student regent applicant pool.</p>\n<p>“Bringing people who haven’t been involved in student government, [like] undocumented students [and] Middle Eastern students — I think that is just really, really great,” Elyasi said. “I give them huge kudos for spearheading that and for taking so much time out of what they do to just to reach out to people and make them see that this is something that you can actually do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

newly named National Academy of Inventors (NAI) fellows as part of the 4th Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Materials professor and recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics Shuji Nakamura was named a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI) on Dec 16.</p>\n<p>Nakamura will be inducted into NAI on March 20, along with 170 other newly named NAI fellows, as part of the 4th Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where fellows will be awarded trophies, medals and rosette pins. The NAI is a non-profit organization with 414 fellows, collectively holding nearly 14,000 U.S. patents and representing over 150 institutions, and it serves to recognize inventors who hold U.S. Patents. Nominees must be named inventors on at least one patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and are chosen by their peers and then later approved by a selection committee.</p>\n<p>Nakamura said in an email that he credits the NAI honor to his invention of the energy efficient blue light emitting diode (LED) and blue laser diodes, for which he was recently also awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. Nakmura also said his inspiration for his work comes from a deep examination of the world around him.</p>\n<p>“I like to think about anything deeply to understand the mechanism behind the scene,” Nakamura said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI President, founder and AAAS-Lemelson Invention Ambassador Paul R. Sanberg said designation as a fellow is the only high-level national honor specifically available to academic inventors.</p>\n<p>“The NAI fellows are prolific innovators whose discoveries and inventions have fostered new ideas, products and companies that benefit their institutions and communities and are making an impact on society,” Sanberg said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI Vice President George Newkome, who himself holds 45 patents and has published 450 scientific papers, said Nakamura’s fellowship will lead the way for more faculty at the university to become NAI fellows in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that professor Nakamura was chosen to be a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors it is a true honor to be part of NAI and I am sure that many others from UCSB will be following in his footsteps,” Newkome said in an email.</p>\n<p>Two other faculty are also NAI fellows — Materials Professor and Co-Director of UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) Steven DenBaars and Chemical Engineering professor and Founding Director of the Center for Bioengineering Samir Mitragotri.</p>\n<p>According to DenBaars, Nakamura’s fellowship further reinforces his position as a world renown innovator and highlights the widely impactful effect he has made globally with his innvention of the LED.</p>\n<p>“As a colleague and co-director of SSLEEC I am delighted that Shuji Nakamura is a new NAI Fellow,” DenBaars said in an email. “This is a strong endorsement of Shuji inventions and patents he has filed since coming to UCSB 14 years ago. This is indicative of Shuji’s innovative research and world-leading status of UCSB’s materials department.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitragotri, Nakamura’s election to the NIA is a significant recognition of his accomplishments in physics and materials science.</p>\n<p>“In addition to celebrating innovation, NAI enables the fellow to collectively think about some of the important aspects of promoting and sustaining academic innovation,” Mitragotri said in an email. “Shuji has made some of the most significant inventions of our generation. His election to NAI recognizes his accomplishments.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/","id":2945,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2944,2943,2942],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Finance and Business Committee convened in the State St. room in the UCen on Monday. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met in the State Street Room in the UCen on Monday evening to listen to and grant funding requests to various student organizations.</p>\n<p>Three groups received full funding before the Board lost forum due to an inadequate number of members and continued in discussion over what they would decide to fund when the Board met again. Groups that received full funding included El Congreso, receiving $10,000 for their Raza College Rally, the Japanese Language Café receiving $250 and finally Chicano/Chicana Grads, which received $14,077 to hold an alternative graduation for Latino/Latina students. Cotillion Dance’s request for $150 for a non-dance social at the Student Resources Building was tabled after representatives for the club failed to show up to the meeting. The other groups will now wait to hear back from the Board and will receive responses to their funding requests when the A.S. Senate meets this Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Student comedy group Laughology requested $6,510 for their six upcoming shows after explaining that they had an impressive lineup including Dana Gould, a writer for the Simpsons, and Grammy Award winning comic Tig Notaro.</p>\n<p>“Winter quarter is historically slow for just about everything. It’s really hard to get people to come in — not true for us,” a spokesperson for the club said. “It seems like we are on a bit of a snowball effect here and we’ve got a really crazy order of comedians lined up. It is probably the best quarter we have ever booked.”</p>\n<p>The American Institute for Chemical Engineers (AIChE), a student association of chemical engineering students, asked for $842 for funding for an annual Southern California regional mixer that will be open to all students on campus at all year levels.</p>\n<p>The event will feature AIChE representatives from six universities and 80 chapters, according to AIChE Internal Vice President and third-year chemical engineering major Dilpreet Kaur.</p>\n<p>“Specifically right now, it is a very important for us to go because our current president is resigning due to personal issues and we have two other people stepping up in leadership,” Kaur said. “This conference will give a great opportunity for them to talk to other leaders and the other organizations and see how we can complete our events for this year and get advice on running our chapter.”</p>\n<p>The Lindy Circle, a Goleta-based dance organization, came to request $2,632 for a dancing event with a band they have every quarter. Representatives for the club said this year’s event will feature a premier swing dance act led by jazz guitarist Jonathan Stout.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Ensemble Troupe, a women’s student theatre organization on campus, requested $3,000 to put on the Vagina Monologues, an ensemble performance play featuring women’s personal perspectives on love, sex, rape, gender and other issues, held each Winter quarter. In addition, the Muslim Student Association requested an additional $284 for transportation to an upcoming MSA conference at UCLA. The Chinese Students and Scholars Association also requested to re-allocate $324, the Women’s Ensemble requested $3,000, literary arts magazine the Catalyst requested $4,759, Laughology requested $6510, the Lindy Circle requested $2,632 and the American Institute for Chemical Engineers requested $842.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59683\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59683\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/","id":2946,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2945,2944,2943],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Campus Remembers UCPD Officer","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Borrayo1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Borrayo1.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Police Department (UCPD) Sgt.

Tony Borrayo (Photo Courtesy of UCSB News)</p></div>\n<p>UCSB Police Department (UCPD) Sgt. Tony Borrayo died in the early hours of the morning while he was asleep at home with his family last Sunday on Jan. 4.</p>\n<p>A cause of death has not been determined. During his time with UCPD, Borrayo received numerous awards and accolades, including a Supervisory Certificate from the California Peace Officers Standardized Training and the prestigious H. Thomas Guerry Award, given to officers by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors for excellence in law enforcement.</p>\n<p>According to Borravo’s colleague and UCPD officer Sgt. Mark Signa, Borrayo was an “amazing member” of the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Borrayo has been a friend and part of the UC/IV community for almost 20 years,” Signa said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to a statement released by the Office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Borrayo is Santa Barbara born and raised, and graduated from Dos Pueblos High School in Santa Barbara before attending Santa Barbara City College. He began his career at UCSB in 1994, when he worked at the UCen and in the Parking and Transportation Services before eventually becoming a police officer with UCPD.</p>\n<p>According to Assistant Director of Student Programs Marilyn Dukes, Borrayo was a highly regarded member of UCPD and said his passing was unexpected.</p>\n<p>“[I] have worked with Tony at events for many years, so his passing came as quite a shock,” Dukes said. “Tony was very committed to his work and to the campus community and my sympathies go out to his family and the UCPD who are, no doubt, feeling his loss very deeply.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang’s statement, Borrayo represented both the department and the community at multiple events and ceremonies throughout the state. Borrayo also helped in the creation of the UCPD Honor Guard, and recently joined an advocacy group to aid undocumented students and Dream Scholars.</p>\n<p>A memorial service was held on Friday, Jan. 9 at St. Raphael Catholic Church in Goleta. UCPD officers wore memorial patches over their badges in his memory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/","id":2947,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[2946,2945,2944],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
