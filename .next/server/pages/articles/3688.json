He also had “a dirty white beard, [was] wearing mussed clothing or dirty in appearance.” He may be driving an older, four-door gray car that looks “similar to a Chevy Volt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first victim said her attacker “smelled heavily of alcohol”; the second said he smelled like marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Tuesday evening, he has not been apprehended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first assault occurred on Saturday afternoon around 12:30 p.m. along a creek near Phelps Road and Ocean Walk Lane, when the suspect grabbed a 22-year-old female jogger by the shoulder and arm “in an attempt to pull her closer to him,” according to an initial </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-10/timely-warning-issued-for-assault-on-campus-adjacent-property/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim punched at the suspect in an attempt to break free, but the suspect then “grabbed the victim by her shoulders and punched her in the face,” according to the initial timely warning. She was able to break free and run back to her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim sustained “redness and swelling” to her face during the assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second assault occurred Monday evening at approximately 10:30 p.m. An 18-year-old female was waiting for friends by her car in the Haskell’s Beach parking area in Goleta when she noticed a man sitting in a dark-colored vehicle nearby, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man then approached her, placed his hand on her back and asked her if she was OK. He then “reached under the front of her shirt and sexually assaulted her,” according to the release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim then “kicked at the suspect, striking him in the groin area.” She then ran to her friends for help, while the suspect fled to his vehicle and drove away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proximity of the attacks, similar suspect descriptions and similar locations, being “isolated areas near rural access,” led the Sheriff’s Office to believe the assaults were perpetrated by the same suspect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone with more information about the suspect can contact the department at (805) 681-4100 or submit an anonymous report </span><a href=\"http://www.sbsheriff.org/anonymoustips.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Levine, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-23/galoustian-files-motion-in-court-requesting-ucpd-internal-documents-alleging-violation-of-due-process-in-his-arrest-and-investigation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented a Pitchess motion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is used in instances when a defendant wants to request information from a police officer’s personnel file. The motion was originally filed with the court on Oct. 3, 2019. Levine’s motion resulted in the trial being pushed back to January 2020; it was initially scheduled to begin on Dec. 4, 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine was particularly interested in investigating Officer Ryan Hashimoto, who allegedly circulated a video “of an alleged sexual assault that was evidence in [Galoustian’s] case” and was an initial investigator in Galoustian’s case, which began in December 2017, when he was first arrested. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This incident was detailed in a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed against the UC Santa Barbara Police Department in March, in which Officer Ryan Smith, who is referred to as John Doe in court documents, alleged widespread racism, misconduct and conspiracy within the department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alison Bernal, an attorney for the Regents of the University of California, and Lieutenant Robert Romero of UCPD, appeared as representatives of the department at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. The two confirmed to Judge James Herman that an internal affairs investigation had just been opened against Hashimoto and that it would take approximately six months for it to conclude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman ruled against Levine’s motion, which named multiple officers — Hashimoto, Officers Michael Little and Tiffany Little and Lieutenant Mark Signa — who Bernal, Romero and Karapetian confirmed were not involved in the case, but still granted Levine the additional time to investigate Hashimoto independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman initially considered pushing the trial back a full six months to allow Levine access to the internal affairs findings, but Karapetian, who is also a senior deputy district attorney for Santa Barbara County, pressed the judge to consider the victims, who she said were “eager” and “anxious” to get the trial over with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would be in strong opposition to any continuance of this case,” Karapetian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine, who expressed frustration that he first learned about the civil suit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/09/whistleblower-lawsuits-blow-lid-off-ucsb-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> newspaper articles, argued that the defense needed time to conduct its own investigation, particularly since Levine was without the resources and results of the internal affairs investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawyers for the University of California Board of Regents, including Bernal, filed an opposing motion on Oct. 18, arguing that because many of the officers named in the motion were not involved in Galoustian’s investigation or arrest, Herman should exclude them from his decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Herman emphasized that the defendant had a right to “exculpatory” information — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evidence that clears the defendant from guilt in a criminal trial — which</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could arise from an investigation of Hashimoto. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine also said the defense would be interested in calling Hashimoto as a key witness for the trial, even as Karapetian stressed to the judge that the prosecution would not be calling him or using his statements because of the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, who is currently facing 33 felony charges on behalf of two victims, was brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair wearing a large brace on his right leg at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Levine, Galoustian has been “very ill” and received medical treatment. Levine did not comment further on Galoustian’s condition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trial is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 8, 2020 and is expected to take approximately 15 court days. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

But beyond the Associated Students (A.S.) Legal Code, the role requires “a great deal of listening” and a willingness for personal connection, according to Nguyen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), which is required to wait for students to reach out on their own accord before offering help, suffers from a lack of visibility imbued in the position, an element of his office that he has struggled to promote throughout the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“S.A.G. is very different from the other A.S. offices. It’s a little more removed from A.S. as an entity,” Nguyen said. “It’s really all for the students, and there’s nothing more rewarding than a student walking out of your office, and them knowing it isn’t the end of the world, and knowing what’s about to happen to them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen, an off-campus senator in the 2018-2019 school year and the sole contender for the position of S.A.G. when he ran in 2019, was criticized for his lack of relevant experience for the position. He had “zero experience” within the OSA while <a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/\">running for the position</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen acknowledged his lack of experience for the role, calling it something he “worked really, really hard to overcome.” He said he worked to educate himself on the ins and outs of the office through relationships with mentors from A.S. and the Isla Vista community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also acknowledged his own personal growth and the empathy that was required of him to properly carry out the duties of the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was scared, running for this position. I was so scared I was going to mess it up. But then, as I went through the job, I realized that the most important part of it was being really empathetic, and really present,” Nguyen explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike other A.S. positions, the work of the S.A.G. is inherently less transparent because it deals with confidential case files. While Nguyen couldn’t discuss specific cases, he said he definitely noticed “a trend in plagiarism cases” throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Usually, if students know they’re guilty, they’ll just bite the bullet, take the punishment,” Nguyen said. But for “students who truly thought they hadn’t plagiarized,” Nguyen and his team were able to take the issue to the faculty member and work out a solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While casework like this is an important part of the job, Nguyen credited Grecia Martinez, his predecessor, as helpful to some of his office’s other successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grecia was amazing,” he said. “She sat down with me, explained so many of her projects, and a lot of these we worked on during my term.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That included the digitization of case intake forms so future S.A.G.’s can access the database and look up how a particular case was handled in the past for reference, Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also took Martinez’s advice and decided to drop one of his main campaigning platforms, a school-wide poll to see what services students needed as a whole, which was first suggested by Jack Tannenbaum, the 2017-2018 S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I talked to Grecia about it, she thought, and I agreed, that the office, since it’s still so new, really needed to focus on outreach first, and not this student-body poll,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the poll didn’t work out for the OSA, Nguyen has hopes that other facets of A.S. will continue to work on a similar project to measure students’ needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That type of poll, to see what the student body needs, could be really helpful to any senators, to any office,” he said, adding that A.S. President Alison Sir’s office is working on a project like this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the interview, Nguyen said he hadn’t heard from his successor, the 2019-2020 S.A.G.-elect Melissa Perez, but suggested that going forward, she should look towards continuing promoting the visibility of the S.A.G. office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a tool a lot of students need. So it would be cool to see her doing stuff like that, to promote the office,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen agreed that in some ways, his term in office had failed to bring the necessary visibility to the community outside of A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I worked on bringing visibility within A.S. because the office is so new that even people in A.S. didn’t really know about it. I did that with the hopes that those people would spread it to their circles, and we would expand the office that way,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I recognize that for people in none of those circles, there is still a lack of visibility. So I hope Melissa can really focus on that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Nguyen did credit his time and work in the office for successfully building a “very strong, very tight-knit team.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone received all the training, everyone was at every briefing. Everyone, including myself, felt the weight of the job. We knew that a student’s future could be on the line if we weren’t doing our jobs properly,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen also noted that all of his team members who aren’t graduating plan on staying with the office, provided Perez rehires them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he entered the office, Nguyen said only one person from the previous year remained, so he “hired everyone new,” and “really wanted to hire people who were going to stay and love the job,” he said </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with the efforts of Nguyen’s team, working together during the coronavirus pandemic has been difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really just aren’t seeing the case number[s] that we were at school,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, court proceedings for academic misconduct cases have been changing due to the pandemic, according to Nguyen, who added that “everyone is trying to proceed business as usual, but doing so remotely, with things like altered deadlines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite the challenges he faced during his term, Nguyen said he is “eternally grateful” for his time as S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has changed me in ways I didn’t know were possible,” he said. “It was the most rewarding work I’ve ever done in my life. But it was also the hardest work.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on what he would change about the role, Nguyen looked back to the importance of compassion and empathy that he has learned over the past year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really wish that there would be more of an emphasis on empathy for this role. I know that’s something you couldn’t really put in legal code — it probably isn’t very legal — but just really, for the next person who does this job to know, it demands the most caring individual,” he said. “That’s so important to this job.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said the position of Student Advocate General was created in 2015.
