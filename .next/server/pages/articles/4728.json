The series of events aims to provide students and I.V. residents the opportunity to learn how AB 3 could benefit the community and to advocate for I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 to the State Assembly in December 2014 to establish a Community Services District (CSD) with the ability to levy taxes to provide residents with improved local services and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the events are meant to motivate and inform students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s educational, and it’s also in the hopes of empowering people to do work surrounding AB 3, be involved in the process, to really engage with both the bill and the concept of self-governance,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the key to successfully advocating for AB 3 is to educate I.V. residents by canvassing door to door.</p>\n<p>“I really think it’s just getting the word out,” Dela Cruz said. “There’s no way that we can just mail something out and hope that everyone knows about this. You literally have to go and knock on doors and talk to people. So it’s more talking to them and having them engage in the conversation that we’re having.”</p>\n<p>Williams said community engagement will be key to ensuring the events over the next two weeks are successful.</p>\n<p>“This is the time to show the Legislature that local support exists for AB 3, a bill which will create a community services district to meet the specific and unique needs of Isla Vista,” Williams said in an email. “Having backing from the County of Santa Barbara and surrounding cities is crucial to show the need for more direct government in this area.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 supporters being present at this week’s meetings and next week in Sacramento will be key to the bill’s success.</p>\n<p>“Bottom line is we need Isla Vista community members to rally together and be heard in the Legislature,” Williams said in an email. “Their presence is critical to ensure passing of this bill. Their voices need to be heard. They know the challenges first-hand and can serve as a strong force to move this bill successfully through the legislative process.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said AB 3 is unique piece of legislation because it was developed through I.V. stakeholders’ collective efforts.</p>\n<p>“Usually, legislation kind of just comes from Sacramento,” Schunk said. “To the contrary, Das Williams and his office have really kind of stepped up to the plate and done what I think is an outstanding job of really engaging the community.”</p>\n<p>Williams and the Initiative are asking for increased community involvement because of the bill’s importance to the I.V. self-governance movement, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“This bill is so monumental, so it deserves extra attention,” Schunk said. “Every resident of Isla Vista will somehow be impacted by this, so I think it’s critical that we try and hear from as many voices as possible.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he hopes to see a significant number of supporters turn out for the County Legislative Committee, Goleta City Council and LAFCO meetings, he has realistic expectations.</p>\n<p>“I would like to see at least 10 people at each of those meetings, and I don’t think that’s going to be outlandish,” Schunk said. “The more voices that are heard by these different entities, the more they realize that there is a broad and diverse backing for this movement.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he knows Associated Students will have a significant presence at the AB 3 events, but believes there will also be a strong turn out from non-A.S. students.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, I do expect a lot of A.S. members to be there, because those are typically the people who are politically engaged,” Schunk said. “I also do think that we’ve gotten quite a few students both from SBCC and from UCSB who are not involved in student government.”</p>\n<p>According to Dela Cruz, the series of events aims to also include non-student residents and Latino families who are not as involved in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“We had canvassing for the Family Fun Day … where we had volunteers to help us canvas, and just talked to the community,” Dela Cruz said. “Specifically, families for the Family Fun Day geared towards Isla Vista long-term residents and Latino families who don’t often come to our weekly AB 3 meetings on Tuesdays.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the goal of the AB 3 events is to show Sacramento legislators there is broad local support for the bill.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we are seeking endorsements from the County and Goleta as well as the residents of I.V. itself, getting people to every event is going to be challenge due to the meetings being scheduled during work/school hours and out of our control,” Abboud said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Recycling representative Kristen Herrera said UCSB students are conscious of environmental issues, but should make more of an effort to change their driving and recycling habits.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to the environment here at UCSB, we are very aware of the problems that happen out here,” Herrera said. “There is absolutely more room for improvement, like driving your car less, for example, but people should recycle every single day and our campus makes it so easy to recycle.”</p>\n<p>According to Herrera, A.S. Recycling is a readily available campus resource that students should be using consistently.</p>\n<p>“Associated Students Recycling aspires to help young people to change the environment like recycling plastic bottles,” Herrera said. “We have a lot of yearly support from the community and we are growing more and more.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62798\" style=\"width: 326px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62798\" data-attachment-id=\"62798\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/i-v-earth-day-highlights-environmental-issues/iv-earth-day-festival-anisqoyo-park-april-25th-2015-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,429\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1429981542&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IV Earth Day Festival\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62798 \" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3-250x179.jpg?resize=316%2C226\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"316\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Herrera said events such as I.V.

Food Cooperative and Associated Students met Thursday afternoon at the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>The time of remembrance will begin with a memorial tree-planting at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) and conclude with the MMXIV Music in Memory concert. Attendees of Thursday’s meeting discussed details for events such as the candlelight vigil on March 23 and the memorial paddle out on May 27, in addition to new ideas for crafts using recycled materials, potlucks at the food Co-op and Zumba dancing.</p>\n<p>A.S. Isla Vista Community Advisor Diana Collins Puente said I.V. Open Lab is planning a Blue Night art installation to feature blue and yellow LED lights throughout I.V. and campus.</p>\n<p>“They are actually going to light up as much of Isla Vista as possible, as well as campus,” Collins Puente said. “What they are really hoping to do is have businesses adopt that.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op Outreach and Education Coordinator Ashley Audycki said the Co-op wanted to host a potluck at the Pardall Center, and the meeting attendees decided the dinner should take place May 25.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and linguistics major and IVTU Vice President Alexandra Meallet said there should be forums for open discussion surrounding the series of memorial events.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s still a time when we’re becoming more comfortable with speaking about it [the May 23 tragedy] and I think open group discussion is pretty healthy,” Meallet said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Pardall Center staff member Natalie Dimas said her sorority Sigma Alpha Zeta has been discussing arranging a Zumba class if they could secure funding and coordinate with the Pardall Center staff.</p>\n<p>“Dancing can relieve stress and it is a method of coping,” Dimas said. “I’ve been looking around and seeing if I could find a Zumba instructor that would provide the class at a reduced price, if anything.”</p>\n<p>Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Director Jeanne Stanford said it is important to remember individuals cope with tragedy in different ways and to be respectful of other’s methods if they differ from your own.</p>\n<p>“I am aware of people who don’t want to hear anything else about it … and then there’s people that want to remember it,” Stanford said. “Whether you want to turn away from it or you want to delve into it, we shouldn’t be judging each other.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said C.A.P.S. staff will be available for anyone who wants to talk about the events of May 23 last year, but will not push their services on anyone who does not approach them.</p>\n<p>“We are not saying that anybody needs counseling,” Stanford said. “We didn’t do that last year, because we had just drop-in consultation, because it was an unusual event.”</p>\n<p>Audycki said she thinks local art stores would be willing to help provide craft supplies for an artistic-themed event to commemorate the tragedy and help students heal.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be really therapeutic for some people to be able to create with something that could’ve been destroyed,” Audycki said.</p>\n<p>Puentes said one goal of the memorial events is to tailor them to the variety of ways that students can cope with last year’s tragedy and find healing through community.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we are trying to do is help people access a lot of different ways to be involved, whether it’s more actively or passively,” Puentes said. “We definitely want to make sure that we have mental health and counselling services available to people in a place that is in the community.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said the memorial events will provide an opportunity to honor the students lost and restore faith in humanity.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, as human beings, we remember what happened,” Stanford said. “What we’re doing with remembrances and anniversary events are about community and about restoring people’s faith in humanity.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Tate holds the second most number of strikeouts and second best ERA in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the end of the world, but sometimes [losses] happen. I know the guys have my back,” Tate said. “I just need to keep doing what I’m doing, and I know they’ll back me up.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho pitching staff is up against a very hot and cold Fresno offense that is coming off a losing series against New Mexico, where it scored eight runs on Saturday and only one on Sunday. Before that, Fresno went on a five-game win streak against UCSB, San Jose and No. 21 Cal, where its lineup scored a total of 42 runs. The Bulldogs have scored at least six runs in their past seven outings.</p>\n<p>“I feel good about our starters. We need to get our bullpen guys in there, they didn’t get much work last weekend,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be high scoring or not, but I feel comfortable with our starters, but we need to work on minimizing their pitch count.”</p>\n<p>In a commanding spot of the Fresno lineup is junior catcher Taylor Ward who has accounted for 25 RBI this season. Ward currently holds a team high .359 batting average and a .485 on base percentage.</p>\n<p>“I think [the team is] going to be ready to go, and we learned a lot over this past weekend,” Checketts said. “We pitched great but we didn’t play great offense, but I think we’ll come in more prepared for this series than they were last weekend.”</p>\n<p>Though the Gaucho offense struggled for consistency in the previous Long Beach State series, UCSB still accounts for multiple offensive conference leaders. Nesovic tops the conference chart with 24 RBI this season and comes in at third for season batting average, as he hits for .372.</p>\n<p>“We need to be able to handle different types of pitchers,” Checketts said. “We’re going to try to give them some different looks in batting practice, and adjust based on style of pitching.”</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Cameron Newell comes in behind Nesovic for fifth in the conference with .347. On the base path, Leadoff hitter, redshirt sophomore Andrew Calica has had 10 stolen bases, the third most in Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB is also tied in the conference with UC Davis for overall team batting average with .298. Though UCSB falls slightly behind Davis in overall on-base percentage, the Gauchos lead the league in RBIs with 141 this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to have an away approach and focus on hitting the ball to the opposite side of the field,” Nesovic said. “I think we’ll do that fine this week.”</p>\n<p>The series against Fresno State will run from today through Saturday at home.
