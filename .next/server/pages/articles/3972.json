Nurseries and distributors will pay 1 percent of the total amount an organization receives during its accounting period; manufacturers will pay 3 percent, cultivators will pay 4 percent and retail and micro businesses will pay 6 percent, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>First District Supervisor Das Williams, who chairs the county board, said in a written statement that it is “imperative” that the marijuana is taxed to “ensure compliance and to eradicate the black market.”</p>\n<p>“With legalization comes needed enforcement, education and other services. Santa Barbara County needs to tax cannabis growers and businesses to enforce our ordinance and fund other priorities,” he said in an argument in favor of the measure, which he wrote on behalf of the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p>The board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/land-ordinance-limits-marijuana-sales-in-iv-uc-students-opposed/\">passed an ordinance</a> in early February requiring a buffer zone between marijuana dispensaries and areas with schools or daycare centers, meaning dispensaries cannot be located within 750 feet of these “sensitive areas.”</p>\n<p>Opponents of the measure, including District County Supervisor Peter Adam and Susan Brown, retired sergeant from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement that the measure will be “another blank check” for the county.</p>\n<p>“The County faces a $50 million deficit due to misplaced spending priorities,” the group that wrote the opposition statement on the ballot measure. “They want to spend the money how they want it spent, not how we want it spent.”</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board secretary for the CSD, said he is a big supporter of this measure because it is “necessary” for I.V. to have a dispensary one day.</p>\n<p>“The old I.V. residents would have loved to see this happen,” CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Senate passed a resolution on Wednesday to preserve El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room, which is used by several different cultural organizations on campus. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution to preserve the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room Wednesday following concerns that the historic building would be demolished in 45 days.</p>\n<p>The 40-year-old building is located behind the UCSB Library and is used as a gathering space for several cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>Senators Lesly Silva and Jesse Velasquez authored the resolution and presented it at Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting. The resolution supports student groups <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-13/students-told-to-evacuate-el-centro-annex-before-possible-demolition/\" target=\"_blank\">who have pushed to preserve the building</a>, asking that it be recognized as a cultural artifact.</p>\n<p>“El Centro Arnulfo Casillas is an open space that can be used and is used by many groups from every race, religion, gender identity, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, status, and creed,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Campus building official Ed Schmittgen sent a notice to campus architect Marc Fisher on Jan. 9 saying that consultants found the trailer’s integrity was compromised following inspection.</p>\n<p>The report lists insect infestation and dry rot on the building’s floor, rust and corrosion on supporting steel beams and lack of adequate ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor. It concludes that the building’s problems create an unsafe condition in case of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The building was categorized as a “severe” life risk per the UC Seismic Policy, Schmittgen said, and advised that the building be either improved or demolished in 45 days’ time. Administrators suggested that although the trailer would be difficult to preserve due to its 10-year lifespan, the building’s artwork could be relocated.</p>\n<p>Over 50 students gathered in the El Centro annex the following Friday to negotiate other options with campus administration. Among those in attendance were Schmittgen, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Vice Chancellor of Campus Design and Facilities Marc Fisher.</p>\n<p>Students listed several concerns, saying the 45-day evacuation timeline was restrictive, administrators had not maintained the building properly and the University could not remove students’ home-away-from-home.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB received distinction and grant money as a Hispanic Serving Institution in 2016, the A.S. resolution states “the Hispanic and Latinx community has seen little to no return on this money that their communities have been promised.”</p>\n<p>“It is clearly stated that ‘We, the UCSB Associated Students 67th Senate, represent and advocate for the undergraduate student body and strive to effectively address their concerns,’ and there is a clear argument that a large group of students who depend on this space want the 67th Senate to act upon their concerns and support them,” the resolution adds.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the A.S. Senate passed the resolution without objection.</p>\n<p>“At this point this has been an ongoing battle for about 45 years,” Senator Silva said. “The whole goal is to finally end this and make it a permanent space that isn’t being constantly threatened.”</p>\n<p>Students will gather in the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas Activity Room for another meeting with administration on Friday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/","id":3969,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3968,3967,3966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LIVE: California Midterm Election Results 2018","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/livemidtermresults-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/livemidtermresults-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus will be updating this page with live results from the California Midterm Election and the Santa Barbara County election. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The <em>Nexus</em> will be updating this page with live results from the Nov. 6 California Midterm Election and the Santa Barbara County election.

President Jimmy Villarreal’s veto of two bills at last week’s meeting. Their motions failed to pass.</em> John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students (A.S.) Senate met Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen to discuss A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal’s vetoes of two bills.</p>\n<p>The bills, “A Bill to Establish A.S. Commissions for the CCS Student Council and CoE Student Council” and “A Bill to Redefine the A.S. Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) Fund,” passed unanimously at last week’s Senate meeting. Public Forum included multiple College of Creative Studies (CCS) students speaking in support of the bill to establish student government in CCS and the College of Engineering (CoE).</p>\n<p>First-year CCS student Katie Feerst said CCS and CoE are underrepresented on campus, so she supports the bill to establish student government for the two colleges.</p>\n<p>“CCS has existed since 1967. We have been in UCSB for a long time, yet we have yet to have a student council,” Feerst said. “We should all have representation, even if we are smaller than College of Letters and Sciences. We should all be able to integrate as part of UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he vetoed the bill because the creation of a student government is a new concept in A.S., so legislation requires thorough editing before passing and becoming part of the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“Moving the association to a research-funding academic body — it very much changes what we do,” Villarreal said. “There’s an unnatural connection in what we do here and the educational side of things.”</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said Senate should override the presidential veto because the bill affects CCS students seeking grants for research.</p>\n<p>“There weren’t substantial reasons why it was vetoed, and as senators we could always put forward bills to modify,” Larrazolo said. “The space needs to be created while the momentum is here, and while the entire student population is requesting it.”</p>\n<p>Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said although A.S. Senate unanimously supports the bill, it should take the time to perfect the legal framework of creating a governmental entity.</p>\n<p>“We realize the need for representation and for money for these students,” Elyasi said. “They are an underrepresented college. The issue is: where does that money come from and in what way is that money distributed?”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said Senate should not have the power to regulate a student’s research if CCS and CoE governments are formed as A.S. commissions.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to say what you can or can’t do,” Ninh said. “We don’t have the understanding that CCS does. I doubt all of us can access the knowledge of what it is to be a CCS student.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said Senate reserves the right to overlook how money is spent, but should listen to the two colleges on how to spend grant money.</p>\n<p>“They know how to spend the money better than we spend the money, so if they recommend that things should be spent on this grant, then yeah I would go with them,” Mariano said. “I don’t believe the senate should not strike minutes, since we are the overseers.</p>\n<p>We look at the money to make sure that the money is spent appropriately.”</p>\n<p>The motions to override the presidential vetoes on “A Bill to Establish A.S. Commissions for the CCS Student Council and CoE Student Council” and “A Bill to Redefine the A.S. S.T.A.R.K Fund” failed to pass.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, October 29 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/students-discuss-bills-vetoed-by-a-s-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/students-discuss-bills-vetoed-by-a-s-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/students-discuss-bills-vetoed-by-a-s-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/students-discuss-bills-vetoed-by-a-s-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/students-discuss-bills-vetoed-by-a-s-president/","id":3971,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3970,3969,3968],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
