Community Council (IVCC) made several other attempts to give I.V. a more sustainable form of government in the years following.</p>\n<p><strong>1972: I.V. Creates Community Services District (CSD)</strong></p>\n<p>Other options for self-governance for I.V. also included the 1972 passage of a bill by the California legislature establishing the I.V. College Community Services District (IVCCSD). This action created a community services district (CSD), a small form of independent government that allows a given unincorporated area to tax itself to provide certain services to itself that cannot otherwise be provided by a county government.</p>\n<p>According to alumnus Josh Plotke, who acted as a research assistant to the recently released UCSB Foundation Trustees’ Advisory Committee on Isla Vista Strategies, I.V. residents pushed for a CSD in hopes of working up to later establishing a city.</p>\n<p>“They tried to create a city without calling it a city,” Plotke said. “They tried to create a law with a CSD with more extended powers than CSD law allowed.”</p>\n<p>Plotke also said the university was opposed to being included in the IVCCSD, which contributed to its ultimate failure.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it failed was the county said they [the CSD] had to include UCSB,” Plotke said. “UCSB at first acted neutral and then hired a publicist and spent $100,000 for a publicist to fight against this thing.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, Plotke said the California state legislature passed a law outlining I.V. as a special legislative district, — or a government created by the legislature to oversee a specific area — which initiated the I.V. Municipal Advisory Council (IVMAC). A municipal advisory council is a body of elected or appointed officials that convene to assess the needs of a given city or county government and recommend specific action. While a CSD can govern by controlling specific services provided to an area, a MAC serves a purely advisory role and has no actual power to provide services.</p>\n<p>Despite the formation of the CSD on paper, the IVCCSD was never implemented as it also required the approval of the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for Santa Barbara County, an independent state-mandated entity responsible for overseeing the establishment of local governments, which rejected the proposal.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58943\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1694545327\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58941\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58943\" data-attachment-id=\"58943\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/i-v-a-history-part-ii/iv-self-governance-feature-ii-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,647\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IVCC members seemed to be enjoying themselves at last Monday night's meeting.

The plan would incorporate all three areas as portions of the city of Santa Barbara and greatly expand its municipal borders. The university came out in support of the annexation plan, with then-chancellor Vernon Cheadle stating it would provide “the lowest long term tax rates for the greatest number of citizens.”</p>\n<p>The annexation plan was put to an election in March of 1975 that required a majority of voters in both the Goleta Valley area and the City of Santa Barbara to approve the plan. Despite university support for the measure, overwhelming majorities of both I.V. and Santa Barbara residents voted against it and the measure failed.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident Carmen Lodise’s book <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, after I.V.’s failure of annexation to Santa Barbara, the IVCC called for a new advisory election, or plebiscite, to determine the best option for a local government for I.V. Options presented were incorporation of I.V. into a city, incorporation of I.V. with Goleta or maintenance of the status quo. The election, held on May 27, 1975, resulted in an overwhelming majority of support for the independent incorporation of I.V as a city, which at the time had its proposed boundaries include Storke Road, Hollister Avenue and the Venoco Corporation’s Platform Holly oil rig.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, the UC Board of Regents was split in its opinion on cityhood for I.V., with at least five regents supporting the proposal. The university, Lodise writes, was opposed to cityhood.</p>\n<p>Following the results of the May, 1975 plebiscite, IVCC made another submission for independent cityhood to LAFCO in 1975 backed with support from the university, which LAFCO rejected again in February of 1976 on a 4-1 vote, citing concerns over the financial feasibility of an incorporated I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons Behind Failure of I.V. Cityhood</strong></p>\n<p>Lodise said he blames the political motivations of the LAFCO members for not approving I.V. cityhood, as the four no votes all came from Republicans on LAFCO, while the only yes came from a Democrat.</p>\n<p>“The wrap was that I.V. was not financially feasible,” Lodise said. “In reality, it was Republicans [on LAFCO] defeating the town because [I.V.] was overwhelmingly Democratic.”</p>\n<p>Plotke said LAFCO could not approve those proposals because various fiscal analyses have found I.V. cityhood to be unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is a big financial drain. It’s a small tax space with a dense population that means increased expenses,” Plotke said. “It would be illegal for LAFCO to approve a city.”</p>\n<p>Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em> stated that concerns over financial feasibility of I.V. as a city were misguided but important for the Republicans on LAFCO. Lodise wrote that LAFCO was commonly thought to produce numbers on the expenditures a proposed city would make, when in practice such figures are typically determined by the city’s first city council.</p>\n<p>Lodise also stated LAFCO had no authority to use financial feasibility as a criteria in determining the viability of incorporation for a given area.</p>\n<p><strong>I.V. Self-Governance Burns Out</strong></p>\n<p>For the next few years the only governmental entities existing in I.V. were those related to IVCC and the I.V. Parks and Recreation District (IVRPD). The IVRPD oversaw the growth of new parks in I.V. beginning in 1975, adding 14 new parks to a list that originally included Anisq’Oyo Park on Embarcadero Del Mar, “Dogshit” Park along Del Playa Drive and Children’s Park on Picasso Rd.</p>\n<p>Despite this growth, little in the way of additional self-governance campaigns materialized in the years between 1975 and 1982.</p>\n<p>According to Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History,</em> years of tension between the residents of I.V. and Goleta over representation on the Goleta Water Board, which provided water services to both unincorporated areas, contributed to renewed fervor for cityhood for I.V.</p>\n<p>The 1982 IVCC election saw a slate of candidates elected who supported independent cityhood for I.V. and opposed an incorporation plan that included Goleta, which was supported by IVCC executive director John Buttny, who promptly resigned after the election. Also in 1982, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors refused to contribute its portion of funds to the IVCC, a loss of about $10,000. Shortly thereafter, the university, also a key provider of funds to IVCC, also discontinued its funding of the council, an amount of about $9,000, according to Lodise. Funding for the council by the Board of Regents also ended entirely in 1982 after a steady decline from its peak in 1971.</p>\n<p>Despite the funding cuts, the IVCC pressed on with a cityhood proposal, filing it with LAFCO in 1984 which was again rejected in a 4-1 vote. The council lasted for several more years, but without funding went defunct in 1987.</p>\n<p>According to Plotke, after the IVCC and IVMAC lost funding, prompting residents to push for a CSD to try and recover some form of self-governance for the I.V. However, he said, proponents realized that funding for a CSD could not be started until long after the IVCC and IVMAC disappeared, which effectively ended the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“They found that there was going to be a gap in funding from the time the funding [for IVCC and IVMAC] was cut off to a time a CSD could be established,” Plotke said.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident, local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman, self-governance talks went on hiatus for over a decade after the defeat of IVCC and IVMAC. He said the group of activists who had helped initiate all the prior movements had lost energy.</p>\n<p>“I think they burned out,” Freeman said. “When they burned out, there was no one there to make this happen in the same way that they did.”</p>\n<p>Self-governance options for I.V. did not become a prominent part of local politics again for over another decade, when Goleta moved to incorporate in 2001.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT THE <em>DAILY NEXUS</em> WEBSITE TOMORROW FOR PART THREE OF THE SERIES: 2000s — present</strong></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to LAFCO as a state controlled agency.

It’s difficult for me to put down money for my new unit.”</p>\n<p>Meallet said IVTU is hosting frequent events on Pardall Road in order to bring attention to the tenant rights violations committed by property owners who do not have a stake in the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to give the broader community a free bite to eat and make some free tie-dye so we get the chance to tell them about the situation that’s going on,” Meallet said. “Hopefully so they will support us, sign the petition and come to our picket next Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the legal aid IVTU has provided her and other tenants in the past year has been vital to helping rectify the eviction issues that have been occurring to many low-income tenants in I.V.</p>\n<p>“IVTU has provided lots of emotional and financial help during this time,” Martinez said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61222\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61222\" data-attachment-id=\"61222\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/ivtu-continues-tenant-rights-campaign/ivtu-rally_brendan-mansfield-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"9\",\"credit\":\"T J Carmody\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424456549\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU Rally\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61222\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-Rally_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61222\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>IVTU President and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov said IVTU’s aid to the community goes beyond the situation at the Abrego Villas, as the organization will work to prevent any possible conflicts with tenant evictions in the future.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to support the tenants in their legal process and provide assistance,” Bogdanov said. “Not just legal but also emotional.

First Fridays and featured a wide array of music by female artists, a hot chocolate booth, dancing, live art and a photo booth.</p>\n<p>Spatial art professor and creator of First Fridays Kim Yasuda said she wanted to find ways for people to heal after the I.V. shootings through events that foster positivity and security during weekends in I.V.</p>\n<p>“All that happened in the spring, that was so hard,” Yasuda said. “Knowing that so many students were coming back in the fall and there was just no vehicle for healing … I have always believed that our culture could provide a space for positive engagement in counter to what seems to be the sensibility when a tragedy happens.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said I.V. First Fridays made use of UCSB Nobel Prize winner and materials professor Shuji Nakamura’s invention, energy efficient LED lights, to brighten the block party. The Womyn’s Commission constructed an outdoor lounge in the park, complete with couches and LED Christmas lights wrapped around the skeleton of a geodesic dome.</p>\n<p>According to the supporting coordinator of Womyn’s Commission, third-year global studies major Cassie Rubio, the social atmosphere of I.V. can cause some students to feel threatened, which is why the organization felt it was important to host an alternative event.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times Isla Vista can feel very unsafe and predatory so we decided to create a cool vibe where people can hang out and meet each other but also being conscious about the different issues surrounding them,” Rubio said.</p>\n<p>Third-year film &amp; media studies major Ashley Baker, who collaborated with Yasuda for I.V. First Fridays and photographs the events, said students were at liberty to organize the event in any way they saw fit.</p>\n<p>“She gave us free reign to do anything that we wanted and she encouraged our creativity, which is something that I’m not used to,” Baker said. “When did most professors ask the students ‘It’s anything that you want to do’? We made up our curriculum and activities for this.”</p>\n<p>According to Womyn’s Commission co-chair and third-year comparative literature and global studies major Danielle Maldonado, the event is used as a platform to advocate for women’s rights and representation.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to take this opportunity to empower women, so all of our performers are female,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>Rubio said she hopes to see more events like the block party in the future, where people can showcase talent that is not usually recognized while providing a safe alternative to the “I.V. party scene.”</p>\n<p>“I hope that this won’t be the last block party,” Rubio said. “I hope that more and more venues like this are set up for female performers to be celebrated and shown off to I.V. because we have a lot of talent that doesn’t get enough credit they deserve.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59626\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59626\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-11/womyns-commission-throws-2015s-inaugural-first-friday/","id":4795,"author":{"id":175,"name":"Rishika Kenkre"},"related":[4794,4793,4792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Jan. 9-11","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C232&ssl=1","description":"This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the eld...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past week, law enforcement officers with UCSB Police Department (UCPD) and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) responded to various incidents including noise ordinance infractions, abuse of the elderly and theft.</p>\n<p>According to a weekly crime report, during the night shift last Wednesday law enforcement officers attempted to issue a noise ordinance violation on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. During the confrontation with a resident of the home, the officers noticed a student attempting to conceal half an ounce of marijuana for which he did not have a medical card by destroying it. When the officers approached the individual, he provided a false identity and was subsequently arrested.</p>\n<p>The following day, officers stopped a vehicle from “Jump on the School Bus” transportation while it was loading passengers on Ocean Road and Trigo Road. The bus was playing excessively loud music and honking its horn to catch the attention of potential nearby riders, which led to the officers on patrol to question bus driver Nicholas Zwart. UCPD officers cited Zwart for not having insurance, and warned Zwart against loading the bus on campus.</p>\n<p>This past Friday officers logged 9 arrests and 22 citations, with a notable charge for abuse of the elderly. Officers were called to check the welfare of a 68-year-old amputee and Vietnam War veteran at Friendship Manor on Friday night. The victim’s caretaker, Russell Tokle, had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Upon entering his apartment, the officers found it unsanitary to the point of being uninhabitable, littered with things like cat feces and rotten food. Tokle was arrested for his previous warrant and is under view for elder abuse. The victim was granted an immediate move out of the apartment and taken into the care of Adult Protective Services.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, officers responded to a noise citation on the 6500 block of Segovia. Around midnight, the resident said he would turn down his loud music, but at 2 a.m. the music resumed its high volume. Officers returned to the residence, shut down the party and issued a noise citation. As party-goers filed onto the street from the party, law enforcement officers noticed one man too intoxicated to take care of himself. While attempting to place him into the patrol car, a fellow student interfered, attempting to stop officers from arresting the man. Following the altercation, both students were arrested for a drunk in public citation and a citation for interfering with law enforcement, respectively.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP units responded to a theft call at the Subway on Pardall Road. Upon arrival, officers found the victim fighting with the suspected perpetrator and ended the conflict immediately. During the investigation, deputies determined that the suspect was in possession of the victim’s backpack, an iPhone and several other stolen items. The suspect was then arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to a call about a male breaking a window at the 7-Eleven on Seville Road this past Saturday. IVFP deputies located the suspect, Larry Anthony Ortiz, who was covered in blood and appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. Ortiz had broken a window at 7-Eleven, along with a window of a nearby car parked on Sabado Tarde. Ortiz was arrested for vandalism and later charged with battery against a police officer after spitting in the deputy’s face.</p>\n<p>Deputies responded to another report of vandalism on Sunday, this time at the Isla Vista Clinic on Embarcadero del Mar. Upon arrival, police observed another broken window and blood spatter in the area. Deputies believe this incident to be related to the vandalism arrest from the night before.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59688\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59688\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/weekend-wrap-up-jan-9-11/","id":4796,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4795,4794,4793],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
