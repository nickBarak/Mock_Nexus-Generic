Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) board members, county officials and I.V. residents gathered at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar to celebrate the new Isla Vista Community Center’s soft opening. The hard opening date has yet to be released, but I.V. CSD board members are hoping to hold an  official opening sometime between January and March to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the February 1970 I.V. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bank burning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here celebrating how far we’ve come because it wasn’t that long ago, this building was about to fall over,” said I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no current activities or initiatives are slated for the community center, Brandt said he was interested in using the space to run a variety of programs. Potential ways in which residents may be able to use the space include English classes, homework help for school children, computer literacy classes, yoga classes and a litany of other similar programs, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD paid the Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) $177,000, using funds obtained by a tax on all I.V. residents’ utilities, to manage the community center for one year, according to Lori Goodman, executive director of IVYP. Goodman added that approximately $150,000 of the money will be used to pay its two full-time staff members, while the rest is for potential programs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The County of Santa Barbara paid for the majority of renovations to the building, spending $1,320,000 to replace the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, build two bathrooms and install a kitchen. About $400,000 of that money came from the county’s general fund, according to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann; the rest came from the federal government through Community Development Block Grants, which Hartmann said made the project possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on community feedback, the I.V. CSD is planning additional renovations to the building, including covering the cement ground of the center with hardwood floor. The district is also looking into grants which could further fund renovations, according to Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space has always been a hub for the community of Isla Vista back when I came here in the 60s,” said I.V. CSD Board Member Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, who used to run his church out of the building.  “One of the reasons our community kind of flailed, is because we didn’t have a community center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soft opening inspired Carmen Lodise, who lived in Isla Vista for 30 years and was one of the original activists fighting for a community center, to come from his home in Mexico to witness what he had been wanting to see for decades. Lodise is also the author of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wonderful. It brought tears to my eyes,” Lodise said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efforts to open the center began in the 1970s, when the building that now houses the Isla Vista Clinic was sold, prompting activists to seek a new space where everyone in the community could congregate, according to Lodise’s book. The calls for a community center would go unfulfilled until the county bought the community center building, formerly a church and bank, in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?fbclid=IwAR3QaUeBMMhQK_y2x2568or0Cmjdyrxma-7hGTLh3PsmHbDRalDbqA86r1E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2012</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD wants more community input on possible uses for the community center before committing to any specific programming, according to Brandt. Diana Collins Puente floated the idea that UC Santa Barbara professors could use the community center for class space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a litany of historical hiccups and delays, the community center — long awaited by many — marks a milestone in the eyes of a town that is eager to put such a facility to use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been a gleam in people’s eyes for decades, but it really took a lot at the last minute to get this done,” Hartmann said during a speech.</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Biko Garage held a voting information night on Monday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The infonight focused specifically on the statewide ballot propositions. Event organizers provided students with the overview, background, pros, cons and endorsements of Proposition 1 through Proposition 12, excluding Proposition 9.</p>\n<p>Proposition 9 was<a href=\"https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/prop-9-supreme-court-ruling.pdf\"> removed from the ballot</a> in July by the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Rain Kahsu, organizer of the Biko Voting Infonight and fourth-year political science student, said she wanted to hold this event after speaking to her housemates about the election and realizing that “we were all freaking out.”</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to have an event where I could be with members of the community and my friends and just talk about this kind of stuff that’s kind of scary. There’s so much information,” Kahsu said.</p>\n<p>Approximately 20 people attended and discussed each proposition, asking questions about the issues, providing clarifications and offering personal opinions.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the propositions discussed was Proposition 8, which would limit the amount of money kidney dialysis clinics could charge for treatment.</p>\n<p>As with the other propositions, organizers went over the pros and cons, stating that clinics would be prevented from treating patients differently based on what type of insurance they have, so the proposition could result in the closure of “many” California dialysis clinics.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had their phones out throughout the event, googling specific proposition language and facts to aid the conversation.</p>\n<p>At one point, an attendee frustrated with the complex and vague language of the propositions exclaimed, “Why is it so difficult to fucking vote?”</p>\n<p>While the remark was met with laughs, the sentiment was echoed by several students at the event.</p>\n<p>Kahsu hoped students attending the event would come and “gain information they didn’t know and be able to ask questions” and “be able to talk about how they’re going to vote or things they’ve heard.”</p>\n<p>For fourth-year global studies major Naima Sudjian-Carlisle, Monday’s event was an opportunity to be involved with a community event where students could learn from each other.</p>\n<p>“I procrastinated in researching what’s on the ballot, what people to vote for and everything like that,” Sudjian-Carlisle said. “I was really glad to hear different perspectives on propositions. I’m now informed for voting tomorrow, but I still want to do some research tonight.”</p>\n<p>Other attendees agreed that it was helpful to get together with community members to talk about the ballot before voting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“The proposition language can be really confusing, so it’s helpful to just be in a group with other people and go through them to kind of pick them apart to see what is actually the intention of each proposition,” said Solmaz Soleimani, a UCSB Class of 2018 graduate.</p>\n<p>Kat Ghodoosian, a third-year political science student, emphasized the importance of being an informed voter. She said the event helped her “get more of a nuanced perspective.”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s one thing to go out and register and vote, but it’s another thing to be an informed voter,” Ghodoosian said. “UCSB students should feel responsible not only to be registered and to go out to the polls, but they should also be responsible for knowing what’s on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>Attendees left the event around 6:30 p.m., with several promising to post their further research on the propositions on the Biko Garage Facebook page before the election the next day.</p>\n<p>Kahsu was optimistic about how the info night had gone, stating she hoped attendees were able to walk away “a little more informed and a little less anxious.”</p>\n<p>“Vote and, even more than that, try to be more engaged in politics and with your community,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

Coffee Organiks is simple: Coffee is delivered straight to a customer’s door anytime between 6 a.m. to 8:30 a.m Monday through Thursday, and 6 a.m. to 11:30 a.m Friday through Sunday, thus eliminating the inconvenience of idling at storefronts such as Starbucks or Caje for a morning cup of joe, said Trump.</p>\n<p>“If we can wake up Isla Vista with fresh coffee, deliver it to your door and cut out mediocre coffee that is victimizing our friends, then it’s a job well done,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>Trump estimates roughly three to four pounds of coffee beans are brewed weekly to meet demands.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks starts their day earlier than most, preparing to wake I.V. by roasting fresh beans around 5 a.m. Cold brew is also “soaked in a sanitized vessel that extracts the flavor from the beans,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>“We pack our bags, put our earphones on and greet the person with their coffee.”</p>\n<p>Customers can order 16 oz. of hot or iced coffee for $3.50 and cold brew for $4, according to the company’s Facebook page. For 50 cents, customers can add hemp seed milk, almond milk or wildflower honey.</p>\n<p>All orders come with cane sugar and half &amp; half cream and customers who provide their own mug will receive 50 cents off.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks sources its beans directly from farmers Trump has personally engaged with while working on coffee plantations in Central America. Beans from countries such as Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and many others, have already made their way into the mugs of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>Quality is the paramount aspect of Coffee Organiks and often a characteristic that is hard to come by in the coffee served in Isla Vista, said Trump.</p>\n<p>“[In I.V.] I don’t think there is anyone out there that can beat the quality of our coffee,” he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks’ first round of deliveries brewed more demand than expected. Trump noted in a Facebook post that the Peruvian blend sold out in a matter of three days.</p>\n<p>In addition to his Central American coffee blends, Trump is also looking to impress the caffeine-cravers of Isla Vista by securing an agreement with a chef in New York to expand Coffee Organiks’ menu to include domestic flavors as well.</p>\n<p>Trump has faith Coffee Organiks will continue to satisfy I.V.’s palate, adding they are “flirting with the idea of a coffee subscription” which would allow customers to have coffee delivered every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis for a discounted price.</p>\n<p>Also in the works along is an app, which would allow users to order coffee through their phones, he said.</p>\n<p>Coffee Organiks is not Trump’s first experience in caffeinated enterprises.</p>\n<p>Trump’s first introduction to the coffee industry was during a trip to Central America in 2012. During his time in Atenas, Costa Rica, Trump gained knowledge about the process of producing coffee beans while working at a coffee plantation owned by the Carlos family, a family he continues to source beans from for Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“I grew a stronger passion once I started working on the coffee fields,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>After returning to California to work as a chef for Google, Trump had a casual conversation about coffee with his roommates, which, after some experimentation and taste-testing, ushered the idea of a coffee delivery service into fruition.</p>\n<p>Trump came to UCSB after he was offered a scholarship in molecular biology. After only a year of being a Gaucho, he officially launched Coffee Organiks.</p>\n<p>“Nothing is better than someone who takes a sip of our coffee and is immediately in a better mood,” Trump said when asked about his favorite part of the process.</p>\n<p>All products from Coffee Organiks are brewed in a sanitized kitchen under a food handler’s license.</p>\n<p>Orders can be placed at Coffee Organiks’ Instagram @Coffeeorganiks or on the company’s Facebook.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
