Naloxone is a medication that temporarily blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and keeps the opioid from being able to attach to those receptors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the training, free Naloxone nasal spray kits were handed out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>About 45 students and community members were present at the first training on Tuesday. The second training will be held on Thursday, April 4 at 7 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The start of the trainings follows a public health announcement sent out by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead on March 20. The announcement said that in the past few weeks, “three Isla Vista residents suffered from an apparent overdose of opioids,” and while two were revived with the use of Naloxone, the third did not survive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>UCSB’s Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada later clarified to the <em>Nexus </em>that the overdose resulting in death did not occur in I.V. , and the individual was not an I.V.  resident, as had been stated in the announcement sent out to all UCSB students.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The trainings, however, were not held as a result of the most recent overdoses, according to Angie Bryan, the recovery program manager and a recovery specialist for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program. In fact, planning for the trainings has been in the works for a little over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan first proposed an overdose prevention protocol to Student Health during March 2018, and the standing order was approved by the director of behavioral health in October of 2018, Bryan said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan was approved for a Naloxone grant through the California Department of Public Health’s Naloxone Distribution Project in November 2018, and received a supply of Naloxone in December 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan led Tuesday’s Naloxone training in the I.V. Community Room.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve been a counselor at UCSB for almost 15 years,” Bryan said at the beginning of the training. “Naloxone is something I’m really passionate about in terms of making sure that we get it into as many hands and homes as possible because I think it’s important for students to feel empowered to do something.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Students are the ones that are gonna be there in those first moments that an overdose might happen.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan discussed preventative measures that students could take, such as using fentanyl test strips and various drug testing kits that can test for a range of substances, along with how to reduce the risk of using certain substances.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She then asked attendees for what they think signs of an overdose are, to which attendees responded with an individual being unresponsive, having pinpoint pupils and having discoloration of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But even after Naloxone is administered, 911 still needs to be called, Bryan explained.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan demonstrated the use of Naloxone by asking an attendee to volunteer to lie on the ground acting as an individual who overdosed. She then went through the hypothetical motions of using the nasal spray on the volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan said that all law enforcement officers and paramedics in I.V. carry Naloxone, including UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol, and emphasized that a person who calls law enforcement in response to an overdose cannot be charged with a misdemeanor crime of possession or being under the influence.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, that is not the case for felony-type charges, Bryan said. For example, if one has an excessive amount of drugs that seems like an intent to sell, law enforcement could investigate that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jeike Meijer, the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), collaborated with Bryan on the trainings after Bryan received the Naloxone grant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“We sat down, we had a meeting, we kind of tried to think about when would be the best time to have [the trainings], and we thought before Deltopia was the best,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer said preparing students for overdose situations as opposed to just discouraging drug use is a more effective route for keeping students safe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s really important to not just say ‘don’t do drugs,’ because people will do it, and it’s good to know how to be safe in the case of an emergency,” Meijer said. “Even if you don’t think that you’ll be using opioids, you might have a neighbor, or a housemate [who does].”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer added that the public health announcement sent out to UCSB students which mentioned the recent opioid overdoses reiterates the necessity of Naloxone trainings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m hoping that conversations and de-stigmatization… will allow people to get the help they need.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Along with Bryan, Meijer also hopes to help with more Naloxone trainings in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Angie had all of the information and all of the knowledge to bring,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s always people working on projects and there’s always someone who’s going to know more than you, and you have to know when to step back and let them take the wheel but give them all of the power you have,” Meijer said. “I don’t know how to do the trainings, but I can give the space.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Mustangs junior pitcher Justin Calomeni then ended any hopes of a Gaucho comeback after striking out the last two batters, earning his sixth save, and giving his team the 4-3 victory and series sweep.</p>\n<p>Before finishing off the sweep, Cal Poly rallied of 10 runs while limiting Santa Barbara to five runs to—at the very least at the time—seal the series win over their blue rival.</p>\n<p>After allowing two runs in the top of the first inning, the Mustangs responded with a four-run first inning, due in large part to Sanderson two-RBI double, to take an early 4-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tied the game at four in the top of the second inning thanks to senior third baseman Ryan Clark’s RBI single and redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s RBI single. Cal Poly added on run in the bottom frame to retake a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs would add two more runs in the bottom of the third inning to now take an even bigger lead at 7-4.</p>\n<p>By this point in the game, freshman pitcher Noah Davis (3-2) was sat after four innings. It was the young pitchers worst outing of the season allowing seven runs on eight hits including allowing one home run.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the rest of the game, Cal Poly added three runs compared to Santa Barbara’s one and won the game fairly easily after struggling to stop UCSB’s high-powered offense in the first few innings.</p>\n<p>It was another solid outing for star Mustang pitcher Erich Uelman (5-0) who pitched eight innings allowing five runs on eight hits but more importantly extended his perfect record this season to 5-0.</p>\n<p>Before losing only its second weekend series of the season, the Gauchos displayed their worst performance of the season being blanked 7-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB registered two hits over the course of nine innings, its worst total of the season but Cal Poly took advantage of its rival slow day scoring seven runs on thirteen hits.</p>\n<p>Gaucho junior pitcher Shane Bieber (7-2) kept the game close early allowing three runs in the games first six innings however, in the final two innings he came undone allowing four runs.</p>\n<p>Bieber came into the game hot off two straight complete-game victories and a 2.74 season ERA but was taken to school by the Mustang hitters and handed the pitcher his second loss of the season.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly won thanks to big performances from great players such as senior Josh Schuknecht who had two hits and three RBI, sophomore Josh George who went 3-4 (.750) with one RBI and Meyer who had two hits.</p>\n<p>The top four hitters of the Mustang line-up went 9-17 (.529) with six RBI in their strong victory over one of the better teams in the country.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend was a bad one for the Gauchos. Not only did they get swept and now fell in the standings but really showed its vulnerability going on the road. They are now 4-8-1 on the road this season.</p>\n<p>With eight of its final 20 games on the road, UCSB cannot afford to drop all those games—especially the conference ones—simply because it is away from the comfort ability of home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue end their four-game road stand against St. Mary’s on Tuesday, April 26 at 3 p.m. at Dickinson Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Gaels host UCSB with a 22-15 record, 10-5 conference record and have lost four of their last six games.</p>\n<p>These two teams are no strangers as they had an earlier match-up this season which saw St. Mary’s gut out a 7-4 victory after a five-run eighth inning. The loss was the first Santa Barbara had suffered this season after starting 4-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That loss was a brutal one for pitcher Trevor Bettancourt (2-1) who came in relief in the eighth inning and allowed five runs on five hits and credited with the loss.</p>\n<p>However, the redshirt junior has bounced back mightily after that brutal 2/3’s inning of relief. Since then the righty has allowed only seven hits and one earned run in 15.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason Bettancourt had such a rough time is because the Gaels have a slew of hitters that can take it to any pitcher in the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>These hitters include players such as sophomores Zach Kirtley and outfielder Joey Fiske. The two sophomores rank first and second in batting average with .360 and .331 respectively.</p>\n<p>Kirtley is first on the team in slugging percentage (.566) and on-base percentage (.473). The infielder is also tied for first in home runs (5), hits (49) and RBI (27).</p>\n<p>Senior infielder Anthony Villa is another strong hitter for St. Mary’s as he is also tied for first with Kirtley in home runs and RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior Nate Nolan is another viable hitter ranking second in hits (41), RBI (23), and slugging percentage (.500). The catcher had a solid game last time against UCSB going 3-5 (.600) with three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Although the Gaels are a strong hitting team, the Gauchos have their own slew of hitters that make them dangerous on any given day.</p>\n<p>They are led by sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (26) and is second in hits (35), and slugging percentage (.466). Redshirt junior outfielder Andrew Calica leads the team in hits (37) ranks second in on base percentage (.477) and fourth in batting average (.291).</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomores JJ Muno, a second baseman, and Josh Adams, designated hitter, both lead the team in home runs with four each. Adams also ranks second in RBI with a solid 23 on the season.</p>\n<p>A player who has also come on as of late is redshirt junior Devon Gradford who now leads the team in batting average (.387) and slugging percentage (.486).</p>\n<p>This weekday game will look to be a bounce back for the Gauchos. Although they are still having a solid season, being swept is never an easy thing to bounce back from especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>One problem  facing Santa Barbara this game and the entire season is the fact that they are on the road. Currently the Gauchos are 5-9-1 away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium and have lost four of their last six on the road.</p>\n<p>This game against the Gaels is important to see not only how UCSB will respond to its three-game losing streak, longest of the season, and how it can try to avenge its loss to the Gaels earlier this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end their four-game road stand against St. Mary’s on today at 3 p.m. at Louis Guisto Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
