Not only is it an incredibly tense, ridiculously funny and shockingly unnerving film, but it’s also an immersive thrill-ride. While the film is surprisingly impressive, it’s even more jaw-dropping when you consider that “Get Out” is Jordan Peele’s directorial debut. While Peele brings along his knack for humor, don’t be deceived; “Get Out” is intensely thrilling and insanely smart. It’s the rare film that’s a perfect mix of comedy and suspense, all the while remaining an absolute blast.</p>\n<p>When his girlfriend invites him to meet her family, Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, decides to go, knowing all too well the inevitable and uncomfortable topic of his skin tone. However, nothing could prepare him for what actually lies at the Armitage homestead. Surrounded by elitist, white, upper-class citizens, African-American servants and heavy doses of passive-aggressive racism, Chris can’t help but feel an overwhelming desire to, well, get out.</p>\n<p>Right out of the gate, “Get Out’’ opens with a perfect start that comfortably situates the audience into the unnerving, chuckled tone of the film. With its simple setup and seemingly basic plot, the film’s modest layout would normally signal a run-of-the-mill slasher film. But, as time passes, its structure and narrative become increasingly layered and complicated, proving that this movie is anything but your usual horror flick. There’s a clear crescendo as the film goes on, a rise that leads to both a maddening insanity and a worthwhile payoff. But this progression and escalation is so well-guided due to its intricate and layered plot that the film succeeds where less intelligent ones would fail. The film’s success lies in the fact that it uses this intelligent design for the purpose of entertainment. While sections of “Get Out” do address deeper and politically sensitive topics, the film never becomes a lecture on political awareness, nor does it ever forget its best quality: its ability to entertain with gripping humor and suspenseful horror.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Peele has absolutely coated and smothered the first half of the film with foreshadowing. Long after you’ve left the theater, these once-hidden details and premonitions will begin to click in your brain, allowing you to uncover aspects of the film you weren’t originally conscious of. This attention to detail makes “Get Out” the kind of movie you can watch over and over again without ever getting bored. This technique is mostly found in Peele’s often tongue-in-cheek script. Dialogue is riddled with references and coded words that stand out like a sore thumb. In the paranoid setting, you begin to question even the smallest details. Nearly every line seems to have a hidden meaning, and by the end of the film, the script’s payoff is nearly mind-blowing. It’s jam-packed with so many hidden goodies that it would be nearly impossible to grab everything on the first go. “Get Out” definitely warrants multiple viewings.</p>\n<p>The same attention to detail can be found in the film’s sound design. While the score is a bit lackluster and often falls to the background, the sound design ends up by playing an integral role in both the narrative and the immersive nature of the film. Distinct sounds will begin to stand out and change meaning as the film goes on, playing into both the plot and the characters’ personalities. It sounds a bit complicated, but it works so seamlessly and on so many levels without much effort on behalf of the audience.</p>\n<p>These tricks and techniques transform “Get Out” into some kind of participatory mystery-thriller. It’s like the movie begs the audience to solve its puzzle. All the pieces are there for you to figure it out, you just need to pay attention to the detailed clues. And that’s part of what makes “Get Out” so much fun; its engagement of the audience. However, as much as you try to figure it all out, the film’s shocking twists will surprise even the most careful observer.</p>\n<p>The film also closely follows the protagonist, rarely showing us something that he hasn’t seen himself. It’s in this connection to Chris that the film relays most of its humor and suspense. The most horrifying moments are to be found when the camera lingers on a single shot, refusing to cut away. Like Chris, we are forced to helplessly watch as some terrifying force comes running straight toward us without any breaks. It’s a refreshing step away from the jump-scare. Taking advantage of its incredible sound design, this kind of experience also occurs in the much-advertised hypnosis scene in the film. I won’t give anything away, but I can tell you that it’s been a long time since I’ve felt that uncomfortable while watching a movie. The rhythmic and nerve-wracking sounds force you to experience Chris’s stress almost too well.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_76124\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1227778867\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76122\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76124\" data-attachment-id=\"76124\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/film-title-get-out/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1586&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1586\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Film Title: Get Out\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?fit=888%2C688&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76124\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2-250x194.jpg?resize=250%2C194\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=768%2C595&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C793&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/get-out-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>As a character, Chris’s calm demeanor can sometimes come off as a bit bland. But this reserved performance seems more intentional, displaying his ability to deal with the constant racism that’s thrown his way. He just isn’t fazed by it anymore, and his indifference is quite humorous. It also helps us to identify more with his character, as if we are vicariously experiencing his horror. While the other actors and actresses generally do a good job, there are some definite standouts. Lil Rel Howery, who plays Rod, is by far the comedic showstopper. His insight into the crazy events is hilarious and always brings the tone of the film back to comedy. But when it comes to horror, the scene-stealer here is the unnerving and troubled Georgina, played by Betty Gabriel. Her facial expressions and peeled-back smile are enough to make you shudder. Paired with close-up shots that are too much to look at and line delivery that is absolutely haunting, Georgina is sure to become a contemporary — and someday classic — movie “monster.”</p>\n<p>But as far as monsters go, there is no bigger villain here than racism. While this review won’t go too far into detail, it is worth mentioning how politically relevant most of the film is. As expressed above, the film always maintains a lighthearted and entertaining demeanor, but its acknowledgement of the issue of racial microaggression and even the principle of eugenics is something to stop and think about. Rarely does this become too overbearing, as the microaggression within the film ranges from clever and subtle to overly blatant and straight to uncomfortably hilarious.</p>\n<p>What is perhaps most terrifying about Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” is that its fictional world is only a small satirical step away from the one we live in. Aside from its relevant social critiques, the film stands foremost as an immensely fun and engaging feature. It’s nearly impossible to find anything wrong with “Get Out,” which explains its incredible success with the critics. I can’t think of a single person who wouldn’t have a fun time seeing this film. While it’s not the be-all-end-all Kubrick masterpiece that some people are claiming, it is, however, likely to be the most fun you will have at the movies for a very long time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/get-out-conveys-a-message-within-horror/","id":5824,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5823,5822,5821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts","biography":"Not available","articles":[5786,5819,5820,5824,5852,5858,6109],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A Moonlit Evening with the Stars of ‘La La Land’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/La-La-Land-by-Jenny-Luo-13.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The two stars of “La La Land” had come to receive their Outstanding Performers of the Year Awards alongside their director, Damien Chazelle.

After it sank beneath the floor, Gosling and Stone walked onstage to a standing ovation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It did not take either of them long to charm the already won-over audience, with a stoic Gosling dryly noting that the photographers camping out in front of the stage were shooting his every twitch.

Fans eager to get a closer glimpse or even a photo stood behind metal barriers being carefully monitored by security guards. Gosling emerged to renewed squeals with Stone following right behind.

Has it ever bothered you that we as Isla Vista residents seem to have almost no say in our future or how we are governed? Have you ever wondered why the street lighting in Isla Vista is so bad, or why most of Isla Vista has no sidewalks? There is a solution to these problems. The solution is for Isla Vista to become a Community Services District (a lesser government entity than a city), giving us residents a larger say in how Isla Vista is governed.</p>\n<p>In this UCSB Associated Students election, OPP, various candidates and some current A.S. representatives have mentioned the idea of turning Isla Vista into a Community Services District. Because most of you have probably never heard of such a thing, I am going to attempt to explain to you what a CSD is and how it would improve Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s founding was a strange one: UCSB decided to allow developers to come in and build up Isla Vista, instead of purchasing it themselves, and making it part of the UCSB campus. This decision has snowballed into numerous problems and is where we find ourselves for the foreseeable future, whether we like it or not.

But Santa Barbara County is a lot larger than Isla Vista — 4,000 square miles with very diverse populations — compared to Isla Vista, which is just half a square mile and made up mostly of students. They don’t have the ability to give Isla Vista the attention and services it needs for Isla Vista to have the quality of life it should have, and it is for this reason that the law allowing the creation of CSDs was established. It allows residents to decide the type and amount of services provided in that community.</p>\n<p>In 2002-2003, after studying the problems in Isla Vista for two years, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury came to the conclusion that the best solution to all our problems was to turn Isla Vista into a Community Services District. They weren’t the only ones who mentioned the possibility of I.V. becoming a CSD. When Doreen Farr ran for Third District Supervisor, she mentioned that looking into turning I.V. into a CSD might be part of the solution for Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Currently, the only say that Isla Vista voters have over their future is through the elected Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD). Establishing the IVRPD wasn’t easy either. Many home and property owners opposed it because of the increased property taxes that came along with its creation. But, because the IVRPD was established, I.V. now has over 20 parks, compared with only one park at the time of the IVRPD’s founding.</p>\n<p>Looking at Isla Vista’s history, there were many attempts to improve its self-governance, and there were many attempts to turn Isla Vista into a city. All of these attempts failed because of insufficient tax revenue to support the high costs of running a city. Therefore, I don’t think following a failing course is the solution to Isla Vista’s problems. Rather a more practical solution is called for. The only advance in Isla Vistan self-governance that has ever occurred is the creation of the IVRPD, so this is the model that I think we should follow.</p>\n<p>With all the problems that exist in Isla Vista — including lack of sufficient safety for the residents, insufficient lighting, sidewalks, street trees, issues with funding graffiti abatement, the lack of a community center and other community facilities and no singular voice to speak for Isla Vista residents — it is time we build upon over forty years of IVRPD successes by expanding the control and say we have over our own services through the creation of a Community Services District.</p>\n<p>My vision for this is a community where all the lighting in Isla Vista is up to proper standards, where sidewalks will finally be filled in, where the streets will be full of trees rather than just houses, where we don’t have to beg for money to have graffiti removed, where we will have a community center that Isla Vista will make good use of and where an elected board (very similar to a city council) will be able to stand up and speak for the interests of Isla Vista residents to the County, UCSB, the Sheriff’s Department and other entities. It is even possible that the County will appoint the CSD Board as both an official advisory board and an advisory planning board on Isla Vista matters and on Isla Vista’s growth and development plans.</p>\n<p>This project will not be easy. We have support for this project from many entities, including important people in the County and in the Santa Barbara community, but none of them are going to do our work for us. If we want to see an improved Isla Vista, we are going to have to spearhead this project by ourselves. Neither the County, UCSB nor any other entity is going to make this happen for us.</p>\n<p>The project is going to take a few years and up to 100,000 dollars. It will include getting 25 percent of voters in I.V. to sign a petition in support of the project. It will require getting professional financial feasibility studies done. It will also require getting the approval from an appointed California State Board called LAFCO, who will look at this project and decide whether it is in the best interest of the County’s orderly growth and development to create this CSD. And finally, it will take having an election, where Isla Vista residents will decide whether they approve of I.V. becoming a CSD or not.</p>\n<p>Besides the hard work that will go into this project, we will be viciously opposed in the creation of a CSD by the same people who opposed the creation of the IVRPD over 40 years ago. We will be opposed by most property investors, of whom over 90 percent live outside of Isla Vista and care more about their bottom line than their residents’ quality of life. Some homeowners will oppose the CSD as well because they will be against paying higher taxes. I think that living or owning property in Isla Vista comes not only with benefits (living right by the ocean) but also with responsibilities. It is the responsibility of everyone to make sure that Isla Vista is a safe place and has the proper services needed for an area and population of this size.</p>\n<p>So, as hard as the fight will be, I am confident it is one we can win. Our project is a noble one, is feasible and will produce many improvements in Isla Vista. I ask you to do your part to make sure that this project is a success. You might not be here when the project is completed, but think about the good you will be doing for all students and others that come after us.</p>\n<p>If you would like to read up more on the project, read the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury Report from 2002-2003, titled “Isla Vista — Take Charge!” Also, take a look at a 2001 report by Economic &amp; Planning Systems titled “Local Government Options for Isla Vista/UCSB.” If you would like a simple overview on CSD’s, take a look the one-page summary written by California Tax Data titled “What is a Community Services District?” If you are interested in reading deeper into this project, take a look at the law that governs CSD’s, which is California Government Code 61000-61226.5. Also, if you want to read up on the process of creating a CSD, look up California Government Code 56000-57550. All these documents and the law are free online and are easily available through a Google search.</p>\n<p>If you would like to comment on this project, have any further questions about it, would like to read up on it further or would like to get involved and help, feel free to email me at <em>IslaVistaCSD@gmail.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>Josh Plotke is a fifth-year biological anthropology major.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Monday, April 21, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Virtuosos Award ceremony was held in the Arlington Theatre on Feb. 6 at the height of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The eight honorees of the night included Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”), Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Janelle Monáe (“Moonlight” and “Hidden Figures”), Ruth Negga (“Loving”), Stephen Henderson (“Fences”), Simon Helberg (“Florence Foster Jenkins”),  Aaron Taylor-Johnson (“Nocturnal Animals”) and Dev Patel (“Lion”). The Virtuoso Award is a recognition for the breakthrough actors who gave a riveting performance in a film released the previous year.</p>\n<p>The moderator of the night, Dave Karger, acknowledged that six of the actors given the award were people of color (Patel, Henderson, Harris, Ali, Negga and Monae). Despite sentiments of despair that can arise when considering diversity in today’s landscape, the world of film has begun widening its spectrum of inclusion. All of the actors honored with a Virtuosos Award this year brought three-dimensional characters to life with storylines that didn’t submit them into clichéd molds.</p>\n<p>Mahershala Ali was the first recipient of the night, receiving the award for his utterly breathtaking role as Juan, a drug dealer in “Moonlight.” Karger spoke of Ali’s ability to channel dynamic vulnerability into a man who dealt with drugs. Ali drew from personal experiences about the region where he grew up, pointing out that most drug dealers in the area did not embody their exaggerated stereotypes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Most of them never grew up wanting to be drug dealers; they did it because that was the only way they could survive,” Ali said. In regard to the condemnation of his religion in the media, Ali eloquently stated, “The vast majority of Muslims are peace-loving, but the vast majority of media coverage of Muslims is of those who are not.”</p>\n<p>When given the question if he would ever want to pursue making romantic films, Ali responded with “I want to do everything. I want to tell a joke or two, as well. I want to do a comedy or action movie. I’ve done a lot of television, but for now I want to explore more theater and film.”</p>\n<p>As for Ali’s “Moonlight” costar, Naomie Harris, she was hesitant in taking on the role of the drug-addicted Paula, as she thought it would only perpetuate negative stigmas, but ultimately decided to take on the role when she saw the vivid complexities and earnest nature in director Barry Jenkins’s script. Harris is the only actor in “Moonlight” that appears in all three chapters, and the astounding element is that she filmed all of her scenes in just three days. She had to deal with portraying a woman who descends into a desperation of drug dependency. To prepare for the role, Harris had to venture into the depths of YouTube to research drug addicts, as she herself doesn’t consume caffeine, alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p>With the vast collection of serious roles in these movies, Simon Helberg’s role in “Florence Foster Jenkins” alongside Meryl Streep sheds a comedic light on this year’s Virtuosos Awards.</p>\n<p>When the clip of his performance from “Florence Foster Jenkins” was displayed on screen, the crowd was erupting into fits of laughter when they witnessed Helberg’s facial expressions in the scene reacting to Streep’s singing. Helberg had to undergo preparation to freshen up his piano skills to further delve into the role of the pianist, Cosmé McMoon.</p>\n<p>When asked about what it was like working alongside Streep, Helberg said it was “much like a fever dream” and made a knock at the recent comments made about Streep from the President, joking, “She’s very powerful, if not overrated.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Henderson is a newcomer in the framework of film yet a seasoned veteran in the theater component of acting. Henderson played the same role he plays in Denzel Washington’s film adaptation of the August Wilson screenplay, “Fences,” on Broadway in 2010.</p>\n<p>On his lifelong dream of working with Washington, Henderson mused, “If you wait for the train, it’s always going to come to the station.”</p>\n<p>As a surprise to the audience, Janelle Monáe stated that she actually studied drama in college before dedicating her time to music. Her role as Juan’s girlfriend, Teresa, in “Moonlight” marked her film debut and catapulted her into the realms of the Golden Globes and the Oscars.</p>\n<p>Regarding her role, Monáe said, “I wanted to fill a void for the character of Chiron that his mother couldn’t fill because she wasn’t capable due to her drug addiction. It was a reminder to him that he does matter and that he shouldn’t ever think for a moment that he was not worthy of love.”</p>\n<p>Ruth Negga, an Ethiopian-Irish actress, was being presented the Virtuosos Award for her performance in “Loving,” a story of an interracial marriage during the time of segregation. She finalized her interview with Karger about her Oscar-nominated portrayal as Mildred Loving with the compelling message that, “This isn’t just a black story, and it isn’t just an American story.” She added, “It’s my story, and it’s the world’s story.”</p>\n<p>Dev Patel has the charismatic qualities of a Disney prince, and his phenomenal role as Saroo in “Lion” only adds to his charm.</p>\n<p>Patel’s first scene when filming “Lion” was the ending reunion scene, and he expressed that he “spent eight months of sleepless nights on thinking about making this scene perfect.” Patel recounts his portrayal as Saroo as a “process of introspection; I spent a lot of time isolated, traveling on trains in India. I had to write a diary, which I’ve never done before; that makes you confront somethings inside yourself.”</p>\n<p>As the last actor to accept an award, Aaron Taylor-Johnson talked about his sadistic portrayal of the killer Ray in “Nocturnal Animals.” Johnson showed hesitance of taking on this role as he felt it would bring an excessively dark aura into his household, where he is surrounded by his daughters and wife. Due to the gruesome nature of his character, Johnson had to do exhaustive research on serial killers three months prior to the making of the film. While on this intensive diet of serial killer documentaries, Johnson learned that what he had to emulate from these killers into his inherently violent character, Ray, was their dimensions of “charm and charisma.”<br>\nIn regard to starting the production of “Nocturnal Animals,” Johnson said, “I started to have sleepless nights, both from the things I was watching and the anxiety that came from provoking Jake Gyllenhaal’s character.”</p>\n<p>Karger wrapped up the night by asking a final open-ended question to the panel of actors: “What are three dreams that you want to fulfill?” Negga stated that she wants to work with the influential director Spike Lee; Ali would like to someday portray Jack Johnson or the Motown singer-songwriter Marvin Gaye; Monae would like a legacy “Star Wars” movie and to see more predominantly female and minorities in film; Taylor-Johnson would love to work in another one of his wife’s films. This year’s Virtuosos Awards ensemble dared to defy the divisions that are often employed within Hollywood and created compelling performances that enticed audiences across countless screens.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/sbiffs-virtuosos-awards-celebrate-diversity/","id":5823,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[5822,5821,5820],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
