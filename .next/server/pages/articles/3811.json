Officers sprang into action, but the deft boarder evaded capture by weaving in and out of pedestrian traffic.

Her compassionate comrade started crying uncontrollably, also admitted that the pair was friends and said she didn’t want law enforcement to take any action.</p>\n<p>The cops, apparently unmoved by the touching reconciliation, transported the aggressor to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/police-blotter-44/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/police-blotter-44/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/police-blotter-44/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/police-blotter-44/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/police-blotter-44/","id":3809,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3808,3807,3806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Saturday, October 9, 11:59 p.m. — Three cops were departing from a fire scene on the 6700 block of Del Playa when an odd spectacle drew their attention.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>CSI: Crime Scene Intoxication</strong></p>\n<p>Saturday, October 9, 11:59 p.m. — Three cops were departing from a fire scene on the 6700 block of Del Playa when an odd spectacle drew their attention.</p>\n<p>A 19-year-old male had become ensnared in the yellow police tape encircling the emergency area.

Set on freedom, she began kicking the metal plate separating her from the cops until it bent.</p>\n<p>And then the furry fiend successfully smashed out the passenger window with her foot.</p>\n<p>Police rushed back to check on the thrasher but barely opened the door before the freedom fighter burst out. Impervious to the dose of pepper spay she received in her eyes, she bolted into a nearby yard. Cops finally caught up with the determined dasher, employed a rip hobble restraining device and threw her back in the van — where she continued to thrash about until she arrived at Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>In the exam room, the forgetful female said that, while even her bloodied foot felt fine, her eyes were a bit sore — probably because of her mascara.</p>\n<p>She was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety and an improved sense of fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>“Come on, baby, light my fire…”</strong></p>\n<p>Saturday, October 9, 2:18 a.m. — An 18-year-old male trying again and again to light a chair on fire in the middle of the 66-block of Abrego caught the eye of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>When deputies contacted the persistent pyro, he pleaded that he was “just trying to see if the chair would light on fire.” Although the would-be torcher said that he wasn’t entirely sure why he was trying to set the furniture aflame, he noted that it would have been fun had it been successful.</p>\n<p>He was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/police-blotter-63/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/police-blotter-63/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/police-blotter-63/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/police-blotter-63/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/police-blotter-63/","id":3810,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3809,3808,3807],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
